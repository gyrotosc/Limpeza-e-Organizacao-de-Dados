Including game elements and digital services into the students' cognitive activity are the current trends in the development of the didactic system. The designing of an interactive escape room as an organizational form of cognition and learning technology is one of the ways of gamification of the digital educational space. The authors investigate the problems of forming the high-demanded competencies through interactive quest games. These competencies are necessary for graduates to solve future professional tasks and for successful socialization. Research methods. The analysis of fundamental scientific works on the problem of gamification in education and the usage of digital resources for forming high-demanded soft skills were used to obtain theoretical generalizations. The escape room was designed using modern interactive technologies. 48 students of specialty 44.03.01 Pedagogical education (31% of boys and 69% of girls) of Vyatka State University, Kirov, were involved in the designing of game areas for educational purposes. At the control stage of the experiment, the G-criterion was used to evaluate the changes in over-professional competencies being formed. Results. The essence of the concept of an escape room has been clarified as a game space fully adapted to a specific story, and each single element of which is designed to respond to one common plot, including thematic tasks. The stages of designing and implementation of the escape room for educational purposes were described: determination of the system of planned results, over-subject competencies; development of the game scenario; reasonable choice of software and hardware support; correlation of the emotional and psychological component with the filling of the interactive educational space. The empirical value of Gemp=3&lt;Gcr=9 (for p=0.01) obtained in the course of the experiment confirms that the shift towards improving the quality of learning after applying the proposed approach is not random. In conclusion, the authors generalized the factors that provide the effective use of interactive resources of escape rooms to form the high-demanded soft skills: taking into account the peculiarities of game mechanics; professional aspirations and interests; students' cognition style; correlation of actually formed soft skills with planned ones, etc. © 2020 LLC Ecological Help.

One of such phenomena is serious play. Traditionally, the playful and the serious, at the intersection of which serious play arises, are positioned as independent and mutually exclusive elements of the social world. We examine what changes in the social reality, in the relations of the playful and the serious, in the position of man in modern social processes make serious play possible and how serious play redetermines the conditions of its occurrence. For this, we used methods of philosophical analysis and hermeneutics: interpretation, conceptualization, comparative analysis. As a theoretical and methodological basis, we used the categorical apparatus of social philosophy, theory of practice, pragmatism, and social epistemology. As a result, we found that serious play is thought of as a social process in the range from an individual to global scale. In serious play, the subject, through the generation of meanings, performs both the production and reproduction of culture in predetermined ontoaxiological bases, and constructs these bases, while realizing the degree of his freedom, responsibility and immersion in the world he creates through his practices. The significance of the results of our research lies in the fact that the concept of serious play at the intersection of serious and game relations reveals the potential of serious play as an element of sociocultural reality. Serious play reflects the level of complexity of modern reality and ensures that a person adapts to the ever-increasing dynamics of this complexity. The trend of gamification registers this in the space of higher education, which causes a change in the role of the university in the modern social world. Serious play redefines the position of a person in the modern, dynamic and individualized social world. For the first time, serious play is conceptualized at the intersection of the playful and the serious as independent and mutually exclusive elements of sociocultural reality and is analyzed in the trend of the gamification of higher education. © 2020 LLC Ecological Help.

Serious Games (SGs) are a tool with an immensely positive impact and great success. SGs enable learning and provide entertainment and self-empowerment, which motivates students. The development of an SG consists of complex processes requiring multi-disciplinary knowledge in multiple domains, including knowing the learning domain and adding the appropriate game mechanics to foster high intrinsic motivation and positive player experience that makes the players feel like they are having fun while learning. Otherwise, the game is viewed as boring and not as a fun and engaging activity. Nevertheless, despite their potential, the application of SGs in education has been limited in terms of pedagogy. Several authors assert that this lack is because SG standards and guidelines have not been developed. There is an imbalance between experts’ contributions to education and game design specialists for the SG development. Not all the SGs that have been developed have applied appropriate design methodologies that incorporate both the entertainment mechanics and the serious component. To ensure that an SG meets the user’s expectations, it must be designed using an appropriate method. This work aims to present iPlus, a methodology for designing SGs based on a participatory, flexible, and user-centered approach. Additionally, this paper analyses several case studies with the iPlus methodology. © 2020 by the authors.

For data collection, an ad hoc questionnaire was utilized, which was administered to a sample of 232 teachers-in-training. The main result obtained was that the future early childhood education professionals considered that gamification could be a resource for the learning of specific mathematics contents, and this was shaped around a model of two elements. On one hand, the development of mathematical thinking, and on the other, the establishment of relationships between mathematical concepts.

This study measured the extent to which a gamified English as a foreign language classroom adhered to 21 principles of good education proposed by Mind, Brain, and Education (MBE) researchers in comparison to a traditional classroom. It also explored the claim that gamification promotes greater learner autonomy. Two sections of a college English class in Ecuador were used in this study. One was gamified and the other used a traditional education model. Both groups completed a 22 Likert Scale item questionnaire which correlated questions with each MBE principle and one question about perceived autonomy. The teacher and the students also provided comments about the experience. The data showed that the gamified group had higher rankings of perceived adherence to all of the 21 principles and a statement about autonomy with 14 of them being significantly higher. The qualitative data also supported the greater perceived adherence to MBE principles and an increase in perceived autonomy amongst students from the gamified group. It was concluded that gamified instruction did provide a learning environment that adhered more closely to proposals made by MBE researchers for good education and did create an atmosphere where students felt greater control of their learning. © 2020 ACTFL";"best practices; computer-assisted language learning (CALL); English as a Foreign/Second Language (ESL/EFL/ESOL); pedagogy; postsecondary/higher education";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

The use of immersive virtual reality offers exciting, yet largely unexplored solutions to this problem. Taking neuroanatomy as an example of a visually and spatially complex subject, the present study investigated whether academic learning using a state-of-the-art Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) yielded higher learning gains compared to conventional textbooks. The present study leveraged a combination of CAVE benefits including collaborative learning, rich spatial information, embodied interaction and gamification. Results indicated significantly higher learning gains after collaborative learning in the CAVE with large effect sizes compared to a textbook condition. Furthermore, low spatial ability learners benefitted most from the strong spatial cues provided by immersive virtual reality, effectively raising their performance to that of high spatial ability learners. The present study serves as a concrete example of the effective design and implementation of virtual reality in CAVE settings, demonstrating learning gains and thus opening opportunities to more pervasive use of immersive technologies for education.

Methods: A paediatric radiology escape room with accompanying tutorial was developed around key learning objectives set within the RCR and ESR undergraduate curriculum. Students were recruited from two different universities and undertook the escape room themed teaching. An 8-question single best answer (SBA) test was completed before, immediately after and at 2 weeks post-teaching to determine participant improvement and retention of knowledge. The general feedback was also collected. Results: The escape room sessions were held three times, for 19 students (6–7 students per session). All groups completed the escape room in ≤ 20 min. Students enjoyed the experience, assigning an average satisfaction score of 9.4/10 (range 7–10). The majority (17/19, 89.5%) preferred this method of teaching to a lecture-based tutorial alone, although all said they found the tutorial component useful. For the SBA test, there was an average increase in 3.6 marks (range 1–6 marks) per participant between before and after the escape room. This improved knowledge was mostly sustained after 2 weeks, with an average increase of 3.4 marks difference (range 1 to 6) per participant compared to before the teaching.

They also help practice other 21 century skills such as computational thinking, problem solving and teamwork. Unfortunately, learning how to program is tough and can be also frustrating for beginner students. In this work we introduce RoboTIC, a serious game based on gamification and Augmented Reality that facilitates the learning of programming to students in lower levels of the education system by using a novel set of visual metaphors derived from a notation of roads and traffic signs. The architecture that supports RoboTIC has been designed to allow the integration of multimedia components when new programming concepts and techniques must be addressed and to add game levels that enable students to learn incrementally. Experiments have been conducted in a youth center with children who do not have coding skills at all to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal. The results show promising conclusions in terms of children’s motivation and interest in programming. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.";"Augmented reality; Learning programming; Serious games; Visual programming";"Augmented reality; Educational robots; Multimedia systems; Robot programming; Robotics; Students; Traffic signs; Coding skills; Computational thinkings; Education systems; Industrial revolutions; Learning programming; Learning-of-programming; Programming concepts; Visual metaphor; Serious games";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Bronze";"Scopus"

As such, they have high potential as learning tools that can act complementary to traditional teaching approaches. In the field of pharmacology, mobile applications are increasingly being used to improve adherence of patients or to help them report suspect adverse drug reactions. However, they have been scarcely applied to pharmacology education. In this article, we present PharmacoloGenius, a free Android mobile application integrating resources useful for students as well as healthcare professionals or researchers to expand knowledge on pharmacological topics. We gave particular emphasis to pharmacogenetics, as it is a fundamental tool to achieve personalized treatment. The application offers original games such as pharmacological trivia based on textbooks or special “journal club” trivia based on research articles conveying the state of the art on specific topics. Additionally, the app offers a curated list of online resources to study pharmacology and pharmacogenetics (e.g., free online courses, videos, and databases) as well as updated news on conferences, grants, and opportunities for pharmacologists. In conclusion, PharmacoloGenius aims to be a useful instrument for people interested in expanding their knowledge on pharmacology in an engaging way. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, LLC.";"Android app; gamification; personalized medicine; pharmacogenomics";"antidepressant agent; mood stabilizer; neuroleptic agent; psychotropic agent; Article; data base; e-learning; game; health care personnel; human; knowledge; medication compliance; mobile application; personalized medicine; pharmacogenomics; pharmacologist; pharmacology; pharmacovigilance; scientist; student";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

For this, we present a systematic review of ICT-mediated evaluation and assessment according to the educational paradigms and their implementation. We highlight that contemporary pedagogical models and their implementation in ICT mediation tools show a trend towards quantitative and summative valuation. The commonly used learning management systems (LMS) include several types of questions oriented to quantitative evaluation, with multiple-choice being the most common. However, new technological approaches like gamification, virtual reality and mobile learning open new assessment possibilities.

Due to inconsistent practice opportunities in the clinical setting, a disparity of skill levels among students has been observed. In addition, the poor availability of faculty professors is a limiting factor in teaching and adequately preparing medical students for their clerkship years. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, medical students do not have access to traditional suturing learning opportunities. Didactic courses are available on videoconferencing platforms; however, these courses do not include technical training. Objective: Our overarching goal is to evaluate the efficacy and usability of web-based peer-learning for advanced suturing techniques (ie, running subcuticular sutures). We will use the Gamified Educational Network (GEN), a newly developed web-based learning tool. We will assess students’ ability to identify and perform the correct technique. We will also assess the students’ satisfaction with regard to GEN. Methods: We will conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial with blinding of expert examiners. First-year medical students in the Faculty of Medicine of Université de Montréal will be randomized into four groups: (1) control, (2) self-learning, (3) peer-learning, and (4) peer-learning with expert feedback. Each arm will have 15 participants who will learn how to perform running subcuticular sutures through videos on GEN. For our primary outcome, the students’ ability to identify the correct technique will be evaluated before and after the intervention on GEN. The students will view eight videos and rate the surgical techniques using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills Global Rating Scale and the Subcuticular Suture Checklist as evaluation criteria. For our secondary outcomes, students will anonymously record themselves performing a running subcuticular suture and will be evaluated using the same scales. Then, a survey will be sent to assess the students’ acceptance of the intervention. Results: The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and has been approved by our institutional review board (CERSES 20-068-D). No participants have been recruited yet. Conclusions: Peer learning through GEN has the potential to overcome significant limitations related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of availability of faculty professors. Further, a decrease of the anxiety related to traditional suturing classes can be expected. We aim to create an innovative and sustainable method of teaching surgical skills to improve the efficiency and quality of surgical training in medical faculties. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for such tools is imperative. ©Natasha Guérard-Poirier, Michèle Beniey, Léamarie Meloche-Dumas, Florence Lebel-Guay, Bojana Misheva, Myriam Abbas, Malek Dhane, Myriam Elraheb, Adam Dubrowski, Erica Patocskai.";"Advanced sutures; COVID-19; Distance learning; Gamification; Learning platform; Medical education; Medical student; Peer learning; Subcuticular sutures; Surgery; Surgical pedagogy; Video; Web-based learning; Web-based tool";"";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

This “drone programming” course is open-access and ready-to-use for any teacher/student to teach/learn drone programming with it for free. The students may program diverse drones on their computers without a physical presence in this course. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) applications are essentially practical, as their intelligence resides in the software part. Therefore, the proposed course emphasizes drone programming through practical learning. It comprises a collection of exercises resembling drone applications in real life, such as following a road, visual landing, and people search and rescue, including their corresponding background theory. The course has been successfully taught for five years to students from several university engineering degrees. Some exercises from the course have also been validated in three aerial robotics competitions, including an international one. RoboticsAcademy is also briefly presented in the paper. It is an open framework for distance robotics learning in engineering degrees. It has been designed as a practical complement to the typical online videos of massive open online courses (MOOCs). Its educational contents are built upon robot operating system (ROS) middleware (de facto standard in robot programming), the powerful 3D Gazebo simulator, and the widely used Python programming language. Additionally, RoboticsAcademy is a suitable tool for gamified learning and online robotics competitions, as it includes several competitive exercises and automatic assessment tools. © 2020 by the authors.

In this article, an approach based on the divide-and-conquer methodology is proposed to facilitate its learning. The proposed strategy is designed to sequentially explain and evaluate the different concepts involved in hypothesis testing, ensuring that a new concept is not presented until the previous one has been fully assimilated. The proposed approach, which contains several gamification elements (i.e., points or a leader-board), is implemented into an application via a modern game engine. The usefulness of the proposed approach was assessed in an experiment in which 89 first-year students enrolled in the Statistics course within the Industrial Engineering degree participated. Based on the results of a test aimed at evaluating the acquired knowledge, it was observed that students who used the developed application based on the proposed approach obtained statistically significant higher scores than those that attended a traditional class (p-value < 0.001), regardless of whether they used the learning tool before or after the traditional class. In addition, the responses provided by the students who participated in the study to a test of satisfaction showed their high satisfaction with the application and their interest in the promotion of these tools. However, despite the good results, they also considered that these learning tools should be considered as a complement to the master class rather than a replacement. © 2020 by the authors.

In particular, several investigations have highlighted the effectiveness of student response systems, or clickers, in different subjects and disciplines. Although some literature reviews have been published on this subject, none of them offer a review of a large volume of publications from a multidisciplinary approach. Similarly, in the literature there are no studies that have analyzed scientific collaborations on this subject. To respond to these concerns, we proposed the use of a bot to retrieve information from a large number of papers (1696 documents co-authored by a total of 4091 researchers) included in the Scopus database. The disciplines covered include natural sciences, engineering and technology, medical and health sciences, agricultural and veterinary sciences, social sciences and humanities, and the arts. The review of the literature reveals that student response systems are generally well-perceived by teachers and students in all the disciplines. Another interesting result achieved from visual data obtained using network visualization software and word clouds is that student response systems are mainly used in some disciplines, such as physics, chemistry, medicine, and nursing. It is clearly observed that the relationship between researchers from the same country is stronger than between researchers from different countries. Finally, some reflections are included on the role of student response systems in online teaching, especially regarding the changes experienced after the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 by the authors.

Information and communication technology (ICT)-mediated practice methods like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, gamification, and big data, among others, represent a new arena for social work practice. However, educators have been mostly inactive in developing curricula that support student knowledge, training, and decision-making on the adoption of technology for practice. In the United States, the Council on Social Work Education Futures Task Force highlighted this inaction as a matter of critical uncertainty for the field’s future. In contrast, this paper describes how a school of social work rapidly deployed a free, CE training program on the basics of telebehavioral health practice to the social work community to aid their response to COVID-19. The rapid deployment of that training has been distilled as ‘lessons learned’ for those wanting to join in efforts to address the field’s critical uncertainty regarding the adoption of technology.

The goal of this work is to understand how gamification has been used to engage students in peer review activities and to summarize the empirical evidence for its effectiveness. Our main contribution is the presentation of a general model of the peer review process that captures the students’ activities and an examination of the specific actions within this model that have been gamified in the current literature. We also summarize the commonly used game mechanics and the context and year level of courses in which prior research has been conducted, along with the reported effects on student behavior. We find that artifact assessment and artifact creation are the two most commonly gamified actions with respect to our peer review model and that the quantity and quality of both the artifacts and the generated feedback are the most popular reward criteria. In addition, Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) are the discipline areas in which gamified peer review activities are most often reported. In general, while the existing peer review literature reports mostly positive effects of gamification on student engagement, the range of student actions which have been incentivized remains narrow. Key activities, such as student reflection on the feedback received, have been largely unexplored with respect to gamification and thus present useful avenues for future work. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.";"Education; Gamification; Peer assessment; Peer review; Systematic literature review; Systematic review";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

The research has an exploratory nature as it involves the design and pilot test of an application based on gamification known as HEgameApp in an undergraduate program in tourism in the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain). This research study analyses whether students' intention to use this gamified app is determined by their perception of expected benefits (functional, hedonic and social), by the costs associated with the use of the application (loss of privacy and difficulty of use) or by their personal characteristics (attitude towards learning, attitude towards innovation and demographic profile). The results show that expected hedonic and social benefits influence a student's intention to use HEgameApp. Our findings also evidence that students' attitude towards learning as well as to innovation has a positive and significant role in a student's intention to use a gamified app. Finally, the results show that the loss of privacy exerts a moderator effect on the relationship between the intention to use the gamified app HEgameApp and expected functional benefits. Therefore, the empirical results demonstrate that educational community could do a great deal to enhance a student's intention to use gamification strategies leading to the greater application of innovative technological, educational tools in tourism face-to-face learning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd";"Educational technology; Gamification; Intention to use; Motivation; University students";"";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Green";"Scopus"

Of the distinct techniques introduced in the literature to engage students, gamification, is likely the most widely explored and fruitful. Game elements that intrinsically motivate students, such as graphical feedback and game-thinking, reveal more reliable long-term positive effects, but those involve significant development effort. This paper proposes a game-based assessment environment for programming challenges, built on top of a specialized framework, in which students develop a program to control the player, henceforth called Software Agent (SA). During the coding phase, students can resort to the graphical feedback demonstrating how the game unfolds to improve their programs and complete the proposed tasks. This environment also promotes competition through competitive evaluation and tournaments among SAs, optionally organized at the end by the teacher.

This is because it allows the expression of several problems related to digital design, artificial intelligence, databases, compilers, and formal languages, among others, as a sequence of Boolean operations and variables, which can be dealt with by using Boolean algebra methods to optimize algorithms, minimize digital components, and so forth. This study presents a piece of web-based software, denominated as MiniBool, which has been developed with the objective of supporting the learning of Boolean algebra in a blended learning setting. This educational proposal gives students the opportunity to reinforce learning at any time and in any place. It additionally increases the learners’ motivation by including gamification, through the use of a ranking that shows the students’ level of participation. MiniBool was evaluated by means of a formal experiment, which was carried out with Discrete Mathematics students at a higher education institution in Mexico, where two groups were formed randomly: A control group, whose members attended classes and reinforced their knowledge in a traditional manner with a pencil and paper, and an experimental group, which learned in a blended learning context, receiving the same classes as the control group, but reinforcing what they had learned using MiniBool. The statistical results obtained indicate that the use of MiniBool has a positive and motivating effect on learning and that a greater academic performance is achieved than when the traditional teaching-learning method is applied. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC";"blended learning; Boolean algebra; education; gamification; web-based education";"Artificial intelligence; E-learning; Formal languages; Gamification; Learning systems; Motivation; Students; Websites; Academic performance; Discrete mathematics; Experimental groups; Formal Experiments; Higher education institutions; Reinforce learning; Teaching-learning method; Web-based softwares; Boolean algebra";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Green";"Scopus"

It comprises a collection of exercises including recent service robot applications in real life, with different robots such as autonomous cars, drones or vacuum cleaners. It uses Robot Operating System (ROS) middleware, the de facto standard in robot programming, the 3D Gazebo simulator and the Python programming language. For each exercise, a software template has been developed, performing all the auxiliary tasks such as the graphical interface, connection to the sensors and actuators, timing of the code, etc. This also hosts the student’s code. Using this template, the student just focuses on the robot intelligence (for instance, perception and control algorithms) without wasting time on auxiliary details which have little educational value. The templates are coded as ROS nodes or as Jupyter Notebooks ready to use in the web browser. Reference solutions for illustrative purposes and automatic assessment tools for gamification have also been developed. An introductory course to intelligent robotics has been elaborated and its contents are available and ready to use at Robotics-Academy, including reactive behaviors, path planning, local/global navigation, and self-localization algorithms. Robotics- Academy provides a valuable complement to master classes in blended learning, massive online open courses (MOOCs) and online video courses, devoted to addressing theoretical content. This open educational tool connects that theory with practical robot applications and is suitable to be used in distance education. Robotics-Academy has been successfully used in several subjects on undergraduate and master’s degree engineering courses, in addition to a pre-university pilot course. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods A game show-based curriculum was developed from the basic principles of RID, which include the following: (1) distinguishing between clinical manifestations of STIs and management of long-term sequelae of STIs; (2) evaluation and management of common gynecologic infectious diseases, including chronic vaginitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and other pelvic infections; (3) diagnosis and management of perinatal infectious diseases, such as parvovirus, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, toxoplasmosis, and infection-mediated prematurity; (4) evaluation and management of obstetric and gynecologic postoperative infections; and (5) diagnosis and management of acute and chronic human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus infections in pregnancy. OBGYN residents at a large urban academic training program were randomized to either a Jeopardy-style educational game show intervention plus a traditional didactic-based curriculum or traditional didactic-based curriculum alone. The study team recruited participants by sending out an e-mail to all of the residents, detailing the study and consent process. Participants from both the intervention and control groups completed confidence and knowledge-based pretests. Posttests were administered 4 weeks after completion of the pretests. Statistical methods were applied to analyze the data. Results Thirty-eight residents were randomized to a Jeopardy-style game show-based educational intervention (n = 19) or to a traditional didactic-based curriculum (n = 19). All of the participants (100%) completed the pre-and posttests. Pretest median scores were similar between both groups, in which the Jeopardy group had a median score of 48.5 and the traditional group had a median score of 51.4 (P = 0.091). The Jeopardy group median test scores improved between the pretest and posttest (48.5 vs 62.8, P ≤ 0.001). The traditional didactic-based curriculum had a minimal increase in its median posttest scores (51.4 compared with 54.2, P = 0.773). The Jeopardy group had significantly higher posttest median scores and confidence scores than the traditional didactic-based curriculum (Jeopardy = 62.8, traditional = 54.2, P = 0.002). Conclusions A game show-based curriculum improves OBGYN residents' confidence and retention of knowledge regarding RIDs, clinical manifestations and sequelae of STIs, and management of serious long-term consequences of STIs. Additional studies that include longer posttest time intervals are needed to assess the longer-term impact of game show-based curriculum on knowledge retention among OBGYN residents. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.";"game-based learning; gamification; graduate medical education; obstetrics and gynecology; reproductive infectious disease";"Article; clinical feature; controlled study; curriculum; cytomegalovirus infection; female; game show based curriculum; genital tract infection; hepatitis C; herpes zoster; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; male; medical education; parvovirus infection; pelvic inflammatory disease; postoperative infection; randomized controlled trial; resident; sexually transmitted disease; teaching; toxoplasmosis; vaginitis; education; game; gynecology; obstetrics; procedures; sexually transmitted disease; Curriculum; Educational Measurement; Female; Games, Experimental; Gynecology; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Obstetrics; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Teaching";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Objective: The aim of this study was to conceptualize a theory-based and evidence-based mHealth intervention called SMARTFAMILY (SF) that targets physical activity and healthy eating in a collective family-based setting. Subsequently, the app will be refined and re-evaluated to analyze additional effects of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) and gamification features. Methods: A smartphone app based on behavior change theories and behavior change techniques was developed and implemented and will be evaluated with family members individually and cooperatively (SF trial). Existing evidence and gained results were used to refine and will be used to re-evaluate the app (SF2.0 trial). Both trials are cluster randomized controlled trials with 3 measurement occasions. The intervention group uses the app for 3 consecutive weeks, whereas the control group receives no treatment. Baseline measurements (T0) and postintervention measurements (T1) include physical activity (ie, self-reported and accelerometry) and healthy eating measurements (ie, self-reported fruit and vegetable intake) as the primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes (ie, self-reported) are intrinsic motivation, behavior-specific self-efficacy, and the family health climate, complemented by an intentional measure in SF2.0. Four weeks following T1, a follow-up assessment (T2) is completed by the participants, consisting of all questionnaire items to assess the stability of the intervention effects. Mixed-method analysis of covariance will be used to calculate the primary intervention effects (ie, physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake) while controlling for covariates, including family health climate, behavior-specific self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation. Results: This study is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and ethically approved by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. For both trials, it is hypothesized that the apps will positively influence physical activity and healthy eating in the whole family. Furthermore, SF2.0 is expected to produce stronger effects (ie, higher effect sizes) compared to SF. SF app development and piloting are completed. Data acquisition for the SF trial is terminated and discontinued due to the COVID-19 pandemic. SF2.0 app development and piloting are completed, while data acquisition is ongoing. Participant recruitment for the SF 2.0 trial started in February 2020. The results for SF are expected to be published in mid-2021, and the results of SF2.0 are expected to be published in mid-2022. Conclusions: In this study, it is hypothesized that targeting the whole family will facilitate behavior change at the individual level and the family level, as the implemented strategies address changes in daily family life. Furthermore, subsequent app development (SF2.0) with supplementary addition of motivation-enhancing features and a JITAI approach is expected to enhance positive intervention effects. © Kathrin Wunsch, Tobias Eckert, Janis Fiedler, Laura Cleven, Christina Niermann, Harald Reiterer, Britta Renner, Alexander Woll.";"Accelerometer; Behavior change; Digital intervention; Exercise; Family; Food and nutrition; Health behavior; Just-in-time adaptive intervention; Mobile app; Mobile phone; Primary prevention; Randomized controlled trial; Social cognitive determinants; Telemedicine; Wearable electronic devices";"";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

An educational social-networking platform gathered information about the contributions of participants and about the social networks that were formed during the course. A gamification layer with three game elements (points, badges, and leaderboard) was then implemented in the online learning platform. Social network analysis (SNA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to analyze the differences between a treatment and a comparison group (N = 591 and N = 427), using a set of 20 variables for each participant which quantified contributions to the learning platform as well as position and influence in the social network. The results of SNA show that gamification influences the structure of the social network of the course. The results also suggest that the variables cluster similarly for each group and that the linear combination of variables called the first component (F1) is a good descriptor of students' work and position in the network.

A novel application of serious games in engaging and educating end-users has been validated during the last years. However, there is little research focusing on the review of its development trends, categories and approaches. The proposed paper reviews serious games as an engaging medium for building energy consumption. The research focuses on the role of energy-consumption awareness-related education in motivating end-users to save energy and make informed decisions to change energy-related behaviours. This research stresses the approaches to underlining the issue as ascertained from a number of efficiency-related serious games. The investigation suggests the potential impact that serious games can have on changing the domestic practices of householders, in a safe, fun and interactive environment. This would enable householders to investigate alternative ways of meeting energy-consumption targets and realise the limits to their energy-saving potential. It concludes that at present, serious games do not take advantage of the opportunities available in energy monitoring and sub-metering, or real-life energy behaviours. Meanwhile, the existing evaluation framework for the effectiveness of an energy serious game still needs to be further developed. However, active engagement in energy monitoring has contributed to numerous past successes in energy use reduction, and gamification and serious games show great potential for building upon these achievements. © 2020 by the authors.

Previous works deal with teaching about privacy using educational online content, and media literacy. However, these tools do not necessarily promote less risky behaviors, and do not allow the assessment of users' behavior after the learning period. Moreover, few research studies about the effects of social gamification have been performed for this population segment (i.e., teenagers). To address this problem in this article, we propose the use of gamification in an OSN called Pesedia to facilitate the teaching/learning process, and assess its effectiveness in promoting suitable privacy behaviors. We tested our proposal comparing teenagers' performance in two editions of a course about social networks, and privacy (with, and without gamification) for one month. We measured the impact of gamification in the participants' behaviors toward privacy concepts as a consequence of the privacy teaching/learning process, and the participants' engagement in the educational process. The results show that there are significant differences in participants' behavior regarding privacy, and engagement in the gamified social network.

Games have been shown to possess powerful motivators that fuel a person's desire to engage in unattractive activities, such as learning theoretical material. However, to design an educational game that is capable of providing motivated engagement is a challenging task. Previous research has proposed various game motivators and game design principles to alleviate this, but a comprehensive synthesis has yet to appear. In this article, we conducted a systematic literature review that yielded two major contributions: 1) a taxonomy of 56 game motivators in 14 classes; and 2) a taxonomy of 54 educational game design principles in 13 classes, with linkages to the identified game motivators. As a minor contribution, we have also presented a classification of gamification-related terms and proposed different strategies for applying gamification. The results of this article are available for educational game designers and researchers to use as a practical toolkit for the creation and evaluation of motivating educational games that keep players engaged. Moreover, this article is the first step toward the creation of a unified gamification framework. © 2008-2011 IEEE.";"Design principles (DPs); educational games; game design; gamification; motivation; serious games; taxonomy";"Taxonomies; Design Principles; Educational game; Educational intervention; Game design; Systematic literature review; Gamification";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Bronze";"Scopus"

These technologies may be distinguished based on education content and approach into the following three categories: Online-offline digital education, which uses massive open online courses, CD-ROM, and similar learning tools; mobile learning, which uses mobile phones, tablets, and other devices to connect to the Internet of things; and digital simulation education, which uses virtual reality, virtual patient simulation, serious gaming, and gamification. Preliminary positive findings regarding the effectiveness of using the above technologies have been reported in the literature. Therefore, to better understand the impact of new technology, it is recommended that relevant medical/nursing educators should continue introducing practical courses to evaluate their impact on learning.

Students are even more demanding, and professors need to follow the evolution of technology and try to increase student engagement in the classrooms (presential or virtual). Higher education students recognise that the introduction of new tools and learning methods can improve the teaching quality and increase the motivation to learn. Regarding a question about which type of classes students preferred, ninety-one point ninety-nine per cent (91.99%) of the students wanted interactive classes over traditional. Having this concern in mind over the past years, a professor explored a set of methods, strategies and tools and designed a new and innovative paradigm using gamification. This approach is denominated TechTeach and explores a set of trending concepts and interactive tools to teach computer science subjects. It was designed to run in a B-learning environment. The paradigm uses flipped classrooms, bring your own device (BYOD), gamification, training of soft-skills and quizzes and surveys to increase the student’s engagement and provide the best learning environment to students. Currently, COVID-19 is bringing about new challenges, and TechTeach was improved in order to be more suitable for this new way of teaching (from 0% to 100% online classes). This article details this method and shows how it can be applied in a real environment. A case study was used to prove the functionality and relevance of this approach, and the achieved results are motivating. During the semester, more than a hundred students experienced this new way of teaching and assessment. In the end, more than eighty-one per cent (81%) of the students gave a positive grade to the approach, and more than ninety-five per cent (95.65%) of the students approved the use of the concept of BYOD in the classroom.

As other basic engineering subjects, it needs an active participation of the students in the learning process. However, nowadays, one of the main difficult to teach this kind of disciplines is to keep the student's motivation and participation in the learning process. For this reason, the use of new tools, as the educational gamification, can help to change the way to understand and teach this subject (Ballesteros et al., 2019). In this context, the application of game-based activities to engineering education has increased in popularity among students (Blumenfeld et al., 1991). In this work, we present the application of a escape room-based to heat transfer interactive evaluation for third year chemical engineering students. The plot of our escape lab-room is focused on a crazy scientific (Dr. Nusselito Graetzoff) that is obsessed with the heat transfer. He has retained a group of scientists and has the code for a missile launch. It is a national security case! The students (distributed by groups) play the role of heat transfer specialists from different Research Centers, which have to complete two missions: release the imprisoned scientists, and avoid the missile launch planned by Dr. Nusselito. Therefore, the students have to solve different questions/cases related to heat transfer issues, obtaining the codes that will allow them to complete their mission. The plot of the activity is conducted by using videos, in which the different parts of the activity are described. In addition, the professors supervise and help the correct progress of the escape room. We used the same kind of theoretical and applied problems in both evaluation methods, traditional exam and escape room one. After this experience, we can confirm the increase of student participation regarding to previous years. In addition, the students showed enthusiastic attitude (Fig. 1a) and a high satisfaction level. Therefore, the students’ participation of escape lab-room, to heat transfer teaching was completely successful, although this activity only accounts for a 10 % of the total course score. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers";"(6 maximum) escape room; Active learning; Cooperative learning; Gamification; Heat transfer; Student-centered learning";"Heat transfer; Learning systems; Missile launching systems; Missiles; National security; Chemical engineering students; Engineering degrees; Evaluation methods; Learning process; Missile launches; Previous year; Research center; Student participation; Students";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

It is also widely believed that young learners learn the best with the provision of tactile or kinesthetic learning opportunities, which is discounted with digital learning aids. The current study employed the tactile approach to language learning by developing non-digital language games for middle school EFL learners. A quasi-experimental research design was used. The respondents were one hundred class-eight EFL learners from two Saudi schools. The researcher developed five non-digital tactile language games and tested their efficacy with the learners over two months.

Serious games have advantages in the dissemination of reliable information during the pandemic; they can provide qualified content while offering interactivity to the user, and they have great reach over the internet. Objective: This study aimed to develop a serious game with the purpose of providing science-based information on the prevention of COVID-19 and personal care during the pandemic while assessing players’ knowledge about COVID-19–related topics. Methods: The study was conducted with the interdisciplinary collaboration of specialists in health sciences, computing, and design at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The health recommendations were grouped into six thematic blocks, presented in a quiz format. The software languages were based on the progressive web app development methodology with the Ionic framework, JavaScript, HTML5, cascading style sheets, and TypeScript (Angular). Open data reports of how users interact with the serious game were obtained using the Google Analytics application programming interface. The visual identity, logo, infographics, and icons were carefully developed by considering a selection of colors, typography, sounds, and images that are suitable for young audiences. Cards with cartoon characters were introduced at the end of each thematic topic to interact with the player, reinforcing their correct answers or alerting them to the need to learn more about the disease. The players’ performance was assessed by the rate of incorrect and correct answers and analyzed by linear correlation coefficient over 7 weeks. The agile SCRUM development methodology enabled quick and daily interactions of developers through a webchat and sequential team meetings. Results: The game “COVID-19–Did You Know?” was made available for free on a public university website on April 1, 2020. The game had been accessed 17,571 times as of September 2020. Dissemination actions such as reports on social media and television showed a temporal correspondence with the access number. The players’ error rate in the topic “Mask” showed a negative trend (r=–.83; P=.01) over the weeks of follow-up. The other topics showed no significant trend over the weeks. Conclusions: The gamification strategy for health education content on the theme of COVID-19 reached a young audience, which is considered to be a priority in the strategy of orientation toward social distancing. Specific educational reinforcement measures were proposed and implemented based on the players’ performance. The improvement in the users’ performance on the topic about the use of masks may reflect an increase in information about or adherence to mask use over time. © Juliano De Souza Gaspar, Eura Martins Lage, Fernando José Da Silva, Érico Mineiro, Isaias José Ramos De Oliveira, Igor Oliveira, Rayner Guilherme De Souza, Juan Rodrigues Oliveira Gusmão, Camila Fernanda Donadoni De Souza, Zilma Silveira Nogueira Reis.";"Coronavirus; COVID-19; Digital health; E-learning; Gamification; Informatics; MHealth; Mobile apps; Public health; Serious game";"";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

Background: We adapted an evidence-based, flexibly delivered program for use with low-income, unmarried couples, for whom the outcome literature is scarce. Method: Couples (N = 443) were recruited from maternity units and began CCP. They completed measures before, during, and immediately after the intervention and again 6 months later. Results: Experience of moderate psychological intimate partner violence (IPV) declined and perceived parenting efficacy increased over time; there was no change in severe psychological or physical IPV. Individuals with lower levels of relationship commitment than their partners showed improvement in relationship satisfaction, whereas those with similar or higher levels of commitment maintained their baseline levels despite being in a period of expected satisfaction decline. Conclusion: CCP showed some signs of helping low-income couples during a stressful period, and its flexible service delivery model allowed these couples to participate by reducing the impediments of transportation challenges, conflicting work schedules, and overall time poverty. Implications: The results of this study suggest practitioners interested in using CCP with low-income couples would likely maximize the impact by (a) focusing on pregnant, first-time parents; (b) integrating CCP within postnatal health care; and (c) assuming that a considerable minority of couples will avail themselves of only up to two sessions, and thus practitioners should frontload content, making other content optional or just-in-time.

As mental health can strongly influence academic performance, addressing the loss of community by transitioning to distance education, midsemester, is imperative. This work draws upon the community and wellness benefits associated with online gaming and applies it to ChemDraw. The goal is to improve the class' wellness and social community while teaching valuable organic chemistry skills. In this paper, a molecule, speed-drawing tournament (Molecule Madness) is presented along with reflections describing the impacts on student wellness and organic chemistry skills. Gamification of ChemDraw is achieved by (1) treating at-home practice as video-game training and (2) using video-conferencing software as a medium for multiplayer gameplay. As the primary focus is placed on education rather than entertainment, ChemDraw is subclassified as a serious educational game. Community is developed by in-game, online chat: observers, announcers, and competitors all interact with each other in real time. The tournament provided students an event to look forward to, helped maintain/improve class community, and developed organic chemistry skills (molecular drawing, history of molecules, and conversational IUPAC) in addition to increased appreciation for IUPAC nomenclature. Although an online community cannot substitute for in-person classroom experiences, this activity supplements the loss of community associated with social distancing and could be extended to enhance community within a face-To-face environment. Additionally, ideas are presented that illustrate how other chemistry classes and topics can be gamified in computer environments (both single-and multiplayer) by drawing upon well-established gaming modes (story mode, maker mode, and speed runs). Overall, this work highlights the supplemental role that chemistry video games can play in learning chemistry: by engaging students in an alternative, yet familiar to many format, classroom community and student confidence are maintained/strengthened.

To our knowledge, empirical research on its effectiveness in education is scarse, and almost absent in physical education. Purpose: The goal was to explore how Gamification can be used in physical education, and what experiential effects may have on students and teachers. Participants and settings: Two hundred and ninety students (age range 6–14 years) enrolled in four schools located in four regions of Spain agreed to participate. The study involved five different grades (from year two of primary school to year two of secondary school), and 12 different classes. Four physical education teachers, one from each school, also agreed to participate. All participating classes experienced the same intervention programme: MarvEF [MarvPE], based on the Marvel universe of super heroes. The project lasted 15 weeks, the whole fall semester, for a total of 30 physical education sessions (2 per week/50 min each). Gamification was the basic methodological approach used to design the three consecutive learning units experienced by all the participating students. Research design: The study followed a pre-experimental, one group pre-test-post-test design, where the same dependent variable (intrinsic motivation) is measured in only one group of participants prior and after the intervention. Data collection: A mixed methods approach was followed. It included quantitative information obtained from a questionnaire for the older students (n = 161), and qualitative information extracted from the younger students’ drawings (n = 126), discussion groups with the participating teachers (n = 5), and teachers’ diary (n = 2). Data analysis: Quantitative data was analysed using the statistical package SPSS (version 22.0). Qualitative data was assessed through content analysis and constant comparison. Findings: Quantitative results showed a significant increase in the students’ intrinsic motivation after experiencing Gamification. Students’ responses reflected one major theme: enjoyment, and two minor themes: friends and learning. On the other hand, teachers’ responses showed three themes: workload, portfolio and narrative. Conclusions: Gamification, implemented on a long-term basis, has been found an instructional framework capable of increasing students’ motivation towards physical education, beyond the initial ‘novelty effect’. Students enjoyed the different approach, and some, despite their young age (seven-eight years), believed that they have learned (which upgrades the education value of the subject). Four of the five elements identified as central to promote meaningful experiences in physical education and sport appeared in this study (Beni, Fletcher, and Ní Chróinín [2017]. ‘Meaningful Experiences in Physical Education and Youth Sport: A Review of the Literature.’ Quest (grand Rapids, Mich) 69 (3): 291–312.): social interaction, fun, challenge and learning. Therefore, Gamification has the ingredients to foster significant physical education experiences in different educational levels (primary and secondary education), in students with different social (low, medium and high socio-economic status) and educational backgrounds (urban, rural) and teachers with different expertise on Gamification (novel and experienced). Finally, as expected, teachers showed concern for the workload of the new pedagogical approach. © 2020 Association for Physical Education.";"Gamification; primary; secondary; students; teachers";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Various workshop designs that incorporated numerous gamification elements were compared with non-gamified workshop designs, tested and refined over time. The improved workshop designs led to increased levels of knowledge retention that exceeded the benchmark values from educational literature. We found that gamification exerts a positive impact on knowledge retention. We tested for the moderating effects of gender and age and found no effect of the former and inconsistent results for the latter. The steady increase in students’ learning performance resulting from constant refinement of the workshops demonstrates the usefulness of incorporating gamification principles into educational activities. © 2020";"Education; Experiments; Gamification; Knowledge retention; Longitudinal study; Workshops";"Gamification; Action research; Educational activities; Knowledge retention; Learning performance; Longitudinal study; Moderating effect; Teaching contents; Tertiary education; Students; action research; article; education; female; gender; human; human experiment; learning; longitudinal study; male";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

The objective of this paper is to explore whether and how different approaches for designing medical educational tools affect students’ learning performance. Materials and methods: Four versions of an educational tool for the study of clinical cases were implemented: a 2D version, a gamified 2D version, a gamified 3D version, and a gamified immersive-virtual-reality version. All complying with the same functional requirements. Each version was used and evaluated by an independent group of students. The participants (n = 78) evaluated the applications regarding usefulness, usability, and gamification. Afterward, the students took an exam to assess the retention of information on the clinical cases presented. Results: One-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank tests confirmed that the participants perceived that it was at least quite likely that gamification helped improved their learning. In addition, based on the participants’ perception, the gamification of the immersive-virtual-reality version helped the most to improve their learning performance in comparison with the gamified 2D and 3D versions. Conclusions: Regardless of whether different versions of a medical educational tool (complying with the same functional requirements) are perceived as equally useful and usable, the design approach (either 2D, 3D, or immersive-virtual-reality with or without gamification) affects students’ retention of information on clinical cases. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.";"Comparative case study; Healthcare education; Virtual reality";"E-learning; Gamification; Students; Design approaches; Educational tools; Functional requirement; Health care education; Immersive virtual reality; Learning performance; Virtual-reality environment; Wilcoxon signed rank test; Virtual reality; adult; article; controlled study; education; female; human; human experiment; human tissue; learning; major clinical study; male; perception; virtual reality; Wilcoxon signed ranks test; health care delivery; medical education; Delivery of Health Care; Education, Medical; Humans; Learning; Virtual Reality";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

This paper presents the design and deployment of a game conducted in parallel with two groups of the engineering course “operations research”. The game design is theoretically supported, and unlike literature, the game proposed has the main distinguishing features: (a) it is carried out in parallel with the standard course, where player participation is optional, with extrinsic motivators regarding the final grade, (b) it lasts the entire semester, and it was applied to different groups with the same instructor, (c) in addition to academic performance, it has other social relatedness desired outcomes, (d) it combines the use of specific game elements divided in three types of activities: Mastery, related to the core topics of the class, Institutional, related to the university life and community, and Teamwork activities; and (e) it uses a WhatsApp chat group as the common communication platform. The assessment is twofold: the effects on learning, measured in two indicators, failure rate and average grade; and the perception of the game itself.

This model combines the advantages of gamification, the flipped classroom and the use of low-fidelity clinical simulation, also including self-reflection and peer evaluation of the situations experienced. Objectives: To evaluate the students' perception of the implementation of GREENS© as a learning and assessment tool in an academic course at the University of Almeria. Design: A cross-sectional descriptive study. Settings: Academic year 2018/2019, at the University of Almeria (UAL), Spain. Participants: 77 students enrolled in their 2nd year of the Nursing Degree who attended the “Health Promotion and Safety” class. Methods: After completing the GREENS© activity, the perception and anxiety of students were analyzed through an online ad hoc questionnaire composed of 17 questions. Data were collected in January 2019. Results: All of the questions scored above 4 out of a maximum of 5 on a Likert scale.

Despite some known positive effects of serious games on learning, critical voices claim that the objectives of a specific game often do not match the learning objectives and that the games focus on entertaining much more than learning. Considering these arguments and some general guidelines of using games in (higher) education, we developed a game on typical chemical misconceptions based on the popular game “Activity©” using Participatory Action Research. The game was developed based on the contents of a seminar on misconceptions for pre-service teachers (M. Ed. students) in a northern German university.

But when the feeling of anxiety is persistent and interferes with a person's day to day life then this may likely be an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are a common issue worldwide and can fall under general anxiety, panic attacks, and social anxiety among others. They can be disabling and can impact all aspects of an individual's life, including work, education, and personal relationships. It is important that people with anxiety receive appropriate care, which in some cases may prove difficult due to mental health care delivery barriers such as cost, stigma, or distance from mental health services. A potential solution to this could be mobile mental health applications. These can serve as effective and promising tools to assist in the management of anxiety and to overcome some of the aforementioned barriers. The objective of this study is to provide an analysis of treatment and management-related functionality and characteristics of high-rated mobile applications (apps) for anxiety, which are available for Android and iOS systems. Method: A broad search was performed in the Google Play Store and App Store following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol to identify existing apps for anxiety. A set of free and highly rated apps for anxiety were identified and the selected apps were then installed and analyzed according to a predefined data extraction strategy. Results: A total of 167 anxiety apps were selected (123 Android apps and 44 iOS apps). Besides anxiety, the selected apps addressed several health issues including stress, depression, sleep issues, and eating disorders. The apps adopted various treatment and management approaches such as meditation, breathing exercises, mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. Results also showed that 51% of the selected apps used various gamification features to motivate users to keep using them, 32% provided social features including chat, communication with others and links to sources of help; 46% offered offline availability; and only 19% reported involvement of mental health professionals in their design.

The attendance of a course on medical terminology is mandatory for human and dental medicine students in Germany. Students' prerequisites when entering the course are diverse and the key learning objectives are achieved to a varying degree. Methods: A new learning space, the ""TERMInator"", was developed at the University Medicine Greifswald to meet the medical students' individual learning needs better. The interactive e-learning course serves as a supplement to the seminars, lectures and tutorials to rehearse and practically apply the course contents at an individual pace. It uses gamification elements and is supplied via the learning platform Moodle. The TERMInator was pilot implemented in two consecutive winter terms (2018/19, 2019/20) and comprehensively evaluated based on the general course evaluations and an anonymous questionnaire covering aspects of content, layout and user friendliness of the TERMInator and questions concerning the students' learning preferences. Results: The TERMInator was rated very positively overall, which was also fed back to the lecturers during the classes. Students appreciate the new e-learning tool greatly and stress that the TERMInator should be further expanded. The handling of the TERMInator was considered to be very easy and, therefore, almost no training time was needed. The tasks were easy to understand and considered a good supplement to the seminar contents. The extent and quality of the images were seen rather critically. The students' learning strategies differ. Although e-learning options were generally rated as very important, student tutorials were considered by far the most important. Conclusions: Medical terminology classes are characterised by heterogeneous learning groups and a high workload within a short time, which can lead to major challenges for the teaching staff. Complementary gamified e-learning tools are promising in view of the students' different knowledge levels and changing learning behaviour.

GAPc is an online active student-centered remedial teaching tool allowing prospective and enrolled students to electronically assess their knowledge of basic and advanced chemistry concepts via different game levels of expertise. This provides them with ways to correct potential shortcomings in view of academic education. A large number of exercises with different degrees of difficulty, links to additional sources of information, automated feedback, and the integrated grading center are key features of GAPc. Notwithstanding that GAPc is conceived as a distance learning and self-learning tool, it works equally well in a classroom setting. Indeed, GAPc was initially meant as a trajectory for precollege students to remediate their acquainted knowledge of chemistry by easy remote access. Today, on the Hasselt University Campus, GAPc is used in the chemistry summer school for senior high school students, and in chemistry courses for freshmen and sophomores enrolled in curricula with a major chemistry component.

This was achieved by examining the overall effect size, identifying which gamification design elements (e.g., badges) were used, and determining under what circumstances (e.g., engineering education) gamification works. The final corpus of data included 30 independent studies and associated effect sizes comparing gamification to non-gamification conditions while accounting for N = 3083 participants. The overall effect size using a random-effects model is g =.464 [.244 to.684] in favor of the gamification condition, which is a small to medium effect size. We examined 14 different gamification design elements (e.g., leaderboards) and showed that each leads to different effects on student learning outcomes. Further, the type of publication (e.g., journal article), student classification (e.g., undergraduate), and subject area (e.g., mathematics) are also investigated as moderators.

This is the case of Flipped Classroom, which is based on a mixed approach between e-learning and face-to-face teaching, as well as gamification, which bases its didactic principles on the recreational components of the games. Within this context, the aim of this research is to observe what effect the application of Flipped Classroom and gamification has in the development of motivation, autonomy and self-regulation towards learning through a didactic unit on healthy habits and diet in 202 students of 6th grade of Primary School from four different schools (public and state-subsidized) in the city of Granada (Spain). For this purpose, a methodological design was used with pre-test and post-test to check the effects of the experience on the students. The findings obtained showed that the application of these methods promoted an increase in students’ motivation, as well as in their autonomy and self-regulation when facing the contents of the subject.

These fears lack a scientific basis, as role-playing games may be useful in education. Educational trends such as gamification are helping to change this perspective, incorporating elements of RPGs in applications like learning management systems (LMS), e.g., Classcraft. Given the increased research interest in this topic, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) report on the state-of-the-art related to RPGs in an Ibero-American education research context. In the study, a comprehensive search is carried out for the most relevant research papers indexed in Latindex, founded through the virtual repository Dialnet for papers between 2010 and 2019 in the field of education. The search chain was 'role-playing games', erasing those topics not related. Results show that there are several relevant references, even though they do not seem to have had a great impact.

For uncommon events in medicine, such as pediatric CPR, more frequent training is associated with improved performance among healthcare providers and physicians in training. Gamified learning may facilitate motivation to practice CPR, though studies to support this are lacking. Intervention. Residents were interviewed to understand motivating factors for CPR practice outside of a traditional classroom certification setting. Methods. We used a qualitative study design within a larger multinational study. Semi-structured, one-on-one interviews were completed with pediatric residents using a constructivist approach. Transcripts were reviewed independently by two authors (IHG, JLS). Results. The inductive framework gradually moved away from gamification and towards that of self-determination. Participating residents reported several types of intrinsic and extrinsic motivational drivers towards practicing CPR, such as practicing CPR to prepare, or as a connection to clinical practice. Some themes were amotivational, such as performance anxiety, and detracted from their drive to practice. Despite a gamification design to this curriculum, these components were rarely mentioned. These themes related to achieving Maslow’s three psychological needs of autonomy, relatedness and competence. Conclusion. The motivation to practice CPR among residents aligns with the self-determination theory. By stimulating intrinsic motivating factors, future curriculum design may better motivate residents to practice CPR. © The Author(s) 2020.";"cardiopulmonary resuscitation; gamification; medical education; medical simulation; pediatrics";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Few patients persistently engage long-term to improve health outcomes, even when they are aware of the consequences of poor adherence. Despite the potential of mobile phone apps as a tool to manage medication adherence, there is still limited evidence of the impact of these innovative interventions. Real-world evidence can assist in minimizing this evidence gap. Objective: The objective of this study was to analyze the impact over time of a previously implemented digital therapeutic mobile app on medication adherence rates in adults with any chronic condition. Methods: A retrospective observational study was performed to assess the adherence rates of patients with any chronic condition using Perx Health, a digital therapeutic that uses multiple components within a mobile health app to improve medication adherence. These components include gamification, dosage reminders, incentives, educational components, and social community components. Adherence was measured through mobile direct observation of therapy (MDOT) over 3-month and 6-month time periods. Implementation adherence, defined as the percentage of doses in which the correct dose of a medication was taken, was assessed across the study periods, in addition to timing adherence or percentage of doses taken at the appropriate time (±1 hour). The Friedman test was used to compare differences in adherence rates over time. Results: We analyzed 243 and 130 patients who used the app for 3 months and 6 months, respectively. The average age of the 243 patients was 43.8 years (SD 15.5), and 156 (64.2%) were female. The most common medications prescribed were varenicline, rosuvastatin, and cholecalciferol. The median implementation adherence was 96.6% (IQR 82.1%-100%) over 3 months and 96.8% (IQR 87.1%-100%) over 6 months. Nonsignificant differences in adherence rates over time were observed in the 6-month analysis (Fr(2)=4.314, P=.505) and 3-month analysis (Fr(2)=0.635, P=.728). Similarly, the timing adherence analysis revealed stable trends with no significant changes over time. Conclusions: Retrospective analysis of users of a medication adherence management mobile app revealed a positive trend in maintaining optimal medication adherence over time. Mobile technology utilizing gamification, dosage reminders, incentives, education, and social community interventions appears to be a promising strategy to manage medication adherence in real practice. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Design: Prospective, single-blinded, pilot, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Large university teaching hospital. Participants: Participants were anesthesiology residents on their cardiac anesthesiology rotation. Interventions: EchoEducator, a TEE image–based smartphone application of learning content through questions, was developed. Content was derived from the Examination of Special Competence in Basic Perioperative Transesophageal Echocardiography and the Objective Structured Clinical Examination portion of the APPLIED Examination and focused on identification of basic TEE views, cardiac structures, and pathology. Residents were randomly assigned to receive access to either the application or to standard intraoperative teaching. Thirty residents met inclusion criteria, and 18 residents completed the study. A pre-intervention assessment was given at the beginning of the rotation, and a post-intervention assessment was given after 2 weeks. Measurements: The primary outcome was the difference between the post-test score and the pre-test score. Standard bivariate statistics and the chi-square test were used for categorical variables, and the Student t test was used for continuous variables. Tests were 2-sided, and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The intervention group demonstrated a greater increase in score; (+19.19% [95% confidence interval 4.14%-34.24%]; p = 0.02) compared with the control group.

The process of creating a gamified system and its influence on human behavior reflect the interaction between educators and machines. Objective: The purpose of this pilot study was to present Ethoshunt as a gamification-based mobile app that can be used in teaching and learning ethics. Methods: This study involved a mixed-methods research design. The researchers surveyed 39 undergraduate students who were introduced to Ethoshunt in order to examine the relationships between mobile app usability and positive emotions, ethical competency, and user experience. Affinity diagramming was used as a tool to organize the opinions and experiences of participants using featured gamification elements. Results: Game dynamics and game mechanics explained the functionality of Ethoshunt. In addition, the learning flow through Ethoshunt was discussed. Overall, the findings were positive, and mobile app usability had the strongest relationship with positive emotions (r=0.744, P<.001), followed by ethical competency (r=0.686, P<.001) and user experience (r=0.614, P<.001). Conclusions: Positive emotions could be perceived as an important dimension in the development and usability of Ethoshunt. The researchers suggest that the gamification-based mobile app advocated in this study may provide ideas for ethics educators who wish to develop a technology-mediated learning environment. © 2020 JMIR Publications.

Maintaining optimal oral hygiene among children is challenging and can be supported by using relevant motivational approaches. Objective: The primary aim of this study was to identify mobile smartphone apps that include gamification features focused on motivating children to learn, perform, and maintain optimal oral hygiene. Methods: We searched six online app stores using four search terms (“oral hygiene game,” “oral hygiene gamification,” “oral hygiene brush game,” and “oral hygiene brush gamification”). We identified gamification features, identified whether apps were consistent with evidence-based dentistry, performed a quality appraisal with the Mobile App Rating Scale user version (uMARS), and quantified behavior scores (Behavior Change score, uMARS score, and Coventry, Aberdeen, and London-Refined [CALO-RE] score) using three different instruments that measure behavior change. Results: Of 612 potentially relevant apps included in the analysis, 17 met the inclusion criteria. On average, apps included 6.87 (SD 4.18) out of 31 possible gamification features. The most frequently used gamification features were time pressure (16/17, 94%), virtual characters (14/17, 82%), and fantasy (13/17, 76%). The most common oral hygiene evidence-based recommendation was brushing time (2-3 minutes), which was identified in 94% (16/17) of apps. The overall mean uMARS score for app quality was high (4.30, SD 0.36), with good mean subjective quality (3.79, SD 0.71) and perceived impact (3.58, SD 0.44). Sufficient behavior change techniques based on three taxonomies were detected in each app. Conclusions: The majority of the analyzed oral hygiene apps included gamification features and behavior change techniques to perform and maintain oral hygiene in children. Overall, the apps contained some educational content consistent with evidence-based dentistry and high-quality background for oral self-care in children; however, there is scope for improvement. © Nino Fijačko, Lucija Gosak, Leona Cilar, Alenka Novšak, Ruth Masterson Creber, Pavel Skok, Gregor Štiglic.

It uses a mixed methods analysis consisting of the observation of teacher-student interaction and student motivation questionnaires to demonstrate the impact of this innovative teaching approach on both genders. The sample consisted of 55 students from a school in the Region of Murcia (28 girls and 27 boys) aged 13 to 17 (M = 14.29; SD = 0.875) from two courses in 2nd- and 3rd-year lower secondary education. The observational analysis of the teacher's performance and teacher-student interactions was conducted by recording ten sessions on video, coded with the Personal and Social Responsibility Observation (SORPS) instrument and recorded with the LINCE v.2.0 software. The THEME v.6 Edu. software was used to obtain the behavioural temporal patterns (t-patterns). The Secondary Education Motivation Scale (EME-S) was administered to analyse the students' self-determined motivation and the data were entered in the SPSS v.22.0 statistical program to perform the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The results showed a clear assignment of autonomy and responsibility to the participants in the teacher's behaviours which generated greater self-determined motivation among the students. In conclusion, the application of a programme based on hybridising the TPSR pedagogical model and gamification is effective in improving student levels of autonomy, responsibility and motivation. © Copyright Generalitat de Catalunya (INEFC).

This paper presents the results of a training program with future Primary Education teachers using gamification and flipped-classroom strategies and techniques. The aim was that teachers in training acquire competences in proposing innovative teaching units. The learning achieved through the program was evaluated by collecting perceptions via a questionnaire and using an observation scale of the didactic units designed. The program was implemented in four classroom groups (N = 210) at the University of Murcia (Spain). Descriptive statistics are shown; mean tests (t of Student and ANOVA of one factor); non-parametric tests (U-Mann Whitney test); and Pearson correlations between subscales. The data show a very positive assessment of the learning achieved and the strategies applied in the training program. The learning outcomes were satisfactory, although lower than perceived.

The article focuses on the effective use of educational interactive technologies in foreign language communication and research activities of students. The purpose of this study is to identify factors which determine the impact of interactive gaming services on formation of students' terminological competence and foreign language proficiency. Materials and Methods. The research methodology involves reviewing literature on the use of interactive game resources in foreign language teaching, as well as analysis and synthesis of the obtained data. The methodological approach taken in this study is the system-activity approach. The educational experiment involved evaluating the possibilities of interactive resources conducted by teachers and assessment of students' foreign language proficiency and research skills. Results. The authors analyze and clarify the concepts of 'interactive game technology' and 'foreign language proficiency'. They argue that development of terminological competence is one of the key stages in formation of foreign language proficiency. The study has revealed the influence of interactive services on organizational aspects of students' communication in a foreign language as well as their research activities. The authors justify the necessity of using interactive game resources in teaching a foreign language as the basis of professional training which meets the requirements of modern digital society. The findings of the survey suggest that teachers are increasingly interested in employing interactive game resources for educational purposes. On the other hand, they report practical difficulties in using them. The empirical study enabled to identify digital tools and interactive technologies which contribute to enhancing foreign language proficiency. Conclusions. In conclusion, the authors summarize the factors determining the influence of interactive technologies on the formation of students' terminological competence and foreign language proficiency through encouraging involvement in learning and research activities within the framework of digital educational environment. © 2020 Novosibirsk State Pedagogical University.

Firstly, this research aims at helping countries implement an equitable, innovative and context-appropriate stay-home game plan for the millions of disadvantaged and under-privileged students severely affected by the forfeiture of school closures; and secondly, this study proclaims that the burgeoning popularity of gamification has the potential to lay the bedrock foundation for ‘Literacy in the New Norm’. Design/methodology/approach: The temporal closure of schools around the world to limit the spread of the COVID-19 has resulted in massive educational disruptions triggering adverse effects and bringing much of education under grave threat. Through a review of the current empirical and conceptual literature, this study proposes a new gamification concept in a non-technology environment. Findings: Well underway are global dialogues that hold conversations on implementing mitigation strategies to counter the looming global health crisis. This has generated the impetus for a more concerted effort by concerned governments and international organizations to identify appropriate solutions for the continuity of learning so that the learning never stops. While educators and learners plunge further into the core of reconstructing education, the authors recognize that the fundamentals of technology and virtual connectivity have all along contributed to the multi-faceted e-learning stage set. However, concerns regarding the paradigm shift to remote online learning would certainly exacerbate inequalities cardinally felt across disadvantaged communities around the globe. Originality/value: As the world is currently bound by strict isolation measures, learners of all ages have been relegated to the confines of their homes. For the most part, the stark realities of technological mishaps that have befallen underprivileged school children, serve as a reminder to help target children all over the world who are in most peril of losing ground in terms of continued education. It is on these grounds that the criterion set out in this article elucidates the nature and scope of a supplementary stay-home game plan detailing the use of game affordances that bear intelligently in the creation of home-based activities for parents to give it their best effort in fostering a collaborative and meaningful parent-child relationship that spawns the new language of literacy in the new norm. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.";"COVID-19; Gamification elements; Literacy in the new norm; Non-tech gamification; Non-tech learning environment; Parent-led programme; Stay-home game plan";"";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Bronze";"Scopus"

Disease self-management is essential for adequate metabolic control to prevent acute and long-term complications. Yet common methods of diabetes self-management education, such as lectures or pamphlets, lead to low knowledge, engagement, and clinical outcomes. Game-based learning has led to increased motivation, engagement, and productivity overall with substantial increases in self-management of chronic diseases in children. The purpose of this article is to review and synthesize literature on the impact on self-management knowledge, behavior, and engagement of the game-based interventions of serious games and gamification for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Nine studies were reviewed. Results showed statistically significant differences in knowledge, behavior, and engagement in response to the game-based interventions. Knowledge outcomes were found most significant in serious game interventions, while behavioral outcomes were predominantly found in gamification/serious game combination interventions. Findings also reveal there was inconsistent use of theories for game development and moderate to low quality of evidence across studies. While the nine studies reviewed strongly demonstrate the potential of game-based tools to significantly improve type 1 diabetes self-management care, further studies with expanded and more rigorous study parameters are recommended before an outright change in practice may be applied. The potential impact of the clinical nurse leader in the use and research of game-based interventions is also discussed. Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Scholars and practitioners in the field of education call for innovative ways of engaging youth-a reason why gamification has gained more attention in recent years. This paper aims at exploring the role of gamification in affecting pro-environmental behavioral change and searching for best practices for educational purposes. For that aim, pro-environmental gamification platforms are identified and analyzed by applying two different frameworks: the Octalysis Framework and the Climate Change Engagement through Games Framework. After scanning 181 cases, a final sample of six is analyzed and two of them are selected as best practices with higher potential to engage users in pro-environmental behavioral change: SaveOhno and JouleBug. Meaning, ownership, and social influence, as well as achievability, challenge, and credibility, are seen as core elements that can increase the success of gamification platforms. In conclusion, the more attributes are enclosed in the gamification design, the stronger physical and mental connections it builds up with participants.

It is one of the most challenging problems inherent in all forms and levels of education, especially in e-learning. It can be partially solved through gamification. In foreign countries, gamification is a recognized technology having methodological and didactic advantages; it has been actively studied and used for many years. In Russia, this promising and popular technology has been addressed and started developing only recently. It should be noted that most studies on gamification (both Russian and foreign) tend to focus on its stimulus-response patterns without delving into its motivational capabilities underlying its efficiency. There is not enough understanding of the differences between external and internal motivations and their role in gamification to create a long-term and sustainable effect. Our research intends to make a theoretical contribution to this field. For this purpose, we look into gamification in terms of philosophical and cultural approaches and analyze motivation theories with regard to gamification. We will use the key concepts of philosophy of pragmatism and social phenomenology and the Self-Determination Theory (SDT), the flow theory and the Transactional analysis (TA) as a theoretical and methodological framework. The philosophical concepts that we took as a theoretical and methodological basis have never been used in gamification analysis. Thus, they represent scientific novelty of our research. Based on the research results, the authors substantiate the thesis that intrinsic motivation plays an essential (but not an exclusive!) role in gamification. It is game thinking that contributes to the formation of internal motivation, in contrast to the game mechanics ('points, badges and leaderboards'), which is focused on external motivation. Showed that gamification is quite a challenging technology; when it is used, priority attention should be given to maintaining the balance between its utilitarian (educational) and hedonic (recreational) functions. In gamification, as distinct from any games (real and digital), entertainment is a method rather than a purpose; forgetting this obvious fact is fraught with negative consequences. It is concluded that gamification should never be seen as a universal remedy. © 2020 LLC Ecological Help.

In fact, gamification has attracted considerable controversy (“gamification is bullshit”) and some derogatory labels such as “exploitationware.” Therefore, in order to make the case for or against gamification in education, it is important to examine the effects (if any) of gamification on student learning achievements. This study is a meta-analysis of 30 independent interventions (3,202 participants) drawn from 24 quantitative studies that have examined the effects of gamification on student academic performance in various educational settings. The results show an overall significant medium effect size in favor of gamification over learning without gamification (Hedges' g = 0.504, 95% CI [0.284–0.723], p < 0.001). No publication bias is detected. An analysis of 32 qualitative studies reveals four reasons for learners' enjoyment of gamification: (a) gamification can foster enthusiasm; (b) gamification can provide feedback on performance; (c) gamification can fulfill learners’ needs for recognition; and (d) gamification can promote goal setting, and two reasons for their dislike of gamification: (a) gamification does not bring additional utility and (b) gamification can cause anxiety or jealousy. We conclude by highlighting two unresolved questions, and suggesting several future research directions concerning gamification in educational contexts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd";"";"";"English";"Review";"";"Scopus"

The two most relevant game approaches are “serious games” (games with a serious background) and “gamification” (the application of game-typical elements in nongame contexts). The term serious games is used to describe games that are used to convey serious content, such as health issues. Gamification uses game-design elements such as points, leaderboards, awards, profile design, and team events to increase motivation and performance, for example in learning environments. This narrative article examines the mode of action and study situation as well as the advantages and disadvantages of playful applications in prevention and health promotion and exemplifies some of these applications. Serious games and gamification show great potential in prevention and health promotion. Especially in the case of target groups that are difficult to reach and disinterested, a direct connection to their living environment can be established.

This methodology has recently revealed itself as one of the most efficient teaching methodologies in the student body, proving useful at all educational levels. One of the most frequently mentioned properties is its ability to ""reset"" the student's attention clock: the key is collective learning, an attractive way of remembering new content. The experience described below has been developed in the context of a generalist university in two very different degrees: Degree in Teacher Training and Degree in Computer Engineering. To develop the theoretical sessions, the master class was combined with the use of the Kahoot tool. The observations made by the teachers in relation to the dynamics of the theoretical classes show that the use of Kahoot at the end of the theoretical sessions increased the students' attendance at class, in addition to their involvement in the sessions and they kept their attention for longer. This study has also shown that there are significant differences in the level of satisfaction shown by the students of both degrees with these tools. © 2020 by the authors.";"Gamification; Higher education; Information and communication technologies (ICT); Kahoot®; Sustainable education";"comparative study; computer simulation; education; student; teacher training; university sector";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold";"Scopus"

In total, 127 students participated in the study, divided into a gamified experimental group (n = 62) and a control group (n = 65). The participants completed a questionnaire to assess motivation in physical education before and after the intervention and performed a final exam to assess academic performance. The results indicated an increase in external regulation in the experimental group only. Furthermore, this group achieved significantly better academic performance. The findings of this study suggest that gamified implementation is beneficial for academic performance at the university stage, even though intrinsic motivation does not change.

Among these reviews, the most common theme examined was learning outcomes (89%), followed by affective elements (45%), behaviours (25%), technological elements (21%) and teaching/pedagogical aspects (19%). Most of the reviews found that the use of technology improved learning outcomes and affective perceptions. Approaches involving interaction, gamification, constructivism, student-centred learning and feedback were most effective.

A mixed methods approach was used with quantitative (i.e., tests and an optional assignment) and qualitative (i.e., student interviews) methods applied. The test results indicate that students in the flipped class (n = 28) significantly outperformed those in the traditional (n = 27) and online independent study (n = 21) classes. In addition, flipped learning with gamification promoted students’ cognitive engagement better than the other two approaches. The findings of student interviews suggest that peer interactions inside the flipped classroom were critical to promoting students’ mathematics achievement and cognitive engagement, as opposed to online learning resources and gamification per se.

Our gamification approach was based on the self-determination theory. According to this theory, people need to have competence, social connectedness, and autonomy in order to feel determined to perform certain activities. We aimed to investigate the effects of teaching presence in online gamification on sustainability learning and self-determination as well as identify the driving factors and barriers to sustaining students' participation in online gamified activity. A mobile application called JouleBug was used. It contains game elements and aims to encourage pro-environmental behaviours. Our quasi-experimental design included two university courses (as control and treatment groups) on sustainable education with 48 participants. Both groups worked with JouleBug, whereas the treatment group was also supported by their teacher's teaching presence. To establish online teaching presence, the teacher shares the students' leader board rankings, acknowledges the students' achievements, and give comments and feedback on students' activities in the chatting group twice a week. Sustainability knowledge and pro-environmental behaviour were measured through survey. Students' performance in the gamified activities was measured through collected points in the JouleBug application. The drivers and barriers to sustaining the students' participation in JouleBug activities were identified through focus group interviews and students' reflection writing. We found there were significant differences in the sustainability knowledge, pro-environmental behaviour, and performance between the treatment and control groups. The Cohen's d effect size value obtained for the treatment on sustainability knowledge, pro-environmental behaviour, and students' performance indicates a large effect as well. Focus group interviews with the participants and the students' reflection writings revealed that the driving factors in sustaining the participation in the gamified activities in the application are recognition by teachers and peers, competition, and sense of belonging to a group. Meanwhile, the barriers to sustaining participation in online gamification are time constraints, boredom caused by lack of social interaction, and boredom caused by activity repetition and activity's inappropriate level of difficulty. The conclusion is the teacher plays a role as an agent in this online gamification learning context. The findings suggest that teaching presence is one of the important building blocks that encourage the students' participation and learning in online gamification. © 2020 by the authors.";"Environmental education; Gamification; Higher education; Mobile apps; Online learning; Self-determination theory";"autonomy; education; experimental design; knowledge; learning; local participation; recognition; self determination; sustainability; teaching";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold";"Scopus"

The game integrates Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) technology without markers to create a geolocation scenario with unlimited physical space. The results indicate that both game modes are intrinsically satisfactory for children triggering positive emotions such as enthusiasm, enjoyment and curiosity that improve the participants’ mood and help increase the degree of involvement. Moreover, we observed that the collaborative game version has a greater impact on emotional affection, social interaction and interest.

EPCs are traditionally visualized as 2D graphs and their size varies with the complexity of the process. While process modeling experts are used to interpreting complex 2D EPCs, in certain scenarios such as, for example, professional training or education, also novice users inexperienced in interpreting 2D EPC data are facing the challenge of learning and understanding complex process models. To communicate process knowledge in an effective yet motivating and interesting way, we propose a novel virtual reality (VR) interface for non-expert users. Our proposed system turns the exploration of arbitrarily complex EPCs into an interactive and multi-sensory VR experience. It automatically generates a virtual 3D environment from a process model and lets users explore processes through a combination of natural walking and teleportation. Our immersive interface leverages basic gamification in the form of a logical walkthrough mode to motivate users to interact with the virtual process. The generated user experience is entirely novel in the field of immersive data exploration and supported by a combination of visual, auditory, vibrotactile and passive haptic feedback. In a user study with N = 27 novice users, we evaluate the effect of our proposed system on process model understandability and user experience, while comparing it to a traditional 2D interface on a tablet device. The results indicate a tradeoff between efficiency and user interest as assessed by the UEQ novelty subscale, while no significant decrease in model understanding performance was found using the proposed VR interface. Our investigation highlights the potential of multi-sensory VR for less time-critical professional application domains, such as employee training, communication, education, and related scenarios focusing on user interest. © 2020 IEEE.";"business process models; immersion; immersive data analysis; multi-sensory feedback; passive haptics; Virtual reality";"Data structures; Haptic interfaces; Industry; Personnel training; Professional aspects; Sensory analysis; Sensory feedback; Three dimensional displays; Virtual reality; Business process model; Haptics; immersion; Immersive; Multi-sensory feedback; Solid model; Two-dimensional displays; User experience; adult; algorithm; computer graphics; computer interface; exploratory behavior; female; human; male; physiology; task performance; virtual reality; walking; young adult; Adult; Algorithms; Computer Graphics; Exploratory Behavior; Female; Humans; Male; Task Performance and Analysis; User-Computer Interface; Virtual Reality; Walking; Young Adult";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Due to such benefits, the use of gamification is also proposed in education environments to improve students' performance, engagement, and satisfaction. Computer science in higher education is a tough area of study and thus needs to utilize various already explored benefits of gamification. This research develops an empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in teaching computer science in higher education. Along with the learning outcomes, the effect of group size on students' satisfaction level is also measured. Furthermore, the impact of gamification over time is analyzed throughout a semester to observe its effectiveness as a long-term learning technique. The analysis, covering both learning outcome and students' satisfaction, suggests that gamification is an effective tool to teach tough courses at higher education level; however, group size should be taken into account for optimal classroom size and better learning experience. © 2020 ACM.";"Computer science education; gamification; group size; higher education studies; longitudinal effect";"Education computing; Gamification; Effective tool; Empirical studies; Game elements; Higher education; Learning experiences; Learning outcome; Long-term learning; Students' satisfaction; Students";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Bronze";"Scopus"

One of the most popular games in recent years is the Escape Room, but the study of its use in education and with health professionals is still limited. The aim of this study was to find out the perceptions and experiences of final year nursing students in an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) by means of an Escape Room. Methods: In January 2019, 9 focus groups (FG) were held, with a total of 95 final year nursing students. We applied a qualitative content analysis approach and ATLAS.ti version 8 was used for data analysis. Results: The data revealed 3 main themes and 8 sub-themes. The three main themes, which were mapped to the conceptual framework, were student learning outcomes, emotional impact on students and conclusions on the serious games experience. Both the main themes and the sub-themes were illustrated using representative quotes from the participants. Conclusions: These results can help to apply these methodologies, such as the Escape Room, alongside other pre-existing ones, complementing the way in which students are assessed and the development of important nursing skills, such as teamwork and communication. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.";"";"adult; article; clinical examination; conceptual framework; content analysis; controlled study; data analysis; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; nursing competence; nursing student; perception; qualitative research; teamwork";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Green";"Scopus"

Even though many studies have been conducted to investigate the efficacy of the integration of gamification to different education curriculums, few studies have examined the reactions, behaviors, and attitudes of learners toward the use of gamification in medical education. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the medical students' learning experience and acceptance of the use of gamification for the delivery of electrocardiogram lessons. Materials and Methods: A qualitative research method was used to generate findings in this study. The data collection methods included focus group discussions and interviews. Triangulation methods were used to ensure the validity and reliability of the qualitative data analyzed in this study. The thematic analysis of the data collected in this study helped to garner insights into the perception of participants and experts about the use of GaMed@™ for the delivery of ECG lessons. Results: A total number of 32 medical students and four experts in the fields of user experience, communication, social psychology, and game design participated in this study. The findings showed that in spite of the negative reports about the user experience and application of GaMed@™, the participants and experts affirmed its positive impact on the increased motivation and engagement of users. Conclusions: The impact of this concept can be maximized by tailoring the game design to foster-positive learning attributes, behaviors, and outcomes in students.

Current literature has focused on finding ways to afford the playfulness and gamefulness of gamification. This paper has studied college students’ perceptions of pleasure in learning to explore the underlying aspects of enjoyment in their learning experiences. Based upon the playful experiences (PLEX) design framework (Arrasvuori et al., 2011), we distributed an online survey to 235 college students and used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to find four underlying aspects of pleasurable learning experiences among the participants: instruction (Cronbach’s a =.84), instructors’ teaching styles (Cronbach’s a =.87), learning effectiveness (Cronbach’s a =.71), and collaboration (Cronbach’s a =.71). This scale can be used for gamification designers to identify the key game design elements for their target learners. We have also examined the effects of gender, majors, computer skills, and gaming habits on participants’ preferences for pleasure in learning. Majors resulted in statistically significant differences among the participants’ attitudes towards collaboration (F(6, 212) = 5.84, p <.001, Eta-square =.14).

More so, the purpose of the study aims to use the GT through LS in teaching probability courses to Senior High School (SHS) students. Specifically, the paper aims to document the use of GT in teaching simple and compound probability of events and to develop integrative gamification using manipulatives in teaching probability. A qualitative case study was adopted in which a team was created to conduct an LS. Results revealed that the use of gamification was perceived to be effective in teaching probability to SHS students. Also, manipulatives were utilized in which students’ performances were graded based on the rules in each activity and according to the scoring rubric. Notwithstanding, the use of manipulative in each activity was effective in engaging learners in the teaching-learning process and in gaining an understanding of probability. Surprisingly, the use of probing questions was then recommended by the experts in the LS since they saw a more meaningful discussion in it. It was recommended to integrate the lesson to real-life experiences of the students aside from using typical examples found in the book. A positive note highlighted is its ability to foster cooperation and care for others among students. Notable observations can be linked to the qualities of the teacher in the effective facilitation of gamification. Now, what makes the LS essential is that it teaches the entire educators to be keen on emphasizing the objectives after implementing game-based activities that it is not about winning or gaining points but learning to cooperate and helping one another. © 2020, IJSTR.";"Games-based Strategy and Gamification Technique; Lesson Study; Mathematics Education; Philippines; Probability; Whole Brain Teaching";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Besides their many advantages, smartphones might pave the way to compulsive usage and addictive experiences. To remedy this problem, this study proposes an authentic approach which integrates consumer behavior theories and techniques such as unhook and gamification. An education program has been designed based on these approaches to decrease the problematic smartphone use. Method: The participants of the education program consisted of 305 students (48.2% girls and 51.8% boys) with a mean age of 14.57 (SD = 0.74). The Demographic Form and Smartphone Addiction Scale for Adolescents (SASA) were conducted before the education program and three weeks after the education. Results: The results of the paired sample t-test analysis before and after the education program revealed that the SASA total scores decreased significantly (p < 0.01). There are significant differences in terms of gender, mothers’ education and class levels. Conclusion: This research emphasizes the role of an interdisciplinary approach to the addiction problem. The content used in the education program includes strategies that originally aimed at increasing consumption.

Didactic research should evaluate the effectiveness of educational methods to know if they are applicable, useful, and in what sense. Exergames are digital motor games that aim to stimulate players' motor skills. Gamification refers to the use of game-based elements in nongame contexts to motivate actions. This research evaluates a gamified exergaming intervention, designed to improve children's academic performance by focusing on understanding applicability and usefulness. A natural experiment was set up in schools according to a mixed methods design. The qualitative data herein reported were collected during a natural experiment with a nonrandomized controlled design. The qualitative research design was used with field notes, an open-questions questionnaire, individual semi-structured interviews and focus group interviews. Eight teachers and 417 students took part. A content analysis was chosen as the methodological orientation. The facilitators were the realism of their didactic design and their adaptability to different educational contexts. The main barriers were the required materials and facilities. Teachers and students' attitudes were very positive, although future use was inconclusive. These findings may imply that this study is one of the few to provide positive evidence for educational gamification. The “Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics” gamification model and the “Just Dance Now” exergame may be applicable and useful for didactics in Physical Education, but all the participants' suggestions need to be considered to improve teaching interventions.

The present project, which is a collaboration between design and education, lays the foundation for an educational endeavor based on an idea of environmental citizenship. By creating environmental citizen tokens for children and youths, this project aims to change learned living patterns and encourage a new generation to work toward a sustainable climate. There is also good possibility that the young people's involvement and striving for a better environment will transfer to adults.

Adequate use of this equipment is more critical than ever because the risk of shortages must be balanced against the need to effectively protect health care workers, including prehospital personnel. Specific training is therefore necessary; however, the need for social distancing has markedly disrupted the delivery of continuing education courses. Electronic learning (e-learning) may provide significant advantages because it requires neither the physical presence of learners nor the repetitive use of equipment for demonstration. Objective: Inclusion of game mechanics, or “gamification,” has been shown to increase knowledge and skill acquisition. The objective of this research was to develop a gamified e-learning module to interactively deliver concepts and information regarding the correct choice and handling of PPE. Methods: The SERES framework was used to define and describe the development process, including scientific and design foundations. After we defined the target audience and learning objectives by interviewing the stakeholders, we searched the scientific literature to establish relevant theoretical bases. The learning contents were validated by infection control and prehospital experts. Learning mechanics were then determined according to the learning objectives, and the content that could benefit from the inclusion of game mechanics was identified. Results: The literature search resulted in the selection and inclusion of 12 articles. In addition to gamification, pretesting, feedback, avoiding content skipping, and demonstrations using embedded videos were used as learning mechanics. Gamification was used to enhance the interactivity of the PPE donning and doffing sequences, which presented the greatest learning challenges. The module was developed with Articulate Storyline 3 to ensure that it would be compatible with a wide array of devices, as this software generates HTML5-compatible output that can be accessed on smartphones, tablets, and regular computers as long as a recent browser is available. Conclusions: A gamified e-learning module designed to promote better knowledge and understanding of PPE use among prehospital health care workers was created by following the SERES framework. The impact of this module should now be assessed by means of a randomized controlled trial. © 2020 JMIR Publications.

They also agreed that Quizizz is able to provide a platform which promotes positive reinforcement, motivation and immediate feedback when their marks are being displayed on the leaderboard. It is hoped that these findings could encourage educators to integrate Quizizz as a form of formative assessment more effectively. © IJSTR 2020.";"Distance learners; Motivation; Online games; Post graduate students";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

We describe here AntibioGame®, a serious game for improving the training of medical students in antibiotic use in primary care. Objective: We aimed to design a serious game for antibiotics teaching and to evaluate its usability and playability by medical students. Methods: We used various gamification techniques (e.g. use of mascots, avatars, rewards, leader board) and cartoon graphics in the design of AntibioGame®. This game implements clinical case templates built from a list of learning goals defined by a medical team through an analysis of clinical practice guidelines. The game was evaluated by asking medical students to rate their satisfaction and the usability and playability of the game on an electronic form and through group discussions. The electronic form was derived from the MEEGA + scale, a five-point Likert scale including 32 items for assessing both usability and playability. Results: AntibioGame® is a case-based game in which students play the role of a doctor meeting patients in consultation and helping other health professionals to solve their problems, as in real life. The scenarios are realistic and cover situations frequently encountered in primary care. The 57 medical students enrolled found the game attractive, usable, fun, and appropriate for learning. Game quality was considered “good” (score = 60 on the MEEGA + scale). All the students said they would recommend the game, 96 % liked it and 81 % would use it for revision. Conclusion: AntibioGame® is a promising tool for improving knowledge in antibiotic prescription that could easily be included in multifaceted programs for training medical students. © 2020 The Authors";"Antibiotics; E-learning; Education; Infectious diseases; Primary care; Serious games";"Antibiotics; E-learning; Education; Students; Antimicrobial resistances; Clinical practice guidelines; Electronic forms; Group discussions; Health professionals; Infectious disease; Multi-faceted programs; Primary care; Serious games; antiinfective agent; adult; clinical decision making; disease management; education; female; general practice; human; learning; male; medical education; medical student; primary health care; procedures; psychology; teaching; video game; young adult; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Clinical Decision-Making; Disease Management; Education, Medical; Female; General Practice; Humans; Learning; Male; Primary Health Care; Students, Medical; Teaching; Video Games; Young Adult";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green";"Scopus"

We applied a two-tiered motivational, online gamified learning system over 2 years to a total number of 333 students. In a mixed methods research design, we used 3-year worth of longitudinal data (333 students for the treatment group and 175 in the control group) to assess students' engagement and performance in that period. Quantitative results established that students engaged and performed better in the gamified condition vis-à-vis the nongamified. Furthermore, students exhibited higher levels of engagement in the second year compared with the first year of the gamified condition. Our qualitative data suggest that students in the second year of the gamified delivery exhibited sustained engagement, overcoming the novelty effect. Thus, our main contribution is in suggesting ways of making the engagement meaningful and useful for the students, thus sustaining their engagement with computer-based gamified learning systems and overcoming the novelty effect. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd";"computer-based learning system; gamification; meaningful; novelty effect; student engagement; student performance";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Serious games are effective and innovative digital tools for educating patients about positive health behaviors. There are limited systematic reviews that examine the prevalence of serious games that incorporate medication use. Objective: This systematic review aimed to identify (1) serious games intended to educate patients about medication adherence, education, and safety; (2) types of theoretical frameworks used to develop serious games for medication use; and (3) sampling frames for evaluating serious games on medication use. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for literature about medication-based serious games for patients. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed for article selection. Results: Using PRISMA guidelines, 953 publications and 749 unique titles were identified from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. A total of 16 studies featuring 12 unique serious games were included with components of medication adherence, education, and safety, published from 2003 to 2019. Of the 12 games included, eight serious games were tested in adolescents, three games were tested in young adults, and one game was tested in adults. Most studies (n=11) used small sample sizes to test the usability of serious games. Theoretical frameworks identified in the 12 serious games included information, motivation, and behavior theory; social cognitive theory; precede-proceed model; middle-range theory of chronic illness; adult learning theory; experiential learning theory; and the theory of reasoned action. Existing reviews explore serious games focused on the management of specific disease states, such as HIV, diabetes, and asthma, and on the positive impact of serious game education in each respective disease state. Although other reviews target broad topics such as health care gamification and serious games to educate health care workers, no reviews focus solely on medication use. Serious games were mainly focused on improving adherence, whereas medication safety was not widely explored. Little is known about the efficacy and usability of medication-focused serious games often because of small and nonrepresentative sample sizes, which limit the generalizability of existing studies. Conclusions: Limited studies exist on serious games for health that incorporate medication use. The findings from these studies focus on developing and testing serious games that teach patients about medication use and safety. Many of these studies do not apply a theoretical framework in the design and assessment of these games. In the future, serious game effectiveness could be improved by increasing study sample size and diversity of study participants, so that the results are generalizable to broader populations. Serious games should describe the extent of theoretical framework incorporated into game design and evaluate success by testing the player’s retention of learning objectives. © Olufunmilola Abraham.";"Games; Medication adherence; Patient safety; Systematic review; Video games";"";"English";"Review";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

The interface is designed to appeal to Pacific people, a population group with a higher risk of developing clinically significant behavioral problems than most other ethnic groups in New Zealand. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the opinions of parents and professionals about the acceptability, usability, and content of Play Kindly. Methods: We used qualitative and Pacific and Māori research methodologies. A total of five focus groups with 45 parents and 12 individual interviews with professionals were conducted. The five focus groups consisted of 2 pan-Pacific groups, 1 Māori group, 1 open group, and 1 group of young Pacific adults or prospective parents. The professionals were from a range of disciplines, and the majority had expertise in early childhood, parenting interventions, or research in this field. Results: Play Kindly appealed to both parents and professionals. Participants related to the scenarios, which were created in collaboration with a playwright and animator. Although most participants liked the Pacific feel, there was some disagreement about how culturally specific the app should be. A range of issues with usability and gamification techniques were highlighted, likely attributed to the low budget and lack of initial co-design with parents as well as professionals with specific expertise in parenting. A number of parents and professionals felt that the parenting strategies were overly simplified and did not take into account the context in which the behavior occurred. Professionals suggested narrowing the focus of the app to deliver two important parenting messages: playing with your child and positively reinforcing desired behaviors. Conclusions: Play Kindly is the first culturally adapted parenting app of its kind designed for Pacific parents and other New Zealanders with children 2-5 years of age. This app has potential in Pacific communities where there are limited culturally specific parenting resources.

Food waste interventions included a passive approach (handouts), a community engagement approach, and a gamification approach. We conducted waste audits, household surveys (pre-and post-intervention), and a focus group at the end of the campaign. The passive and gamification groups had similarly high levels of participation, while participation in the community group was very low.

Programming is a challenging and highly important topic for introducing learners to our digital world. Research has shown that motivation plays a key role in programming performance. Gamification using digital badges has the potential to influence motivation, provide social recognition and encourage learner participation. More research is recommended to evaluate its motivational impact in different contexts. Intervention. This research explores the effects of badges on the intrinsic motivation levels of introductory programming students within a higher education institution. The course is offered during the first year of the programme. We report the results of a baseline study without badges and four subsequent badge experiments of different designs over a four-year period. Methods. This quasi-experimental study followed a pre-test/post-test design to measure the effects of badges on the intrinsic motivation levels of university-level introductory programming students. Badges were designed and implemented. Feedback via focus groups and a post-badge survey was collected. Results. Findings are inconclusive as the quantitative results suggest that badges did not increase intrinsic motivation scores. Contrastingly, badge survey and qualitative data indicate that badges were received more positively on average. Discussion. We analyse and discuss the results within the context of motivation and the programming discipline, and discuss external factors that may impact the relationship between gamification and motivation. Conclusion. Further research is necessary to investigate whether gamification, through the use of digital badges, can foster positive intrinsic motivational results, particularly in the well-known challenging domain of introductory programming. © The Author(s) 2019.";"digital badges; gamification; higher education; intrinsic motivation; introductory programming";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Termed massive open online courses (MOOCs), these soon fell into different categories, depending on their concept. Among them are connectivist massive open online courses (cMOOCs) which emphasise a collaborative approach to learning. However, while initial enrolment is indeed massive, completion rates are very low and cMOOCs notoriously lack an appropriate method of evaluating learning progress and motivational resources. The author of this article suggests that one way of addressing this problem might be to adapt motivational formative assessment tools used in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) to cMOOCs. He argues that some characteristics of MMORPGs can be effectively incorporated in cMOOCs, thus benefiting from the motivational potential of MMORPGs. He cautions, however, that even if MMORPGs (and ongoing, low-stakes formative assessment in general) are motivational, they can only be applied to cMOOCs if the idea of formative assessment is not in tension with connectivist principles.

Location-based games (geogames) have been established following mainly a ‘seek-and-find’ game-mechanic, challenging mechanics like simulations are rarely used. We describe an approach for creating an educational location-based game (geogame). The central design problem consists in integrating an ecological simulation into the location-based game flow. We show how to combine these two game mechanics by simplifying complex simulations while maintaining their validity. In an empirical study we evaluate our geogame with secondary school students (N = 329). Our quasi-experimental pre-post-test design focuses on the game-related enjoyment provided by a simplified simulation task within a geogame compared to a more complex desktop simulation and to a geogame without simulation. The results show that the players of the Geogame spend much less time on interacting with the simulation than on other tasks. Nevertheless, the simulation within the geogame contributes positively to the game playing experience. Player enjoyment is even found to be slightly higher in the simulation geogame than in the indoor simulation. A critical threshold of time for using simulations within location-based game mechanics is discussed and related design-pattern for geogames are presented to support educators and game developers in the co-design of challenging location-based games. This study contributes to locate ecological simulations in areas where they actually take place.

To succeed, players must collaborate and think critically and creatively. Our objectives were to provide a novel team-building activity, teach interesting content about radiology as a specialty, cultivate grit, and share the game with other programs. Materials and Methods: Escape Rooms were held during orientation (BOOT Camp) for incoming radiology residents and for upper level residents and faculty with advanced content (four teams totaling 20 residents and faculty). We repeated the Escape Room 27 times for 144 residents from more than 10 countries at Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) 2018. Results: Players were engaged and competitive. They were able to connect the activity to their future responsibilities – analyzing knowledge under pressure (being on call), communicating effectively (conveying results and recommendations), having the dexterity and motor skills required for physical puzzles (hand-on procedures), being able to multi-task and come up with differential diagnoses under extreme stress and time pressure (being on call). A post-RSNA survey confirmed satisfaction with the activity, with overall enjoyment receiving the highest rating. Conclusion: It is feasible to create a portable, inexpensive Escape Room as a novel educational platform for radiology residents. Combining knowledge-based challenges and technical skills in a live-action game simulated a real-life situation in which vital patient information must be collected and reported concisely and accurately.

Methods: Seventy-four primary education teachers and their 2069 students were randomly assigned to three groups. The first group of teachers (n = 23) were trained to use a face-to-face method. The objective of the training was that the teachers would be able to implement EI into their teaching to improve academic achievement in their students (n = 645) using face-to-face instruction. For the second group (n = 28), the teachers were trained to use an e-learning gamification method. Similar to the first group, the objective of the training was that the teachers would be able to implement EI into their teaching to improve academic achievement in their students (n = 758) using e-learning gamification instruction. The third group of teachers (n = 23) served as the controls and did not receive any special training, nor did they implement EI into their teaching (n = 666). Results: Implementation of EI into classroom teaching effectively improved academic achievement in primary school students using both methods. However, there was a greater increase in academic achievement and higher teacher satisfaction in the game-based e-learning group. No significant differences in student achievement were observed in the control group. Conclusion: Emotional intelligence as a key academic competency. © Copyright © 2020 Pozo-Rico and Sandoval.";"academic achievement; emotional intelligence; methodology and didactics; primary school; satisfaction; teacher continued training";"";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

This study aims to apply gamification to website design for facilitating effective communication. Two experimental websites, including a gamification incorporated website and a no-gamification incorporated website, are constructed. Users are recruited to use individual websites. After the website experience, task questions, system usability scale, online questionnaire and retrospective thinking aloud are applied to collect user feedback. The data analyses reveal that ‘gamification incorporated website’ could not promote the usability of websites, while learnability, pleasure, engagement and satisfaction are enhanced. Overall speaking, applying gamification to websites could actually enhance communication efficiency.

However, theoretical underpinnings of the proposed effects of gamification are lacking. This paper applies the theory of gamified learning and extends research exploring the benefits of gamification on student learning through the testing effect. In a quasi-experimental design, university students (N = 473) prepared for three tests using traditional quizzes (i.e., a question, four response options) or gamified online quizzes (i.e., a wager option, a progress bar, encouraging messages). We assumed that students completing gamified quizzes would complete more quizzes and, through the benefits of the testing effect, would demonstrate better learning. Findings supported the testing effect in that students who completed more quizzes performed better on subsequent tests. Furthermore, students who completed the gamified quizzes had significantly better scores on the first test. However, this effect was not due to students completing more quizzes in the gamification group. Additionally, the beneficial effect of gamification did not persist for subsequent tests. This supports that gamification might work through a novelty effect where its influence may not be sustainable. Further analyses showed that higher achieving students benefited more from gamification than lower achieving students. Overall, the results (a) imply that gamification may be a viable option for short-term assignments, (b) highlight concerns of a novelty effect possibly recommending instructors not to use the same gamification method permanently, and (c) indicate that there are contexts where gamification might not be adequate to target low achieving students. Given these results we call for longitudinal studies investigating the novelty effects of gamification and research examining individual differences moderating the effects of gamification. © 2019";"Adult learning; Distance education and telelearning; Improving classroom teaching; Media in education";"Distance education; Adult learning; Distance education and tele-learning; Educational settings; Improving classroom teaching; Individual Differences; Low-achieving students; Media in education; University students; Students";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

The TAM is enhanced with other factors; such as the task technology fit (TTF) and social motivation. The TTF is used to examine gamification utility, while social motivation is used to examine social influence (SI) and social recognition (SR). Data were collected in two phases, in the first phase 375 data were used for the TAM, secondly, 31 data were used for the pre and posttest. A structural equation model were presented to test the TAM while the t-Test were used to study the knowledge gain from using the gamification system. However, the foundation for understanding instructors' behavior in this study's context are: (1) perceived usefulness and attitudes are crucial to the continuance intentions to use gamified Moodle for training; (2) perceived usefulness mediates the relationships among social recognition, TTF, perceived ease of use, and social influence on continuance intentions; (3) when predicting continuance intentions, TTF, social recognition, social influence, and perceived ease of use are vital; (4) TTF positively affects perceived ease of use; and, unexpectedly, (5) the TTF and social influence have no significant effects on perceived usefulness.

It has a serious impact on the child's personality, upbringing, education, socialization, development, and academic success from the preschool period to the university and beyond. In general, traditional teaching methods usually have a fixed learning structure which disables the child to be motivated, creative and innovative. Learners receive theoretical rather than practical instructions, which discourage them from keeping and recalling concepts and information more quickly. Moreover, traditional teaching usually lacks attracting the full attention of learners which decreases their interaction, engagement and investment in the content. Thus, the development of innovative approaches offering better education is an effective way to address this problem. On the other hand, recent researches in the fields of cognitive science and educational neuroscience show that play-based learning is a promising approach to use in early childhood education. Four key success factors for learning have been identified to strengthen children's skills, namely attention, active engagement, feedback, and consolidation. Thus, the proposed approach presents a digital play-based learning approach deploying serious games augmenting the pedagogical aspect of the Montessori approach. Our purpose is to improve children's skills in their early years education through play-based learning and gamification. It aims to provide children with a rich variety of serious gaming activities and challenging experiences in an interactive environment. We developed several serious games based on Montessori pedagogical principal and the four pillars of learning.

Game-based learning environments are designed to teach specific knowledge content and skill-based learning outcomes using game elements. One main reason for using game-based learning environments is to increase student motivation and engagement while teaching learning outcomes. Many of the game-based learning environments are designed so that students will reach maximum flow, which is defined as students being so completely immersed in that game that they do not notice that they are learning. These learning environments have been shown to improve many behaviour and cognitive learning outcomes. While game-based learning has many benefits, some educational researchers have indicated that it is often very costly to develop a complex game-based assessment to teach a few learning outcomes. Hence, in some cases it is more beneficial to approach the use of computer games in education using gamification.

The management of tuberculosis education through the DOTS program is performed in clinics and hospitals only to patients and their families. The purpose of this study is to describe the development and testing of a prototype (social-game education) for interactive education for tuberculosis patients in particular and the general public. The data collection process is through direct observation of tuberculosis patients and health professionals (doctors, nurses, and DOTS health workers). Challenge the game in the prototype was provided with content that contained tuberculosis information that had been previously validated by a specialist. In addition to tuberculosis information as the main content, two important elements are making up this prototype, which are gamification and social media elements. In the game elements, this study adopted elements of the leaderboard, badge/achievement, challenge, and level. As for the third element, social media includes likes, comments, and shares. Prototype application testing was conducted on two participant groups (N = 48) consisting of 23 tuberculosis patients and 25 random participants. By using the user experience questionnaire (UEQ) technique, this research focuses on identifying the user's motivation in capturing compositional information as well as the clarity of the prototype. With a confidence interval of 5% (p = 0.05) per scale. The results indicate that participants have a high level of motivation towards the prototype; this is seen in the rating scale of stimulation with an average of 1.578. Likewise the effectiveness level of information in the rating scale of perspicuity has a mean of 1.224 also has a rate that is quite effective. © 2020, Science and Information Organization.";"Education; Gamification; Mobile application; Social-media; Tuberculosis";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

In the educational sector, this technique seems to be very promising to support and retain engagement with learners. However, while the volume of gaming elements on learning activities has increased, it is perhaps surprising that very little is known about its implementation in takaful (i.e, Islamic insurance) education. Building on recent papers on effectively gamifying a concept, this paper develops a game-based activity in understanding and creating awareness on takaful. Using the five-step process to develop gamification, this paper attempts to fill the gap by proposing a game-based activity using wordoku and other interesting elements to enhance learners' cognitive, behavioral and psychological aspects. Inspired by the Japanese mathematics puzzle Sudoku, wordoku uses letters instead of numbers to solve the puzzles. In this game, students need to complete all the five interactive parts which include completing wordoku, construction of a short-based story-line, drawing of a concrete shape poem using Jawi letters, sharing information using an online platform and finally creating a new wordoku. Aimed to be a built-in instructor, this game helps students to understand takaful and its role in Islamic economics. While it is acknowledged that further improvement is required, this study provides a basis for adopting gamification in takaful lessons. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt. Ltd.

Two separate mixed-method studies reveal insights about serious games in higher education and where innovations may be leveraged. Traditional statistics were used to analyze quantitative data, and coding was used to analyze the qualitative data. The results from a global survey of ten PMI-accredited university programs suggest that serious games are embryonic but promising.

Hence, this study explored the feasibility of providing direct vocabulary instruction with gamification through an intervention programme which the researcher named the Accelerated Vocabulary Acquisition (AVA) programme as a method to improve tertiary students’ academic vocabulary. Marzano’s three-phase framework for vocabulary instruction was adapted and gamification was incorporated through the use of the gaming platform Kahoot!. This study used a quantitative approach and adopted the non-randomized control group, pretest-posttest design. The participants were 180 tertiary students studying for their diploma in various fields. The academic section of the Vocabulary Levels Test (VLT) by Schmitt et al. was used to measure the students’ academic vocabulary.

Student disengagement is reported as the main problem for higher education e-learning platforms. E-learning developers employ Gamification to counteract this issue. A plethora of game elements are used in the gamification of e-learning. On the other hand, there are various learning activities used in e-learning platforms. Based on a literature-based analysis, this study thus identifies several game elements suitable for inclusion in learning activities in e-learning platforms to improve student engagement. This identified the most commonly used game elements, and a subsequent questionnaire survey examined real user perspectives on these elements. As a result, a conceptual engagement framework outlining how game elements might be used to support e-learning activities to engage students is proposed. The framework is intended to be used as a guideline for developers and academics seeking to build engaging e-learning systems based on good foundational concepts. The paper thus presents a short review of existing e-learning gamification frameworks and the steps taken towards the identification of commonly used game elements.

It is aligned with student-centered ideologies and is primarily based on increasing student engagement and motivation. At the same time however, exam oriented, teacher-centered classes continue to dominate many Asian countries. The reasons for this lag are undoubtedly varied, but almost certainly include culturally defined expectations regarding teacher-student roles, as well as issues related to large classes, among others. This paper reports on a project aiming to gamify large General English classes in provincial China, both as a way to engage students and develop teachers. Although the use of games is common, few studies explore the use of games as a central component of classes, and there is scarce information regarding the use of games in the Chinese context. Thus, both the logistical and attitudinal issues involved in the introduction of gamified classes are addressed. The findings indicate that the project was generally met with positive reactions by students and teachers, but that refinements, greater adaptation to prevailing conditions, and better preparation are needed to more effectively gamify classes.

However, the benefit and implementation of such gaming platforms are not clearly studied. This analysis assesses the feasibility of Kahoot! regarding simplicity and low-cost performance as a learning/teaching tool for medical education in (histo-)pathology. Materials and Methods: In this feasibility pilot study, we developed 36 modules for different benign and malignant tumors, covering four major topics: gastrointestinal tract, dermatology, urogenital tract, and hematology. Each module included histomorphological text-based questions for education of 2nd-year medical students. The online gaming-platform Kahoot! was anonymously implemented before and after “classical” medical education which included discussions of histological slides for each tumor entity using Microsoft PowerPoint-based presentations in combination with microscopical demonstrations. Participating students were invited to a seven-questions evaluation about the online educational approach. Results: Overall, 23 of 51 students of the study class completed the pre-and the post-evaluation of Kahoot! in one or more organ systems. The percentage of correct answers increased from the initial mean/median of 47.2/45% to 77.2/76.3%. Simultaneously, the time for answering questions decreased by roughly 50% (from mean/median time of 9.1/8.3 seconds to 5.1/4.3 seconds) from pre-to post-assessment. The results were independent of gender; however, there were scoring differences between the different organ systems. Students positively evaluated the routine implementation of the gaming-platform Kahoot! within medical education. Conclusion: Kahoot! is as a simple, direct, and low-cost application in medical teaching improving learning outcomes of pathomorphological topics with high acceptance by students.

This raises to surface what many studies have addressed earlier; creating a platform that completes the traditional classroom work and maximizes the effectiveness of learning outcomes. Striving to achieve such platform, studies have considered gamifying and personalizing the educational resources for the adaptation of educational systems as per the intended learners through intensive learning analytics. But was the learner really a part of the adaptation process taking place? Learning analytics are usually designed to the course’s adaptation and solely for the teachers. Thus, learning analytics in gamified adaptive educational systems involving the course, teachers and learners together are still under investigation. In this study, the Personalized Adaptive Gamified E-learning (PAGE) model is introduced to extend MOOCs by providing new satisfactory levels of learning analytics and visualization in the rich e-learning process that supports the learner’s intervention in the resultant learning analytics. The proposed Learning analytics have been developed to make the necessary adaptation to the course and learner’s learning flow, as well as visualizing the process and adaptation decisions to the learners. Results show a positive potential towards learning adaptation and visualization, and a necessity to provide an additional focus for the gamification concept. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

To get the benefits of information technology advances in teaching and learning process at schools; we need to find a technology that is easy for the teacher to use and fun for the students to learn it. Kahoot! is a form of technology in the Student Response System (SRS) with a gamification approach that can increase student involvement in the classroom. This study aims to look at the students' perceptions of Kahoot! And see the effect on non-cognitive aspects, namely Likeness and Interesting, and cognitive aspects, namely Achievement. As many as 153 students were involved in this study consisting of 127 students in the experimental class and 26 students in the control class. We implemented Kahoot! in chemistry lessons for three months in the innovative class then surveyed to see their perceptions. We also compare the academic score of a chemistry lesson from both courses before and after the implementation. More than 90% of the students perceived Kahoot! as easy, fun and engaging, and 83.75% of respondents felt more positive towards the topic. The results show that Kahoot! has a positive effect on student perceptions and non-cognitive aspects, but the application of Kahoot! has no direct impact on the cognitive elements observed, namely Achievement. © 2020 Kassel University Press GmbH.

The purpose of this study is to validate an electronic learning, or e-learning, concept featuring gamification elements, rapid case reading, and instant feedback. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. An e-learning concept was devised that offered game levels for the purpose of providing training in the detection of pneumothorax in 195 cases, with questions read in rapid succession and instant feedback provided for each case. The user's task was to locate the pneumothorax on chest radiographs and indicate its presence by clicking a mouse. The game level design included an entry test consisting of 15 cases, training levels with increasing difficulty that involved 150 cases, and a final test that including 30 cases (the 15 cases from the entry test plus 15 new cases). A total of 126 candidates were invited via e-mail to participate and were asked to complete a survey before and after playing the game, which is known as RapRad. The level of diagnostic confidence and the error rate before and after playing the game were compared using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS. Fifty-nine of 126 participants (47%) responded to the first survey and finished the game. Of these 59 participants, 29 (49%) responded to the second survey after completing the game. Diagnostic confidence in pneumothorax detection improved significantly, from a mean (± SD) score of 4.3 ± 2.1 on the entry test to a final score of 7.3 ± 2.1 (p < 0.01) after playing RapRad, with the score measured on a 10-point scale, with 10 denoting the highest possible score. Of the participants, 93% indicated that they would use the game for learning purposes again, and 87% indicated that they had fun using RapRad (7% had a neutral response and 6% had a negative response). The error rate (i.e., the number of failed attempts to answer a question correctly) significantly decreased from 39% for the entry test to 22% for the final test (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION. Our e-learning concept is capable of improving diagnostic confidence, reducing error rates in training pneumothorax detection, and offering fun in interaction with the platform. © 2020 American Roentgen Ray Society.";"Education; Feedback; Medical; Pneumothorax; Radiography; Software";"adult; Article; clinical competence; constructive feedback; controlled study; e-mail; electronic learning; game; human; learning; medical education; medical student; pneumothorax; priority journal; radiological technologist; radiology; resident; thorax radiography; adolescent; computer interface; diagnostic error; diagnostic imaging; education; feedback system; female; male; medical education; middle aged; prevention and control; procedures; radiology; Switzerland; thorax radiography; video game; Adolescent; Adult; Diagnostic Errors; Education, Medical; Educational Measurement; Feedback; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumothorax; Radiography, Thoracic; Radiology; Switzerland; User-Computer Interface; Video Games";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

A Teaching Innovation Project (TIP) seeks to provide a solution to the problems raised with new methods of teaching inside and outside the classroom and greater interaction between the students and the professor. This way, geometry is no longer something abstract, unrelated to the professional practice of thearchitect. Thereby, it is intended to structure a new subject that provides students not only with graphic and spatial techniques but also with teamwork, cooperation, training, sufficiency and autonomy resources that help them in the development of their future career. In order to carry out this new methodology for teaching, a course based on gamification has been designed, which allows the students to focus on the subject from a more playful point of view with the aim of motivating and involving them. Based on a three-year experience of comparative work between the traditional and the proposed systems, the conclusions obtained with regards to the withdrawal rate, academic performance and perception of the teaching method are presented in this paper.

Platforms such as Kahoot!, accompanied by the student's smartphone, allow the teacher to create a classroom response system (CRS) a fast and straightforward way. The present study, with a non-experimental design, is developed to assess the use of this tool in higher education, both in a face-to-face format and through a virtual learning environment. After applying an electronic questionnaire (20 items; α=.958) to a sample of 148 students (94 in the face-to-face mode and 54 in the virtual mode) whose teachers had used Kahoot! with the same methodological planning, a high degree of predisposition for their employment as future teaching professionals and positive perception of the resource is detected, especially when assessing their potential for self-assessment of the learning process and assimilation of the basic concepts of the subject. Likewise, after the Mann-Whitney U test, it was found that students in the virtual mode showed a higher score than those in the face-to-face mode. It concludes by stressing the importance of teachers using technological resources such as Kahoot to promote innovative methodologies for the benefit of quality higher education. Besides, as a consequence of the previous studies, it is considered that the discrepancies found are due to a more positive evaluation in the training modality where the use of this type of resources is more innovative. © 2020 Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca.

Faced with persistent physical symptoms and debilitating social consequences, patients follow complex treatment regimens and often have difficulty adhering to them. Purpose: In this manuscript, we review factors which contribute to low adherence rates and advance potential single-and multi-factor-based interventions. It is hoped that these observa-tions can lead to improvements in managed care of this vulnerable population of patients. Methods: A narrative review of the primary literature was performed on contributing factors with primary focus on the period 2015–2020 using available databases and search engines. Adherence pain points identified were mapped against a series of potential solutions which are presented. Results: Enhancement of treatment adherence relies on two approaches viz. single-factor and multi-factor solutions. Single factors identified include electronic reminders, enhanced health education, financial incentives, gamification strategies, community drivers, persona-based modeling, and burden relief of poly pharmacy. Multi-factor solutions combine two or more of the seven approaches offering the potential for flexible interventions tailored to the individual. Discussion and Conclusion: Heart failure patients with poor adherence have increased mortality, hospitalization needs, and healthcare costs. This review highlights current single-factor and multi-factor adherence methods. Against a backdrop of diversity of approaches, multi-factor solutions cast the widest net for positively influencing adherent behaviors. A key enabler lies in the development and leveraging of patient personas in the synthesis of successful intervention methods. Deployable solutions can also be envisioned in clinical trials where adherence tracking represents an essential component. © 2020 Makris et al.";"Cardiac disease; Connected health; Heart failure; Intervention; Treatment adherence";"clinical decision making; community support; cooperation; family relation; financial management; follow up; game; gamification; health behavior; health care cost; health education; heart failure; hospitalization; human; human relation; incentive; interpersonal communication; medical literature; mobile application; Morisky Medication Adherence Scale; mortality; observational study; patient care; patient to family interaction; patient to patient interaction; peer group; personalized medicine; polypharmacy; professional-patient relationship; Review; self care; social support; text messaging; wireless communication";"English";"Review";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

However, unlike our study, some studies are not validated and verified by healthcare professionals. Additionally, this study intends to promote the interaction between the teenagers and the medical communities. In this study, we analyze the benefits of the proposed mobile application, which features monitoring of physical activity, daily tips and curiosities, questionnaires, and gamification through earning points. Most of the teenagers were satisfied with the physical activity monitoring and found the tips, curiosities, and weekly questionnaires useful. The study started with 26 teenagers from two schools in the center of Portugal that would use the mobile application for five weeks. Still, at the end of the study, only 7 teenagers finalized the study. The decreasing number of teenagers in the study was affected by the lack of social interaction caused by the pandemic situation. During the period, the mobile application would engage the users with notifications on nutrition and physical activity, challenges concerning the number of steps and calories they would have to spend, and questionnaires related to the curiosities and suggestions from the previous week. We used Fisher’s test to investigate the relationship between the assessment obtained in the responses to the questionnaires, and the adoption of healthier eating and sports practices. In summary, participants were satisfied with the mobile application and experienced some improvements in diet and habits. © 2020 by the authors.";"Education; Health; Mobile application; Nutrition; Physical activity; Teenagers";"";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

This means that this knowledge has been acquired fast and superficially. Thus, discernment turns into something ephemeral, because there is not a profound examination of the aspects dealt with. This is caused by the enormous quantity of information found that, in many cases, does not reflect reality. In this sense, teachers can find multitasking students that can perform many activities but without reflexively undertaking them. Education tries to solve these type of problems so the learning-teaching process is as significant as possible. Therefore, future teachers should always have tools for keeping students’ attention, as well as to raise interest in the studied subjects. Within these new tools, escape rooms are, because they not only increase students’ motivation but also encourage teamwork and reflexive learning, as the tasks to be solved are complex. However, as male and female present different perspectives towards gamification, in this work, escape rooms have been studied applying a gender perspective. In the University of Seville, Spain, a descriptive-interpretative exploratory study took place intending to analyse future female teachers’ conceptions about escape rooms. A 17-item questionnaire was applied to 99 female students of the Degree in Primary Education. Results show that subjects highly valued the ludic part of the escape rooms as a didactic activity, which fosters significant learning. Students also appreciated that the activity was close to their reality and that it was integrating students’ interests in the Primary Education classroom. The main conclusion of the study is that, even if there is room for improvement and there is a need to make them more appealing to female students, escape rooms are considered an excellent educative resource as well as an adequate alternative teaching methodology. © 2020, University of Wollongong.

The second part will focus on existing research on gaming pedagogy and the gaming elements of a phonetics app developed by the Resource Centre for Ubiquitous Learning and Integrated Pedagogy (ULIP) at Hong Kong Baptist University. The gamified pedagogical element of the app is designed to offer levels of challenge that motivate the players by making learning more exciting and rewarding. The game-based elements of the app not only support active student engagement but are specifically designed to offer challenges and goals for players. Moreover, the need to capture and maintain the players’ attention through visual experiences and audio designs is also an important element in the design of the app. When learners are engaged in a game-based app of this nature, they are not only reinforcing their cognitive skills, but they are also constantly drawing connections between images, text and sounds, thereby allowing students to learn and practise basic skills in order to master complex tasks. © Centre for Language Studies National University of Singapore.";"";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Following a design science research (DSR) method, we created a gamified, “choose your own adventure” style security education, training, and awareness (SETA) artefact using two formats: text and visual. Both artefacts were designed to identify the security threats that trainees are most susceptible to, debrief them about the threat and its potential consequences, and facilitate behaviour change by letting trainees re-evaluate their decisions. Using a longitudinal randomised controlled experiment, we compared these two artefacts to no intervention and traditional security warning emails by assessing both instrumental (changes in attitudes, intentions, and OSD behaviour) and experiential (memorability and user experience) outcomes. Our survey of 1,718 employees showed that the text-based artefact was better at improving instrumental outcomes, and the visual-based artefact was better at improving experiential outcomes.

The way in which preservice science teachers prepare to practice one's profession, approach to some concepts, events or phenomena can be determined effectively through metaphors. This research’s aim is to determine the approaches of preservice science teachers about physics that they have difficulty in understanding and physics problem solving that they have difficulty in solving through metaphors. The participants of the research are comprised of 139 students who are studying in different classes in the science teacher education program at the Faculty of Education at a university in the Eastern Black Sea Region. In the pattern of phenomenology, the data were collected through a questionnaire and have been subjected to content analysis by NVivo 11 program. Generated metaphors are generally grouped under the headings nature, benefits and needs. It has been found that the codes often emphasize the link between physics and daily life, difficulty, combining different kinds of knowledge and skills, and relation with logic. Some of the results reached are those: Even though preservice teachers associate physics and physics problems with life, they remember the solution process of routine physics problems when they face with a physics problem. They have difficulties in understanding physics and solving physics problems, and think that solving physics problems probably depends on combining information in a related way. Related to these results, suggestions such as giving different types of problems in physics lessons, gamification the physics teaching, adding a lesson about physics problem solving strategies have been offered. © 2020, Hacettepe University.

Therefore, games have been widely studied in many non-game contexts. Education is one of those areas where gamified, and game-based learning strategies have been implemented and explored. To engage and motivate students to quiz each other, and as a side effect, build a question bank, as well as to study the gaming and learning behavior of students, we used a peer-quizzing game called “Tower of Questions” (ToQ). The game uses some themes and mechanics found in tower defense (TD) games. The students received points for posing and answering the questions in the game in the form of gems. Students played the game with pseudonyms for one academic term and were told not to disclose their identities to anyone. We conducted a 3-month long study for two consecutive years in the same first-year undergraduate computer science course. In this paper, we present the findings from our studies using ToQ, specifically findings related to the students’ self-monitoring and quizzing activities based on the game logs and two self-reported surveys from data collected in the second year ofthe study. © ACPIL.";"Engagement; Game-based testing; Gamification; Incentives; Peer-quizzing";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

While there was a soaring increase in the number of enrollments for this stage of schooling, there was also a decline in the institutionality of the school and an intensification of a certain grammar of the pedagogical crisis. Driven by constant educational reforms, a strong political investment in High School is observed focusing both on teacher's training and on the production of school curricula adjusted to the new demands of 21st century society. Therefore, this text analytically considers the relationships established between the school curriculum and the recent policies and practices for teacher's training for High School implemented in the Brazilian context. Based on curricular studies and traditions of contemporary social theory, especially on recent writings by Gilles Lipovestsky, three scenes of initial teacher's training that took place in courses in southern Brazil, developed by public and private Higher Education Institutions, will be examined. Such experiences seem to show a decline in academic legitimacy in the recent training models in favor of a centrality of practices, a gamification of procedures and the fading of curricular knowledge and its public function. © 2020, Emerson de Pietri.";"Brazil; Curriculum; High school; Teacher's training";"";"Portuguese";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

The first step of the study was used to develop and validate an efficient measure of students' perceptions of their DL skills. Step 2 was employed to check the research hypotheses by a quasi-experiment interventional study design. To this end, data were gathered from two groups: research and control (which has not experienced the intervention), both groups were Education students. Participants’ perceived DL skills and creative self-concept (CSC) were surveyed twice – before (pretest) and after (posttest) a three-month intervention. Lastly, qualitative data were collected and analyzed (Step 3) to better understand the quantitative data results. Results revealed significant differences between the pre/post tests only for the research group on the DL and CSC factors – the scores at the posttest were higher than the pretest. Non-significant differences were indicated between the tests for the control group. Results also indicated significant low to moderate connections between the DL and CSC factors.

Collective intelligence could potentially decrease the error rates of nonexperts. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and impact of collective intelligence for the detection of skin cancer. Methods: We created a gamified study platform on a stack of established Web technologies and presented 4216 dermatoscopic images of the most common benign and malignant pigmented skin lesions to 1245 human raters with different levels of experience. Raters were recruited via scientific meetings, mailing lists, and social media posts. Education was self-declared, and domain-specific experience was tested by screening tests. In the target test, the readers had to assign 30 dermatoscopic images to 1 of the 7 disease categories. The readers could repeat the test with different lesions at their own discretion. Collective human intelligence was achieved by sampling answers from multiple readers. The disease category with most votes was regarded as the collective vote per image. Results: We collected 111,019 single ratings, with a mean of 25.2 (SD 18.5) ratings per image. As single raters, nonexperts achieved a lower mean accuracy (58.6%) than experts (68.4%; mean difference=-9.4%; 95% CI -10.74% to -8.1%; P<.001). Collectives of nonexperts achieved higher accuracies than single raters, and the improvement increased with the size of the collective. A collective of 4 nonexperts surpassed single nonexperts in accuracy by 6.3% (95% CI 6.1% to 6.6%; P<.001). The accuracy of a collective of 8 nonexperts was 9.7% higher (95% CI 9.5% to 10.29%; P<.001) than that of single nonexperts, an improvement similar to single experts (P=.73). The sensitivity for malignant images increased for nonexperts (66.3% to 77.6%) and experts (64.6% to 79.4%) for answers given faster than the intrarater mean. Conclusions: A high number of raters can be attracted by elements of gamification and Web-based marketing via mailing lists and social media. Nonexperts increase their accuracy to expert level when acting as a collective, and faster answers correspond to higher accuracy. This information could be useful in a teledermatology setting. © 2020 Christoph Rinner, Harald Kittler, Cliff Rosendahl, Philipp Tschandl.";"Basal cell carcinoma; Crowdsourcing; Dermatoscopy; Diagnosis; Experimental; Games; Melanoma; Nevi; Skin cancer; Skin pigmentation";"actinic keratosis; Article; artificial intelligence; basal cell carcinoma; cancer diagnosis; dermatofibroma; dermatologist; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; epiluminescence microscopy; feasibility study; female; game; human; Internet; male; melanoma; nevus; predictive value; screening test; sensitivity and specificity; simulation; skin cancer; social media; vascular lesion; genetics; intelligence; pathology; procedures; skin tumor; telemedicine; Female; Humans; Intelligence; Internet; Male; Skin Neoplasms; Telemedicine";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

One of the main elements is the lack of motivation of the students before the learning that they must carry out in class. Active methodologies are presented as an alternative for students to actively build their learning, with the teacher's guidance. Among the active methodologies is gamification, which is presented as a methodology using techniques and structures of the game in non-recreational contexts, to provoke and build learning. This research aims to define and contrast an explanatory model about the personal dimensions that become part of the students with the use of this methodology such as the student's mastery, enjoyment, the absence of negative effect and absorption with respect to creative student thinking. The instrument used is the GAMEX questionnaire, translated and validated by the authors of this manuscript for this context, as a previous investigation to the current one. The results obtained show that there is a positive relationship between all dimensions, that is, the student's mastery, their enjoyment, the absence of a negative effect and the student's absorption with the student's creative thinking. There is also a relationship between the dimensions absence of negative effect and dominance with the enjoyment of the students and between the dominance and the enjoyment of the students with their absorption in learning through gamified experiences. © 2020 Red Universitaria de Campus Virtuales.

Problems of social and environmental nature, requirements for providing high-quality support for online education have revealed new conditions for implementation, difficulties and prospects for learning at a distance. The authors suggest using game technologies for managing information interaction in the classroom to support motivation, activate cognition, involve students in collaborative work, and control attendance. Method of research. Theoretical and methodological analysis and generalization of fundamental scientific works on the research problem, processing of the results of control measures and the content of the ClassDojo service (forms, thank-you letters, stickers, posters) are used. The authors took into account the provisions of the system-activity, personality-oriented and communicative approaches. The pedagogical experiment involved 48 students (75% of girls and 25% of boys) from the ""Lyceum of Natural Sciences"", Kirov. The G-signs criterion was used as a statistical processing method. Results. The features of online learning based on game technologies for managing information interaction through the ClassDojo service are formulated: the content of the educational material is focused on the peculiarities of perception of the modern schoolchild, the inclusion of mobile services activates cognitive interest, supports research and communication practice, intensifies the process of mutual assistance in the group. The empirical value of Gemp=3 less than Gcr=8 (for p=0.01) confirms that the shift towards improving the quality of educational results after using the ClassDojo game service is not accidental. Conclusion. The inclusion of game technologies to support class management in online-learning will help improve the quality of educational results while providing a set of conditions: activation of knowledge, connecting students to information interaction in new ways, expanding the classroom beyond the school walls, changing the roles of participants in the didactic process, the use of mobile applications. © 2020 LLC Ecological Help.

The goal of the study is to conduct an experiment on the implementation of a flexible mobile application for studying the “macroeconomics” by students of economic specialties and to compare the results obtained with the selected control group. A total of 20 sophomores (10 each from two universities: Sechenov University, Department of Economics and Management; and Azerbaijan State Economic University, Department of Economic Theory) were offered to study the course in macroeconomics using a mobile application during the semester (from September to December 2019). Students were selected from two universities for the scientific objectivity and from the second year of the bachelor‘s degree, since “macroeconomics” is studied in the early courses, regardless of the further, specific economic direction of the student. Students did not attend lectures and practical classes with a teacher; all training was performed with the help of an application. A control group of the same specialty and year (also 20 people) was selected to confirm or contradict the effectiveness of such a mobile application. The control group students studied “macroeconomics” in the traditional way, namely attending lectures and practical classes with a teacher, during this semester. As a result of the experiment, the study group students liked training with the application. Meanwhile, 70% of the students would not like to have such training for all disciplines, permanently. But students supported studying using a special mobile app as a supplement to the main format of teaching. During the final examination, held by the traditional method (a written exam -answers to 4 open questions and 10 multiple choice questions), the following results were obtained. Students, who were using m-learning, on average, got higher results by 0.2 points, according to the overall assessment, a 5-grade scale, and separately according to the test results more by 2 correct answers than students with the traditional education. Thus, this can be explained since students using mobile app practiced material in a form of game or case, which helped them to immerse themselves more in the problem and to assimilate the material. The results were compared with the research of other scientists. © 2020.

This study investigates whether the use of ERPsim games can be extended to other management disciplines. More specifically, this study reports on using the ERPsim games innovatively in a new context, in an undergraduate managerial decision making course, to enhance student perceived learning outcomes and satisfaction. Background In this study, the ERPsim games were used to provide students with practical experience about using information in tactical and operational decision mak-ing and to illustrate important course concepts such as anchoring, bias, and bounded awareness, among others. The theoretical framework leveraged in this study was derived from the literature on technology acceptance in educa-tional settings and the studies on virtual learning environment effectiveness. Methodology Survey methodology was used to collect the data and test the research model. One sample t-tests and partial least squares (PLS) were used for empirical analysis. 138 students participated in the study. Contribution By developing and testing a sound research model, we conclude that the use of ERPsim games can be successfully extended from their current domain of Information Systems to management courses that are not technical to en-hance student understanding of managerial concepts in a fun and enjoyable way while enabling students to gain realistic practical experience in using in-formation for decision making. While, the ERPsim games have been used in IS education; this paper presents an opportunity to use them in a different context. Findings The study confirms that the ERPsim games are useful in improving student perceived learning outcomes and the level of satisfaction in management courses. It also identifies the factors that directly or indirectly shape student learning outcomes and satisfaction in such courses. Recommendations for Practitioners The use of the simulations has relevance to the new Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) guidelines that emphasize the need to incorporate evidence based, technology and data-driven decision making to solve real-world business problems into business curriculum. The study should also encourage educators to innovate in their own courses by experi-menting with this particular simulation or similar simulations. Recommendations for Researchers Researchers should use additional samples to increase the generalizability of the findings. They should also extend the current research model by incorpo-rating additional factors. Impact on Society The study provides support for the use of a simulation game to improve stu-dents' learning experiences and to help them better understand managerial decision making, which would allow graduates to more effectively transition into managerial roles. Future Research Future research should include establishing and validating the best practices surrounding the use of these simulations in the classroom. © 2020 Informing Science Institute.";"Curriculum innovation; ERPsim; Gamification; Management decision making; Simulation";"";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Bronze";"Scopus"

Demonstrating the rationale and mechanics of reporting may improve this. Methods: We designed and implemented an escape room patient safety simulation to incorporate active learning, gamification, and adult learning theory into intern patient safety onboarding. Interns from all sponsoring institution programs participated, identifying, mitigating, and reporting a range of patient safety hazards. Props and faculty time were the major resources required. Results: One hundred twenty interns participated in this simulation in June 2018. Forty-one percent reported previous training on reporting errors, and only 5% had previously entered an event report. Average confidence in ability to identify patient safety hazards improved after the simulation from 6.35 to 8.00 on a 10-point rating scale. The simulation was rated as relevant or highly relevant to practice by 96% of interns. Discussion: Several factors contribute to a low error-reporting rate among house staff. We developed a simulation modeled on popular escape room activities to increase awareness of safety hazards and ensure familiarity with the actual online reporting system our interns will use in the clinical environment.

From education to work to shopping, our activities are tracked, our progress is monitored, and rewards are meted out. But this enforced acceptance of constant surveillance constructs a social narrative in which privacy ceases to exist, and the technological tools at work can easily be shifted from reward to control. This is furthered through the shift from a Bentham–Foucault model of power and the threat of surveillance to the actualisation of complete protocological surveillance enabled by cloud computing, data centres, and machine learning. It is no longer the case that anything we do might be surveilled; we can be fairly certain that everything we do probably is being monitored, judged, and recorded. How can we negotiate these changing narratives? Of what fictions do we convince ourselves when we play the “game” called digital society? This article uses the work of Cory Doctorow, Charles Stross, Dave Eggers, and Ernest Cline to assess how fictionality can act as thought experiments for the social conditions of surveillance technologies. Through stories such as Halting State and Walkaway, we explore the collisions between the control-based society of tech companies and the disciplinary structures of traditional states—the points of tension between illusions of freedom, guided game paths, and the exercise of power over users’ data and behaviours. The article argues for expanding our perspectives on the reach of game analysis to the broader connected networks of cultural and political systems, to assess ways of responding to the idea that we are being played with, turned into characters in the gamified narratives of control-based surveillance societies. © The author(s), 2019.";"";"";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold";"Scopus"

These systems can deliver high-level multisensory learning experiences that are important in the teaching of many subjects, especially those involving abstract concepts or requiring spatial skills, such as organic chemistry. Haptic experiences with VR, however, remain a challenge. In addition, development has focused on general entertainment/gaming; VR systems in chemistry implement simulations of the chemistry laboratory and other advanced systems whereas those that support safe, game-like, immersive and multisensory learning of organic chemistry with haptics at pre-university education levels are scarce. We developed the VR Multisensory Classroom (VRMC) as an immersive learning environment within a VR head-mounted display, where learners employ hand movements to build hydrocarbon molecules and experience haptic feedback through gloves with built-in sensors and hand-tracking with the Leap Motion system. We report here the evaluation of the first prototype by learners from diverse backgrounds who reported on the ability of the VRMC to support high engagement, motivation, interest and organic chemistry learning as well as diverse learning styles.

Many complications can arise if diabetes is poorly managed. Hence, the need for adequate knowledge, skills, and ability to care for oneself, known as diabetes self-care management, is needed to reduce complication rates. We used an interactive platform that incorporates principles of gamification to enhance user engagement to enhance diabetes knowledge. The purpose of this descriptive pilot study was to discover what adult patients with diabetes thought about this novel educational approach to diabetes education. Materials and Methods: We collected focus group data from participants at a diabetes clinic after they played an interactive diabetes trivia game, on our software platform (Kaizen Education). Transcripts were coded and common themes were identified. Results: We conducted 9 focus groups that included 33 adult (age >18) participants who had diabetes. An overarching theme of play/gaming as a form of learning was apparent, and after analyzing the coding several themes emerged, including preferences and desired environments (clinic and home) for learning, desired players (including family, significant others), and a good balance of question difficulty. Conclusions: Participants were overwhelmingly positive about gamified education and felt empowered to lead discussions with their health care providers about diabetes self-care education, in a sense ""flipping"" the traditional clinic patient education paradigm.

Hence, ArkaeVision represents a user-centric integrated system able to offer different modalities of exploitation of Cultural Heritage assets, including virtual representations of monuments, works of art and objects, as well as the stories associated to them. ArkaeVision therefore introduces a new communication paradigm, made of game-alike exploration of a 3D environment, virtually reconstructed, with elements of digital fiction and an engaging stortytelling, applied to two case studies: the exploration of the Hera II Temple of Paestum with Virtual Reality (VR) technology, and the exploration of the slab of the Swimmer Tomb with Augmented Reality (AR). The emotional component is fundamental in ArkaeVision, because it generates the motivation and leads people to use immersive viewers, as the HTC Vive, which allow the learning process to be activated more quickly, as many cognitivists and psychologists reported in the latest researches. Also the involvement of users through gamification is well expressed in ArkaeVision. This model of action (and interaction) designed for the public allows to emphasize the role of users through a system that is “guided” by their choices and times, in order to increase users’ engagement within the virtual exploration, and favour the content understanding by direct experience. Evaluations conducted on a preliminary prototype suggested that the communicative approach is very promising for education and engagement into cultural heritage experiences. © 2019";"Augmented reality; Digital storytelling; Gamification; User experience design; Virtual reality";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

The purpose of this paper is to determine its potential in libraries to meet the needs of both users and librarians. The specific goals include: description of the main features of wearable computing from the perspective of its potential usefulness in libraries; analysis of areas of wearable computing use in public institutions; discussion of the potential of wearable computing for library users; and discussion of the potential of wearable computing for librarians to determine its potential in libraries to meet the needs of users and librarians. Design/methodology/approach: The method of subject literature overview was used. The state of research from the period 2008 to 2018 on the use of wearable computing in libraries was established based on a search of selected sources Web of Science, Scopus, Elsevier and Emerald databases and LISTA database. Findings: Wearable computing can be used in many areas of library activities to serve the needs of users and librarians. In the context of services for users, wearable computing can be used, among others, to help users navigate the library, to provide resources in new and interesting forms, and in education and entertainment. For the needs of librarians, additional data provided via wearable devices can accelerate the process of cataloguing resources and increase motivation to work via gamification options and features that make it possible to measure personal work efficiency. Librarians can also use the data obtained wearable computing devices to more quickly track, identify, select and organize resources. As with users, librarians can also use wearable computing in their education. Research limitations/implications: The paper is a viewpoint based on subject literature. It presents only a sketch of potential wearable computing applications in libraries. The aim of the paper is to initiate further discussion on the possibilities of using wearable devices to improve both services for users and internal library processes. The author’s hope is that the concepts presented here will be tested in practice by librarians, which will allow further development of research on this subject. Practical implications: The results can be widely used in practice as a framework for the implementation of wearable computing solutions in libraries. Social implications: The paper can help to facilitate the debate on the role of the implementation of new technologies in libraries. Originality/value: The issue of the use of wearable computing has not yet been widely discussed in library and information science journals. In the very few publications on similar topics, only the perspective on the application of new solutions in services for users is presented.

Many studies show improvements with respect to traditional methodologies. Several educational strategies have also been combined with Gamification with interesting results. Interest is growing and evidence suggest Gamification has a promising future. However, there is a barrier preventing many researchers from properly understanding Gamification principles. Gamification focuses of engaging trainees in learning with same intensity that games engage players on playing. But only some very well designed games achieve this level of engagement. Designing truly entertaining games is a difficult task with a great artistic component. Although some studies have tried to clarify how Game Design produces fun, there is no scientific consensus. Well established knowledge on Game Design resides in sets of rules of thumb and good practices, based on empirical experience. Game industry professionals acquire this experience through practice. Most educators and researchers often overlook the need for such experience to successfully design Gamification. And so, many research papers focus on single game-elements like points, present non-gaming activities like questionnaires, design non-engaging activities or fail to comprehend the underlying principles on why their designs do not yield expected results. This work presents a rubric for educators and researchers to start working in Gamification without previous experience in Game Design. This rubric decomposes the continuous space of Game Design into a set of ten discrete characteristics. It is aimed at diminishing the entry barrier and helping to acquire initial experience with Game Design fundamentals. The main proposed uses are twofold: To analyse existing games or gamified activities gaining a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses and to help in the design or improvement of activities. Focus is on Game Design characteristics rather than game elements, similarly to professional game designers.

Most of them focus on Education, making use of Gamification to increase the motivation of a learning process. The gamification mechanics and elements most used were Badges/Achievements and Points/ExperiencePoints(XP), and most of the studies were not validated, thus not providing empirical evidence of the impact of gamification. Conclusions: Existing research in the field is somehow preliminary, and more research effort to analyse the applicability of the models and their respective evaluations would be needed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.";"gamification; models; motivational characteristics; Systematic mapping";"Models; Motivation; Gamification; Learning process; motivational characteristics; Research efforts; State of the art; Systematic mapping; Systematic mapping studies; Mapping; achievement; article; education; human; human experiment; learning; mechanics; motivation";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

The goal of this study was to evaluate gamification methodology as compared with other existing methodologies when teaching cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to secondary school students. Methods 489 secondary school students from two high schools in Spain participated in this randomised-block quasi-experimental study in February 2018. The students were classified into different groups. Each group received CPR training with a different methodology: GAM (gamification-based training as a compulsory but non-tested academic activity to learn by playing in teams, with instructor and visual feedback); EVA (training based on subsequent evaluation as a motivational incentive, with instructor and visual feedback); VFC (visual feedback complementary, training based on a non-compulsory and non-tested academic activity, with instructor and visual feedback); TC (traditional complementary, training based on a non-compulsory and non-tested academic activity, with instructor feedback). After a week, each student performed a 2 min hands-only CPR test and quality of CPR was assessed. Visual feedback in training and CPR variables in test were provided by the QCPR Instructor App using a Little Anne manikin, both from Laerdal (Norway). Results GAM (89.56%; 95% CI 86.71 to 92.42) methodology resulted in significantly higher scores for CPR quality than VFC and TC (81.96%; 95% CI 78.04% to 85.88% and 64.11%; 95% CI 58.23 to 69.99). GAM (61.77%; 95% CI 56.09 to 67.45) methodology also resulted in significantly higher scores for correct rate than VFC and TC (48.41%; 95% CI 41.15% to 55.67% and 17.28%; 95% CI 10.94 to 23.62). 93.4% of GAM methodology participants obtained >50 mm of compression mean depth which was a significantly higher proportion than among students in VFC and TC (78.0% and 71.9%). No differences between GAM and EVA were found. A confidence level of 95% has been assigned to all values. Conclusions GAM methodology resulted in higher CPR quality than non-tested methods of academic training with instructor feedback or visual feedback. Gamification should be considered as an alternative teaching method for Basic Life Support (BLS) in younger individuals. © 2019 Author(s).";"CPR; feedback; gamification; secondary school education; teenagers";"adolescent; Article; child; constructive feedback; controlled study; education; female; gamification; health education; high school; high school student; human; intermethod comparison; male; mobile application; motivation; priority journal; quality control; quasi experimental study; resuscitation; simulation training; Spain; teaching; visual feedback; manikin; nonparametric test; procedures; psychology; recreational game; resuscitation; simulation training; student; Adolescent; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Child; Female; Games, Recreational; Humans; Male; Manikins; Simulation Training; Spain; Statistics, Nonparametric; Students; Teaching";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Nine third-through sixth-grade classrooms (n = 292 students) in one elementary-middle school in Detroit, Michigan (49% female, 95% nonwhite; 80% qualified for free/reduced lunch) participated in this 20-week intervention where teachers implemented 5 × 4 min moderate-to-vigorous activity breaks per day. Gamification of activity breaks occurred during weeks 13–20 of the intervention and included the use of game design elements and classroom goals for activity break intensity. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during activity breaks was measured via direct observation. There was a significant effect of intervention with a 27% increase in student MVPA participation during the gamified intervention weeks compared with the standard intervention weeks (p = 0.03). Gamification of activity breaks resulted in 55% (compared with 25% during the standard intervention) of students accumulating approximately 20 min of health-enhancing physical activity per day in their classroom.

There are multiple risk factors that together create an increased risk for children in traffic, some of the major reasons include children’s inability to efficiently and actively scan the environment and look for information relevant to the traffic environment, inconsistent behavior, and less developed hazard perception skills. Traffic safety education is one of the most important means for improving knowledge and skills required for children to behave safely in traffic. This study evaluated a newly developed and gamified e-learning platform meant to promote traffic safety among elementary school pupils in Belgium. Participants in this study were from four grades of elementary school and voluntarily took part in the training. They followed a self-study program at home for approximately 15 min per week over a period of 5 weeks in total. The platform included four modules: traffic knowledge, situation awareness, risk detection, and risk management. For each of these modules, a set of photos and videos were used as stimuli and selected from a database of camera recordings of real-life situations. Half of each module consisted of familiar situations for the pupils (i.e., own municipality), while the other half of each module consisted of unfamiliar situations for the pupils (i.e., other municipalities). A fifth module, “the finale,” contained a mix of the first four modules. In total, 44 elementary school pupils (9–13 years old) completed the program. During the first round of measurement (i.e., the first four modules), pupils performed significantly better in the traffic knowledge module when compared with the other three modules. Further, in comparison with unfamiliar situations, pupils scored significantly higher in familiar situations. During the second round of measurement (i.e., the fifth module), pupils achieved higher scores in the risk detection and risk management modules when contrasted to the first measurement. The effect of gamification elements is discussed and the results also indicate the type of traffic safety issues to be emphasized in traffic safety education for children. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.";"Children; E-learning; Education; Evaluation; Gamification; Traffic";"Accident prevention; E-learning; Education; Risk management; Risk perception; Telecommunication traffic; Children; E-learning platforms; Evaluation; Gamification; Hazard perceptions; Road traffic injuries; Situation awareness; Traffic environment; Risk assessment";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Green";"Scopus"

The literature reviewed showed a lack of design principles applied to the development of serious games for children with ADHD and more particularly to learn mathematics. More and more in our context we have to consider alternative solutions including the use of technology in response to the special needs of this sector of the population. Our serious game was designed to meet thirteen children diagnosed with ADHD, six special education teachers, parents, as well as specialists in the care of the ADHD. The work that has been done with them consists of semi-structured interviews, observation by class intervals, a Wizard of Oz experiment and a CSUQ e to measure system usability, information quality, interface quality and overall user satisfaction. In this paper, we present the results, although not conclusive, are encouraging, as they show a high percentage of agreement between users' satisfaction and the serious game tested. At the same time, children and teachers showed motivation and enthusiasm in the use of these types of resources to promote children's learning, especially those diagnosed with ADDH.

However, many of them consider it difficult. Furthermore, many find these topics less appealing and not connected to their future specialization in different fields of clinical medicine. Student-centred strategies such as problem-based learning, gamification and the use of real data can increase the appeal of a difficult topic such as genetic testing, a field at the crossroads of genetics, molecular biology and bioinformatics. Methods: We designed an electronic teaching application which students registered in the undergraduate Medical Biology course can access online. A study was carried out to assess the influence of implementation of the new method. We performed pretest/posttest evaluation and analyzed the results using the sign test with median values. We also collected students' personal comments. Results: The newly developed interactive application simulates the process of molecular genetic diagnostics of a hereditary disorder in a family. Thirteen tasks guide students through clinical and laboratory steps needed to reach the final diagnosis. Genetics and genomics are fields strongly dependent on electronic databases and computer-based data analysis tools. The tasks employ publicly available internet bioinformatic resources used routinely in medical genetics departments worldwide. Authenticity is assured by the use of modified and de-identified clinical and laboratory data from real families analyzed in our previous research projects. Each task contains links to databases and data processing tools needed to solve the task, and an answer box. If the entered answer is correct, the system allows the user to proceed to the next task. The solving of consecutive tasks arranged into a single narrative resembles a computer game, making the concept appealing. There was a statistically significant improvement of knowledge and skills after the practical class, and most comments on the application were positive. A demo version is available at https://medbio.lf2.cuni.cz/demo-m/. Full version is available on request from the authors. Conclusions: Our concept proved to be appealing to the students and effective in teaching medical molecular genetics. It can be modified for training in the use of electronic information resources in other medical specialties. © 2019 The Author(s).";"Bioinformatics; E-learning; Gamification; Genomics; Interactive teaching application; Medical databases; Medical genetics; Problem-based learning";"biology; computer interface; education; genetic disorder; genetic screening; human; medical education; medical genetics; molecular medicine; problem based learning; procedures; teaching; video game; Computational Biology; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Genetic Diseases, Inborn; Genetic Testing; Genetics, Medical; Humans; Molecular Medicine; Problem-Based Learning; Teaching; User-Computer Interface; Video Games";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

The system features moderate gamification, intended to motivate the student to use the machine repeatedly. The system records each handwash stage, and those found to be difficult are identified and reported back. The gamification element alone was not sufficient to encourage repeated use of the machine, with only 13.6 per cent of 611 eligible students interacting with the machine on one or more occasion. Overall engagement remained low (mean sessions per user: 3.5, ±0.60 confidence interval), even following recruitment of infection control ambassadors who were given a specific remit to encourage engagement with the system. Compliance monitoring was introduced to explore how students used the system. Hand hygiene performance did not improve with repeated use. There was evidence that the stages-fingers interlaced, rotation of the thumb, rotation of the fingertips and rotation of the wrists-were more challenging for students to master (p=0.0197 to p<0.0001) than the back of the hand and of the fingers.

An important premise of entrepreneurship education is that it can be learned and students can be taught to formulate entrepreneurial mentality, skills and competencies, something that can result in the formulation of startups and business initiatives. Given the importance of entrepreneurship, the necessity to formulate efficient entrepreneurship education frameworks and training programs arise. In this work, we present the design of an entrepreneurship educational environment that is based on learning in 3D virtual worlds. Innovative 3D virtual reality technologies were utilized to provide immersive and efficient learning activities. Various topics of entrepreneurship education courses were designed and formulated to offer students the opportunity to obtain theoretical knowledge of entrepreneurship. The 3D virtual reality educational environment utilizes pedagogical approaches that are based on gamification principles, allowing students to study in immersive ways as well as in game-based learning activities on real challenges that can be found in business environments. The game-based learning activities can help students gain necessary skills, helping them to tackle everyday obstacles on their entrepreneurial pathways. An experimental study was performed to explore the learning efficiency of the environment and the gamified learning activities as well as assess their learning impact on student's motivation, attitude, and overall learning experience.

It has become a novel way of interaction among people and influences people’s social lives and public opinion as well as people’s purchasing decisions and businesses. Any website or platform that allows social interaction is considered to be a social media site. Social media use among children in 25 European countries has been reported to be 38% among 9–12 year olds and 77% among those aged 13–16 years. All these children report having their own profile on at least one social network site. While social networking provides children and adolescents with many opportunities and benefits, it also carries many risks. Among the benefits are socialization and communication enhancement, improving learning skills, positive impact on education and getting health information. Potential risks of social media use include falsifying age and identity, cyberbullying, sexting, Facebook depression, gamification, glamourization, cyberostracism and sleep disturbances. Conclusion: Paediatricians play a vital role in promoting the physical, mental and social welfare of all children. There is a critical need for paediatricians to play an active role, guiding children and families appropriately through the impact of social networking, in order to become a real driver of children’s development. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.";"Cyberbullying; Gamification; Glamourization; Sexting; Social media; Social media use";"adolescent; Article; child; cyberbullying; cyberostracism; depression; education; gamification; glamourization; human; interpersonal communication; learning; medical information; ostracism; pediatrician; physical appearance; priority journal; sexting; sleep disorder; social interaction; social media; social network; socialization; video game; adolescent behavior; child behavior; pediatrics; physician attitude; procedures; social media; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Child; Child Behavior; Humans; Pediatrics; Physician's Role; Social Media";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Materials and Methods: We designed the serious game, CODIFICO, as an alternative way to teach ICD-10 diagnosis coding to undergraduate medical students. To assess the pedagogical effect of the game, we used the quasiexperimental pretest-posttest design. The participants began by completing a knowledge pretest on Blackboard. After the pretest, the teacher presented the game to the students and invited them to play it for 1 week. Then, the students completed the posttest on Blackboard. We applied the Wilcoxon test to establish the difference between the pretest and posttest. We designed a questionnaire to evaluate the participants' technology acceptance toward the game. Results: Sixty-one undergraduate medical students from a large Colombian private university took part. There was no statistically significant difference between the pretest and the posttest. However, the game had some positive effects on knowledge. The game was well accepted among the participants. Conclusion: The game, CODIFICO, was useful to teach diagnosis determination, not diagnostic coding. Some of the reasons that caused this situation were insufficient attention to the pedagogical theory, excessive reliance on clinical aspects of the medical training, limited resources, and lack of experience at the medical school to design gamification strategies. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.";"Clinical coding; International Classification of Diseases; Learning; Medical education; Serious games";"adult; article; attention; clinical feature; coding; female; human; human experiment; ICD-10; learning; major clinical study; male; medical education; medical school; medical student; pretest posttest design; questionnaire; rank sum test; teacher; Colombia; International Classification of Diseases; learning; medical education; medical student; procedures; psychology; video game; Adult; Colombia; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Female; Humans; International Classification of Diseases; Learning; Male; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Video Games";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Large companies are leading in the creation of educational video games for their internal training or to enhance their public image and universities can benefit from collaborating. The aim of this research is to evaluate, both objectively and subjectively, the potential of the simulation game BugaMAP (developed by the MAPFRE Foundation) for university teaching about insurance. To this end, we have assessed both the game itself and the experience of using the game as perceived by 142 economics students from various degree plans and courses at the University of Seville during the 2017-2018 academic year. As a methodology, a checklist of gamification components is used for the objective evaluation, and an opinion questionnaire on the game experience is used for the subjective evaluation. Among the results several findings stand out. One is the high satisfaction of the students with the knowledge acquired using fun and social interaction. Another is that the role of the university professors and the company monitors turns out to be very active and necessary during the game-learning sessions. Finally, in addition to the benefits to the university of occasionally available quality games to accelerate student skills training, the company-university collaboration serves as a trial and refinement of innovative tools for game-based learning. © 2019 MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute.

These technologies are also very important for the learning and transmission of intangible cultural heritage (ICH) creations, which include, among others, dance, theater, and other skills where body motion has a primary role. However, creating games can be time consuming and usually demands a significant effort. Therefore, this paper focuses on the design and development of a novel framework for the rapid design of body-motion-based customizable game-like applications. This framework consists of two components: (i) an interface that allows the user to design the game and capture the motion data, and (ii) a customizable game for learning and training using off-the-shelf motion-capture sensors like the Microsoft Kinect. The game is automatically configured based on the output of the game design interface. In order to evaluate the proposed system, three pilot-use cases have been selected: (i) the Latin dance Salsa, (ii) the Greek traditional dance Tsamiko, and (iii) the Walloon (Belgian) traditional dance. Moreover, small-scaled experiments concerning the three different use cases were conducted, where both beginners and experts evaluated the game-like application for dance learning. Furthermore, a group of dance experts were asked to design and generate their own game and evaluate their experience. Results showed that the use of such a game-like application could be efficient, as positive feedback was obtained. In summary, participants found that the generated game-like application meets its objectives; it is generally efficient and satisfactory and offers a novel tool for ICH transmission and education. Last but not the least, the dance experts expressed their interest in developing more such games in the future, since they characterized the game design module as easy and intuitive to use. © 2018, Beijing Normal University.";"Adaptive framework; Exergames; Intangible cultural heritage education; Sensorimotor learning; Serious games";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

More specifically, the aim was to empirically explore and develop knowledge about the process of designing for gamification teaching in K-12 education, to develop gamification teaching design principles and, in addition, to study how emergent technologies could be used in this context. Four sub-studies were conducted between 2014 and 2018 which included four groups of university students as co-creators in the teaching designs. The empirical material is based on observations from the field test in which school students tested university student designs. Post interviews were conducted with participating school teachers and university students. In addition, university student written reports were included. Findings illustrate four themes; 1) The design process of the gamification teaching activities, 2) The gamification teaching design principles developed, 3) The school students' experiences of the gamification designs and 4) Designing gamification teaching activities - a complex process. Findings show that designing for gamification teaching designs using emergent technologies is quite a complex process. This complexity concerns, among other things, the puzzle of combining the different knowledge domains into the TPACK Model (i.e. technological knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, content knowledge) in an emergent teaching practice (gamification) with the use of emergent technologies. The co-creation process and the move between these knowledge domain areas could maximize the effect of achieving a pedagogical balance concerning what school students perceive as fun without sacrificing focus on their knowledge acquisition and learning processes. © 2019.

It remains unclear, however, which app features are particularly effective and encourage sustained app usage. Behavior change techniques (BCTs) and gamification are promising approaches to improve user engagement. However, little is known about the frequency BCTs and gamification techniques (GTs) are actually used. This app review aims to provide an overview of BCTs and GTs in current diabetes management apps. Methods: Google’s Play Store was searched for applications using a broad search strategy (keyword: “diabetes”). We limited our research to freely available apps. A total of 56 apps matched the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in terms of the features they offer to support self-management. We used a taxonomy comprising 29 BCTs and 17 GTs to evaluate the applications. Two independent raters tested and evaluated each app. Results: Interrater agreement was high (ICC =.75 for BCTs; ICC =.90 for GTs). An average of 7.4 BCTs (SD = 3.1) and an average of 1.4 out of 17 GTs (SD = 1.6) were implemented in each app. Five out of 29 BCTs accounted for 55.8% of the BCTs identified in total. The GT most often identified was “feedback” and accounted for 50% of the GTs. Conclusions: The potential of BCTs and GTs in diabetes management apps has not been fully exploited yet. Only very restricted sets of BCTs and gamification features were implemented. Systematic research on the efficacy of specific BCTs and GTs is needed to provide further guidance for app design. © 2019 Diabetes Technology Society.";"apps; behavior change techniques; diabetes self-management; gamification; mHealth";"hemoglobin A1c; insulin; artificial intelligence; behavior change; blood glucose monitoring; blood pressure; diabetes mellitus; drug dose; education; exercise; fitness; food intake; game; health care personnel; human; Internet; learning; mobile application; outcome assessment; physical activity; Review; self care; self monitoring; taxonomy; behavior therapy; diabetes mellitus; diabetic complication; mobile application; mobile phone; procedures; video game; Behavior Therapy; Cell Phone; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus; Humans; Mobile Applications; Self-Management; Video Games";"English";"Review";"All Open Access, Green";"Scopus"

The teaching unit was based on an action research approach that includes a careful selection of pedagogical techniques and instruments to attract and keep the attention and interest of the students. In addition to the robotics lessons, a previous computational thinking training with Blockly Games was carried out, which contributed to noticeably increase the students motivation and to introduce them to the programming of robots. Moreover, gamification was used to motivate and evaluate the individual knowledge, and the students were required to present the work performed through a final project. The individual needs of the students were fulfilled with a daily monitoring. The results show that the pedagogical techniques, instruments and evaluation were adequate to increase the motivation of the students and to obtain a significant learning, showing how the teaching of CT may attract students that have lost interest and motivation, while providing them with abilities that will be essential for the learning throughout life. © 2019 by the authors.";"Competency-based education; Computational thinking; Educational games; Problem solving; Robotics";"action research; education; learning; robotics; secondary education; student; sustainable development; teaching; training";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold";"Scopus"

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the short-term effectiveness of “Fit, Food, Fun” (FFF), a serious game to impart nutritional knowledge among children and adolescents. Data collection was conducted at two secondary schools in Bavaria, Germany. The gameplay intervention (gameplay group; GG) consisted of a 15-minute FFF gameplay session during each of three consecutive days. The teaching intervention (teaching group; TG) was performed in a classic lecture format. Nutritional knowledge was evaluated via questionnaires at baseline and post-intervention. Statistical analyses were performed using R (R Core Team, 2018). In total, baseline data were available for 39 participants in the GG and 44 participants in the TG. The mean age was 13.5 ± 0.7 years in the GG and 12.8 ± 0.9 years in the TG. There was a significant (p-value < 0.001) improvement in nutritional knowledge in both intervention groups. Moreover, a between-group difference with a significantly (p-value = 0.01) higher increase in nutritional knowledge was detected for the TG.

Data sources PubMed (including MEDLINE), CINAHL, Science Direct (including EMBASE), BioMed Central, ACM digital, Emerald Insight, Google Scholar and Research Gate. Methods Studies that were published between 1 January 2002 and 31 May 2018 in English were included if the participants were adults, with at least one long-term condition, were able to self-administer their medication and were treated in primary care settings. The quality of evidence was assessed with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system and the risk of bias was appraised using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results From a total of 27 studies that matched the inclusion criteria, 12 were excluded due to low quality of evidence, 10 were rated moderate and 5 were rated high quality. All the included studies had low sample size and limited follow-up duration. Thirteen of the included studies found that the use of a PHR has increased medication adherence. The identified design features are reminders, education, personalisation and tailoring, feedback and alerts, gamification, medication management, medical appointment management, diary and self-monitoring, health condition management, set goals, patient's blog and tethered. It was impossible to draw conclusions as to which feature is important to what group of patients and why. The most frequently identified conditions were HIV and diabetes. This review did not identify any papers with negative results. It was not possible to numerically aggregate the PHR effect due to high heterogeneity of the medication adherence measurement, study type, participants and PHRs used. Conclusion Although we found recurrent evidence that PHRs can improve medication adherence, there is little evidence to date to indicate which design features facilitate this process. © 2019 Author(s).";"long-term conditions; medical informatics; medication adherence; personal health record; PHR; systematic literature review";"blogging; chronic disease; constructive feedback; demography; diabetes mellitus; electronic health record; electronic patient record; follow up; game; GRADE approach; health care management; health literacy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; laboratory test; medical examination; medication compliance; medication therapy management; motivation; patient education; patient scheduling; personalized medicine; polypharmacy; primary medical care; quality control; reminder system; Review; self monitoring; social media; systematic review; adult; chronic disease; medical record; randomized controlled trial (topic); Adult; Chronic Disease; Health Records, Personal; Humans; Medication Adherence; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic";"English";"Review";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

The purpose of the study is to identify the characteristic features of designing digital learning environments through the use of gaming technology. Materials and Methods. The methodology is based on the analysis and synthesis of research studies on general didactics, gamification of education, and digital technologies in education, recognized in the scientific community. Theoretical and practical methods of psychological and educational research were used. The educational experiment focused on assessing the formation of basic digital literacy competencies. Results. The study reveals that the ""quest"" game technology facilitates learning and professional activities, as well as contributes to creating active learning environment .The author argues that the peculiarities of designing particular learning environments based on gaming platforms are determined by individual and age-specific characteristics of students, their interests and professional orientations, the priorities of the digital school, and the selected gamification resources. Conclusions. The author summarizes the following characteristic features of designing digital learning environments based on the use of gaming technologies: enhancing cognitive skills, personalizing the educational process, changing teacher’s role and introducing advanced forms of education based on digital technologies. © 2011–2019 Science for Education Today All rights reserved";"Cross-professional competences; Digital technologies; Educational environment; Game-based activities; Mobile applications";"";"Russian";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold";"Scopus"

Design/methodology/approach: The use of the LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® (LSP) method in the context of transformative learning in Higher Education was used to drive a Situational analysis with sixteen postgraduate nursing students, from African learning contexts. This methodological approach was used to specifically explore their identity as learners and then to facilitate processes of critical introspection on social constructivist learning opportunities. Findings: Students’ perceived LSP permitted a deeper level of critical introspection on their transformative learning journeys than alternative approaches, such as written discourse or extended narratives, could have provided. They also perceived that a major benefit of using the LSP method was that it enabled them to understand and articulate their stories more easily than if they verbally reported them first. Research limitations/implications: The sampling the authors used was purposive and reflective of the Nigerian background of our research participants, who study at the University of Sunderland. Practical implications: LSP was perceived as an effective vehicle for the facilitation of reflection and self-awareness, which consequently contribute to students’ capacities to function at a metacognitive level. This has the potential to contribute to authentic transformative learning. Academic learning at postgraduate level hinged on the capacity of students to develop a pragmatic and working knowledge of what acknowledging their epistemic cognition entailed. Originality/value: The methodological approach implemented in this paper provides a unique means of harnessing a now common gamification technique in pedagogic practice. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.";"Critical introspection; Epistemic cognition; LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® (LSP); Metacognition; Situational analysis";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

However, while the number of publications on gamification has been increasing in recent years, a classification of its empirical effects is still missing. We present a systematic literature review conducted with the purpose of closing this gap by clarifying what effects gamification generates on users' behaviour in online learning. Based on the studies analysed, the game elements most used in the literature are identified and mapped with the effects they produced on learners. Furthermore, we cluster these empirical effects of gamification into six areas: performance, motivation, engagement, attitude towards gamification, collaboration, and social awareness. The findings of our systematic literature review point out that gamification and its application in online learning and in particular in Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) are still a young field, lacking in empirical experiments and evidence with a tendency of using gamification mainly as external rewards. Based on these results, important considerations for the gamification design of MOOCs are drawn. © 2019 MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute.

However, if teachers themselves are not motivated, or if they lack a positive attitude towards implementing these new methodologies, it will be dificult for students to feel motivated when approaching said resources. Therefore, it is important to know what teachers' attitudes towards them are. The aim of this research is the creation of an attitudes scale towards collaborative learning with video games, aimed at in-service primary school teachers. Different methodological steps were followed that made its construction possible, such as the analysis of items and the verification of their reliability, resulting in a rigorous attitudes scale of 33 items, with a reliability of α = 0.947.

Consequently, strategies are required to boost significant learning as well as sustained motivation during the delivery of the course. For this reason, the following investigation determines if the didactic strategy of gamification encourages engagement in a university level programming course. The article presents two interventions that took place during the period of January to April 2017 and January to April 2018 in a University of Mexico using the challenge-based gamification pedagogical strategy. This strategy supports the Werbach and Hunter methodology. The dynamics were emotional, social, and progressive and were conducted through challenge and opportunities mechanics. The components were points, badges, avatars, and a leaderboard. In both interventions, surveys were used to know the acceptance of the strategy on behalf of the students, and a meta-evaluation instrument was applied after the first intervention with the purpose of strengthening and improving the didactic strategy.

Ninety-eight first-year students, majoring in English at a Chinese university, were invited to participate in this study. In this game, students need to find the answers to 24 environment-themed questions phrased in English. Guided by prior technology acceptance research, we employed a mixed methods approach to capture participants' experience and perception of the process. The results show that this approach was positively perceived among the participants, for it could not only enrich their language learning experience but also promote their awareness of the environment.

To address this gap, this research work examines the students’ behavior toward earning badges and how it relates to their engagement in a gamified MOOC. According to the results, the behaviors toward badges of the active students were generally positive and significantly correlated with other variables measuring their engagement (e.g., pageviews, submitted tasks, forum posts), although this positive behavior seems to decrease throughout the course. Additionally, students that reported high motivation by badges at the end of the course showed a higher engagement level than those that were not appealed by badges. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.";"Badges; Engagement; Gamification; MOOC; Perceptions; Rewards";"Motivation; Open access; Sensory perception; Badges; Engagement; Gamification; MOOC; Rewards; Students";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Green";"Scopus"

To test whether gamification could be used to engage low-motivation smokers, we conceptualized ""Take a Break"" - a 3-week technology-assisted challenge for smokers to compete in setting and achieving brief abstinence goals. Materials and Methods: In the feasibility study of the multi-technology Take a Break challenge, low-motivation smokers were given (1) daily motivational messages, (2) brief ""challenge quizzes"" related to smoking behaviors, (3) a telehealth call to personalize their abstinence goal for the challenge, (4) ""coping minigames"" to help manage cravings while attempting to achieve their brief abstinence goals, and (5) a leaderboard ""webApp,"" providing comparative feedback on smokers' participation, and allowing for competition. Heterogeneity of engagement was tracked. Results: All 41 smokers initially reported that they were not actively quitting. Over half were employed less than full time (51%), completed less than a 4-year college education (76%), and experienced financial stress (54%). No smokers opted out of the motivational messages, and mean proportion of response to the challenge quizzes was 0.88 (SD = 0.19). Half of the smokers reported using the ""coping minigames."" Almost all set abstinence goals (78%), with over half lasting 1-2 days (51%); median = 1 day (IQR 1-7). Leaderboard points ranged widely.

Data obtained from the semi-structured interview form were analyzed by content analysis; other data were analyzed by descriptive analysis. Writing skills and gamification were related in the study. Turkish Language Teaching Program (2018) has been taken into consideration in the action plan which relates to gamification and writing skill. As a result of the study, it was seen that all participants were actively involved in the implementation process. In addition, it was concluded that gamification increased the interest of students towards the course, combined school and non-school life, facilitated classroom management, supported collaborative work, and developed creativity. As a result of this study, it is suggested that digital games can be used as a text type in Turkish language lessons with the method of gamification in order to positively affect motivation of the middle school students toward writing education. © 2019, Anadolu University, Faculty of Communication Sciences.

This paper advances the state of the art by providing a practical way to help implement this kind of system. In this study, we present, for the first time, how one can apply gamification elements in a learning system using the Design Sprint method, to guide designers and developers on replicating this process. Additionally, as starting point, we use a taxonomy composed of 21 game elements, proposed to be used within learning environments, organised into five game element categories, according to their goal/usage. Our main contribution is to present how to systematically implement the gamification elements focused on educational ends, which is of special value to practitioners, designers and developers. © 2019 National Taiwan Normal University.";"Design; Design sprint; Educatiojii; Gamification; Taxonomy";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

However, gamefulness is defined imprecisely across the literature. To address this, we present a theory of gamefulness that splits gamefulness into more specific constructs and outlines their effects in a process model. Method: We integrate extant literature from psychology, human-computer interaction, and other fields to define gameful design, systems, and experiences. Most critically, we argue that gameful experience is the core focal construct of this theory and define it as an interactive state occurring when a person perceives non-trivial achievable goals created externally, is motivated to pursue them under an arbitrary set of behavioral rules, and evaluates that motivation as voluntary. Results: We present six resulting propositions: (1)gameful systems lead to gameful experiences, (2)gameful systems impact psychological characteristics, (3)effective gameful design leads to gameful systems, (4)effective gameful systems lead to behavioral change, (5)appropriate behavioral change causes the distal outcomes gamification designers target, and (6)individual differences moderate the effectiveness of gameful systems. Conclusion: Gameful experience theory provides researchers with a unified foundation to study gamification from any social scientific lens. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd";"";"Engineering; Hardware; Behavioral changes; Behavioral rules; Gameful designs; Gamification; Individual Differences; Process Modeling; Psychological characteristics; Psychological state; Human computer interaction";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Here, we present robust qualitative evidence from a case study which documents the social relationships, motivation and engagement of a class of ten-year-old children who used an active smartphone cognitive training game called BrainQuest in their physical education lessons over a period of 5 weeks. Game design elements which are intended to move beyond simple gamification of cognitive tests are presented, along with a discussion of how these design elements worked in practice. The paper also presents and discusses the impact of the game upon the cognitive and emotional regulatory skills, characterised by executive function skills, based on the findings of this initial work.

In higher education, gamification is a methodology intending to motivate students to acquire academical knowledge and soft skills, while keeping them engaged and pleased with the learning process. This study reports the application of a gamified class concerning electric resistors, the first of a 12-topic discipline offered to 2nd-year students in physics and engineering. Adopting a Flipped Classroom methodology and a narrative based on household power consumption, traditional contents about resistors and electricity were taught. Also, instructions about how to use an ohm-meter and how to configure an electronic spreadsheet to do basic statistics were given. In order to customize and enrich the class, some optional contents (usually in a video) were made available. The access to the experimental activities was constrained by approval in four graded quizzes. Every activity was acknowledged by virtual coins to be converted in benefits (extra time to run final examinations, permission to consult class appointments and the opportunity to re-discuss a mistake in the final examination) and points, to rank students (leaderboard). Forty-five students attended the gamified class. No control group was implemented because this study aimed to find a good design for a gamified class, not to compare traditional to active methodologies. The overall student acceptance was excellent, and they reported that gamification can be a more engaging methodology than traditional classes, further developing soft skills and academic knowledge. However, the time spent to run the gamified class must be arranged, reducing the time inside the classroom. The opportunity to perform the experiment was considered essential, and could not be substituted by videos or texts since new doubts and concerns are pointed out during the practice when the teacher is present. Gamification can be a methodology capable of engaging and being enjoyable students, giving them more than just information but also soft skills. © 2019 European Physical Society.";"Active learning; gamification; physics; STEM";"Artificial intelligence; Electric resistance; Learning systems; Physics; Resistors; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Active Learning; Active methodologies; Classroom methodologies; Electronic spreadsheets; Experimental activities; Experimental physics; Final examinations; Gamification; Students";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Thus, efforts such as educational interventions among high-risk populations, especially the youth, are key to increasing public awareness regarding leptospirosis. This paper presents the findings of a pilot study wherein an educational intervention using a gamification intervention method was used to determine changes in leptospirosis knowledge among youth. On this note, students from a public university in Seremban district, Malaysia, were recruited and were asked to complete questionnaires before and after gamification activities. Baseline and immediate post-intervention data on leptospirosis knowledge were obtained. The total knowledge score was calculated, and differences in the mean pre-and post-intervention knowledge score were determined. Of the total 185 questionnaires that were completed at baseline and immediately post-intervention, only 168 that belonged to respondents who had heard of leptospirosis were analysed in this paper. A significant increase in leptospirosis knowledge was observed for the students following health education by gamification (p < 0.01). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of an educational intervention using gamification in improving leptospirosis knowledge among youth and suggest that gamification could become an efficient tool to prevent the disease within university-age demographics. © 2019 by the authors.

First, we study the existing KMS models and related previous researches. Furthermore we added several elements that came from games into the proposed KMS model. Adding elements that came from games expected can increase the motivation of researchers to be more productive, which in turn can increase the research output in HEI. We compare elements that came from games and elements came from the previous KMS model. The result of the brief comparison shows the elements came from games more dynamic then elements came from previous KMS model.

Evidently, there are studies that show that the use of computer games in students can improve critical thinking skills. Therefore, a critical thinking game can be devised to help solve the above problems. Critical thinking games are built using the Digital Game Based Learning - Instructional Design method, paradigm that uses computer games as a way to deliver learning content and utilize gamification to attract end users and engage them to understand the intended content. Design of Digital Game-Based Learning consists of several stages that must be carried out, including analysis, design, development, quality assurance, implementation, and evaluation. This critical thinking training game is named Lulu’s Friend. Lulu’s Friend game only implements 3 critical thinking skills, namely interpretation, analysis, and conclusions. The content of learning material in Lulu’s Friend gameis derived from IPA 4th grade science syllabus.

Although some might still believe in the traditional method such as rote learning, the nature of the current alpha gen who are more prone towards the integration of technology caused many of the believers to have second thoughts about it. Besides that, the conventional classroom might not be entertaining and fun anymore as they are exposed to mobile phones and laptops daily, they require lessons that require them to move around, engage and do a lot of hands-on activities. Though it is not the central end of English language acquisition, teachers are still concern of how they get to assess their learners’ comprehension on the subject matter effectively. Irregular verbs is one of the greatest challenge in second language learning as it involved functioning brute memory. Hence, the main issue at hand is how to activate the brute memory if there’s no active engagement within the learners during the learning process?This led to another question on what can teachers do to make their learners motivated, engaged and actively involved in the learning process.As we are looking forward to find the solution to this matter, this paper is aimed to explore the benefits of using Kahoot!

Background: The family nurse practitioner program uses graduate Health Education Systems Incorporated examination as a quality indicator and program benchmark. A downward trend in Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores stimulated a need for change. Two strategies were implemented to enhance engagement and improve synthesis of clinical information. Case-based learning and gamification involves the use of game thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts to engage users in solving problems while the case-based discussions act as formative assessment tool, providing information on student's progress and development. Objectives: To assess the implementation of innovative strategies on the Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores and to enhance students engagement and synthesis of clinical information. Method: Case presentations were created in the Learning Management System an online program, for every module. Interwoven throughout the module are various game elements. The game elements include voluntary participation with immediate feedback that can be both positive and negative and provides a social connection. The student has the freedom to fail and the freedom to choose without significant repercussions. Results: The results showed examination scores increased significantly. Using a one-way analysis of variance to compare Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores between semester cohorts of students, followed by a post hoc pairwise comparison a statistically significant difference (p <.001) between previous semesters was identified. Conclusion: Although there are many approaches for online learning, using case presentations can mirror different social and cultural situations to challenge the learner. Case-based discussion and gamification strategies are effective in engaging students in a challenging environment. Student responded positively to case-base presentation with game elements. Using this approach is designed to challenge and add value to the learning experience. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd";"Case-based learning; Engagement; Gamification; Online education";"advanced practice nursing; analysis of variance; article; case report; clinical article; health education; human; human experiment; learning; mechanics; problem solving; student; synthesis; advanced practice nursing; education; game; nursing education; nursing student; problem based learning; procedures; Advanced Practice Nursing; Education, Distance; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Educational Measurement; Games, Experimental; Humans; Problem-Based Learning; Students, Nursing";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

We conduct a qualitative case study with the participation of 86 fifth grade students across two elementary schools which have a significant minority enrolment. We demonstrate the ways in which the students draw on recently-acquired knowledge, engage in dramatic play, share the digital space and collaborate intensively to achieve a new and refined understanding of concepts and behaviours linked to perspective-taking.

While the results in general lean towards positive findings about the effectiveness of gamification, the amount of mixed results is remarkable. Furthermore, education, health and crowdsourcing as well as points, badges and leaderboards persist as the most common contexts and ways of implementing gamification. Concurrently, gamification research still lacks coherence in research models, and a consistency in the variables and theoretical foundations.

Based on continued research, however, the badge began to be recognized as a scale to measure the learner's knowledge and skill and an important means of helping learners to gradually build intrinsic motivation by using certain extrinsic motivators. As the badge's value has grown, the importance of its design has garnered attention. Objective: The objective of this research was to establish a badge design framework that can be used in a gamified learning environment. Methods: Data were collected from previous studies on badge design, 943 badge cases were extracted from 11 online and offline gamification in education contents, and their patterns and features were analyzed. Results: Based on the analysis of results from previous studies and 943 collected badge cases, our study suggests three conditions for badge design. Through the literature review and collected badge cases, our study designed a badge design framework. First, it is necessary to distinguish whether the type of learning activity required for earning badges is physical or conceptual. Second, it is necessary to distinguish whether the scale of an activity required for earning badges requires individual learning or interaction-induced learning. Third, it is important to review whether the time and effort invested in earning badges is simple, repetitive, and short-term or continuous and long-term. Based on these three conditions, collected badge cases were analyzed. To verify self-developed badge types, we conducted a chi-square test on the collected cases and confirmed that there was a significant difference for each of the eight badge types (Pearson chi-square 1117.7, P<.001).

More specifically, this paper focuses on gamification, considers the needs of all learners, including those who identify as disabled, and raises important inquiries about equity and access to technological instructional materials. Design/methodology/approach: Juxtaposing Kapp’s (2012) nine elements of gamification with aspects of accessibility, this paper conceptualizes the challenges and possibilities associated with gamified instructional approaches. Findings: This paper examines gamification in light of potential barriers that exist as disabled learners navigate online courses that include one or more of the following aspects of gamification – game-based, mechanics, aesthetics, game-thinking, engage, people, motivate action, promote learning, and solve problems. Notably, online courses enhanced with gamification elements present potential access barriers and challenges to learners who identify with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, or visual disabilities. Research limitations/implications: This paper initiates an important discussion, and as such, it incepts additional investigations into supporting differently abled learners. Practical implications: By examining gamification through the lens of accessibility, this paper contributes yet another perspective of teaching, learning, and instructional design. Originality/value: In addition to socio-economic factors that may preclude one from engaging in a digital play, there is a larger question of how, if at all, gamification is accessible to learners with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, or visual disabilities or impairments. This paper raises important questions for educators, education researchers, and game and instructional designers alike to ensure ubiquitous access to gamified digital materials in general, and online, gamified materials in particular. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.";"Accessibility; ADA; Disabilities; Gamification; Instructional design; Section 508; Universal design";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

In the future, it is expected that gamification will overtake the traditional way of learning resulting in issues such as scalability, upgradation of learning modules. To address these issues, merging gamification with cloud computing seems a viable solution. However, the employability of gamification through cloud computing is still in its infant stage. Hence, this article investigates the applicability of gamification through cloud computing and presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art gamification in education and learning. We also identify the subject areas that can be gamified and taught using the cloud service. The critical elements and minimum requirements necessary to gamify education are also identified. Moreover, a specific cloud-assisted gamification architecture is proposed and discussed together with its possible applications.

Serious gaming and gamification education have the potential to provide a quality, cost-effective, novel approach that is flexible, portable, and enjoyable and allow interaction with tutors and peers. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of serious gaming/gamification for health professions education compared with traditional learning, other types of digital education, or other serious gaming/gamification interventions in terms of patient outcomes, knowledge, skills, professional attitudes, and satisfaction (primary outcomes) as well as economic outcomes of education and adverse events (secondary outcomes). Methods: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, Educational Resources Information Centre, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature was conducted from 1990 to August 2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently searched, screened, and assessed the study quality and extracted data. A meta-analysis was not deemed appropriate due to the heterogeneity of populations, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes. Therefore, a narrative synthesis is presented. Results: A total of 27 RCTs and 3 cluster RCTs with 3634 participants were included. Two studies evaluated gamification interventions, and the remaining evaluated serious gaming interventions. One study reported a small statistically significant difference between serious gaming and digital education of primary care physicians in the time to control blood pressure in a subgroup of their patients already taking antihypertensive medications. There was evidence of a moderate-to-large magnitude of effect from five studies evaluating individually delivered interventions for objectively measured knowledge compared with traditional learning. There was also evidence of a small-to-large magnitude of effect from 10 studies for improved skills compared with traditional learning. Two and four studies suggested equivalence between interventions and controls for knowledge and skills, respectively. Evidence suggested that serious gaming was at least as effective as other digital education modalities for these outcomes. There was insufficient evidence to conclude whether one type of serious gaming/gamification intervention is more effective than any other. There was limited evidence for the effects of serious gaming/gamification on professional attitudes. Serious gaming/gamification may improve satisfaction, but the evidence was limited. Evidence was of low or very low quality for all outcomes. Quality of evidence was downgraded due to the imprecision, inconsistency, and limitations of the study. Conclusions: Serious gaming/gamification appears to be at least as effective as controls, and in many studies, more effective for improving knowledge, skills, and satisfaction. However, the available evidence is mostly of low quality and calls for further rigorous, theory-driven research. © 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Design: Quasi-experimental. Setting: Thirty-seven kindergartens from Portugal. Participants: Eight hundred seventy-seven families. Intervention: Web-based social network of participants' interactions, educational materials, apps and nutritional challenges, focused on fruit, vegetables, sugar, and salt. Main Outcome Measures: Parental nutrition literacy (self-reported survey – 4 dimensions: Nutrients, Food portions, Portuguese food wheel groups, Food labeling). Analysis: General linear model – Repeated measures was used to analyze the effect on the nutrition literacy score. Results: Families uploaded 1267 items (recipes, photographs of challenges) and educators uploaded 327 items (photographs, videos) onto the interactive platform. For the intervention group (n = 106), the final mean (SD) score of nutrition literacy was significantly higher than the baseline: 78.8% (15.6) vs 72.7% (16.2); P <.001, regardless of parental education and perceived income status. No significant differences in the scores of the control group (n = 83) were observed (final 67.8% [16.1] vs initial 66.4% [15.6]; P =.364).

The second feature is a session limit that was designed to prevent users from “binging” the game, because this could prevent deep learning. Results showed that generic feedback was more effective than tailored feedback, contrasting our expectations. The session limit, however, did prevent binging without reducing the overall number of sessions played.

It is recognised that patient safety and human factors' education is necessary for doctors to practice safely. Teaching patient safety to medical students is difficult. Institutions must develop expertise and build curricula while students must also be able to see the subject as relevant to future practice. Consequently graduates may lack confidence in this area. Method We used gamification (the application of game design principles to education) to create a patient safety simulation for medical students using game elements. Gamification builds motivation and engagement, whilst developing teamwork and communication. We designed an escape room - a team-based game where learners solve a series of clinical and communication-based tasks in order to treat a fictional patient while avoiding a € clinician error'. This is followed up with an after action review where students reflect on their experience and identify learning points. Outcome Students praised the session's interactivity and rated it highly for gaining new knowledge and skills and for increasing confidence to apply patient safety concepts to future work. Conclusion Our findings are in line with existing evidence demonstrating the success of experiential learning interventions for teaching patient safety to medical students. Where the escape room has potential to add value is the use of game elements to engage learners with the experience being recreated despite its simplicity as a simulation. More thorough evaluation of larger pilots is recommended to continue exploring the effectiveness of escape rooms as a teaching method. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Likewise, health professionals' beliefs affect their advice and attitudes towards patients' treatment, becoming a possible cause of greater disability. The development of educational interventions based on the best scientific evidence in neurophysiology of pain could be a way to provide information and advice to primary care health professionals to change their cognition towards chronic non-specific low back pain. The use of Information and Communication Technologies allows the development of web sites, which might be one of the effective resources to modify misbeliefs and attitudes, in relation to the origin and meaning of non-specific chronic low back pain, of primary care professionals and that may modify their attitudes in patients' treatment. Methods: The aim of this project is to identify misbeliefs and attitudes of primary care physicians and nurses about chronic non-specific low back pain to develop a web-based educational tool using different educational formats and gamification techniques. This study has a mixed-method sequential exploratory design. The participants are medical and nursing staff working in primary care centers in the city of Lleida, Spain. For the qualitative phase of this study, the authors will use personal semi-structured interviews. For the quantitative phase the authors will use an experimental study design. Subjects will be randomly allocated using a simple random sample technique. The intervention group will have access to the web site where they will find information related to non-specific chronic low back pain, based on the information obtained in the qualitative phase. The control group will have access to a video explaining the clinical practice guidelines on low back pain. Discussion: This study has been designed to explore and modify the beliefs and attitudes about chronic low back pain of physicians and nurses working in primary care settings, using a web-based educational tool with different educational formats and gamification techniques. The aim of the educational intervention is to change their knowledge about the origin and meaning of pain, with the result of reducing their misbeliefs and attitudes of fear avoidance.

Most studies see gamification as a way of introducing gameful design (e.g., competition and social activity) into behavioural interventions. Gamification is often tied to using new digital technologies, especially smartphone apps and, although these might be enabling, there is no theoretical underpinning for making this a necessary condition. In comparison to other sectors, the design of gameful interventions in transport is under developed. Interventions that have or are introducing gamified designs include road safety and travel demand management initiatives and these have been shown to be more ongoingly successful than strategies which do not employ gameful designs. This paper explores gamification in the context of transport with the aim of proposing a framework for the design and implementation of gameful designs, providing a synthesis and critical appraisal of current practice. The proposed framework is underpinned by theoretical discussion and illustrated by case studies that have implemented some elements of gameful design. The framework is designed to lay the groundwork for greater implementation of gamified design in transport and mobility contexts to take advantage of the potential greater success in achieving travel behaviour change as well as highlighting how existing schemes could be improved and providing guidance for future research into gamification. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd";"Derived demand; Gamification; Gamified schemes; Incentives; Motivation; Travel demand management";"demand analysis; incentive; mobile phone; mobility; transportation safety; travel behavior; travel demand";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Green";"Scopus"

Simulation-based curricula have been developed for a number of procedures, including gastrointestinal endoscopy. Gamification, which is the application of game-design principles to non-game contexts, is an instructional strategy with potential to enhance learning. No studies have investigated the effects of a comprehensive gamification curriculum on the acquisition of endoscopic skills among novice endoscopists. Methods and analysis Thirty-six novice endoscopists will be randomised to one of two endoscopy SBT curricula: (1) the Conventional Curriculum Group, in which participants will receive 6 hours of one-on-one simulation training augmented with expert feedback and interlaced with 4 hours of small group teaching on the theory of colonoscopy or (2) the Gamified Curriculum Group, in which participants will receive the same curriculum with integration of the following game-design elements: A leaderboard summarising participants' performance, game narrative, achievement badges and rewards for top performance. In line with a progressive learning approach, simulation training for participants will progress from low to high complexity simulators, starting with a bench-top model and then moving to the EndoVR virtual reality simulator. Performance will be assessed at three points: Pretraining, immediately post-training and 4-6 weeks after training. Assessments will take place on the simulator at all three time points and transfer of skills will be assessed during two clinical colonoscopies 4-6 weeks post-training. Mixed factorial ANOVAs will be used to determine if there is a performance difference between the two groups during simulated and clinical assessments.

Traditional medical curricula rely primarily on clerkships during the clinical period of study to train clinical skills, while the preclinical period is mainly used to teach the basic sciences. In recent years, the early introduction of clinical skills training has received increased attention. This review aims to identify and summarize teaching approaches of clinical skills for medical students during preclinical years, namely, (1) framing objectives (2) learning activities, and (3) evaluation strategies. Although the clinical tutor's role is to ensure that students receive effective preclinical skills through different modes of learning (lectures, presentations, and problem-based learning), the role of advanced technologies, namely, simulation-based learning platforms and gamification are found to be very successful. To improve the communication skills, there is strong evidence in support of role plays, and similarly, for enhancing observation skills, an introduction of fine arts in clinical skills training was found to be very useful. Medical schools worldwide should give high priority to conduct faculty development programs on various aspects of training and teaching modalities, evaluation strategies, and improving the evaluation of various clinical skills. Students should be provided with sufficient learning opportunities including a well-equipped clinical skills laboratory and individual attention, and constructive feedback should be given to students for building their confidence level during their learning process. © 2019 Journal of Education and Health Promotion Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.";"Clinical skills; evaluation; fidelity; gamification; medical education; problem-based learning; role-plays; simulation";"";"English";"Review";"";"Scopus"

Although cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills are lifesaving skills, the gap between awareness and actual training remains significant. Advances in technology are shaping the future of education and innovative learning solutions are essential to facilitate effective and accessible training. This project objective is to develop a self-directed educational system for hands-on CPR training using virtual reality (VR) technology. Methods. HTC VIVE was the chosen VR engine, and Unity3D was the software used for development. CPR skills including chest compressions, rescue breathing, and automated external defibrillator (AED) are taught in VR through focused instructions, demonstrations, and simulated interactive scenarios with hands-on training sessions. A tracking system was designed using virtual planes and VIVE-Tracker for accurate measurements of chest compressions (rate, depth, and recoil), hands’ position and AED. A real mannequin was integrated in the VR space and overlaid with virtual 3D-human model for realistic haptic feedback and hands-on training. VIVE-controller was used for precise calibration between the mannequin location in real environment and the virtual human model in VR space. Results. The VR-CPR prototype was designed to be generic, approachable, and easy to follow. Realism and interaction were achieved through 3D virtual scenes simulating common sites at which cardiac arrest may occur. Variety in scenarios and gamification features like scoring and difficulty levels of training were made to enhance users’ engagement. The VR-mannequin hybrid system enabled quality training and immersive learning experience. Further, real-time feedback and scoring system are built for self-directed learning and optimal performance. Conclusions. The developed VR-hybrid product is a structured educational tool for hands-on CPR training and ongoing practice. This innovative technology provides self-directed learning with no restrictions of time, place, or personnel, which are the main challenges with current traditional courses. This product is a promising CPR training initiative in the evolution of digital education. © The Author(s) 2019.";"CPR; education; haptic feedback; healthcare; simulation; technology; virtual reality";"";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Bronze";"Scopus"

According to the literature, ESD affects not only the content of education, but also its process and outcomes. This requires a new learning culture based on participative processes and new teaching techniques. Among the different methods and techniques as typologized by Figueirò and Raufflet (2015), action and experiential learning methods offer a promising approach for teaching sustainability. However, no previous studies have empirically addressed the effects of this approach on sustainability learning outcomes. For this reason, with the objective of understanding the potentials and limitations of such methodology, this paper presents an exploratory study of a teaching experience based on the action and experiential learning approach, and in particular on the simulation game technique. A pre-game and post-game survey were developed to evaluate the students' learning experience of a business game focused on sustainability (napuro). The study was carried out at two universities in Switzerland. The results suggest that the action learning approach, and in particular, simulation and gaming, may successfully generate cognitive and affective learning outcomes which in turn may affect students' development of critical thinking skills. In addition, the study suggests the central role of motivation in influencing students' learning outcomes. The game seems to be more effective in influencing the student's expertise in the subject and their attitudes toward sustainability when the student records a high level of motivation to attend the course and interest in the subject before the game. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd";"Business education; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Corporate sustainability; Education for sustainable development; Gamification; Simulation game";"Computer aided software engineering; Electrostatic devices; Motivation; Planning; Sustainable development; Teaching; Business educations; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Corporate-sustainability; Education for sustainable development; Gamification; Simulation games; Students";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Even though gamification education plays an important role in online learning, there is no literature from the lecturer side that explains the benefits of applying gamification in the context of responsibility for giving student test scores and their impact on their attitude towards test scores. This study discusses the lecturer's negligence in providing test scores that are not timely using the viewboard method in the context of gamification.

It is therefore advisable to adopt a fragmented approach and selectively gamify individual processes and features, focusing on educational and research activities. When introducing gamification, top management should provide conceptual and regulatory support and HR specialists coordination. Using a distribution model of managerial functions for gaming activities and determining priorities, taking the use of artificial intelligence into account, is shown to be expedient. © 2019 Conscientia Beam.

Background The role of gamification in promoting students' learning has been investigated empirically by many scholars. To date, mixed results about the effectiveness of gamification have been reported, and researchers frequently argue that the in-appropriateness of certain techniques may have contributed to these mixed findings. Methodology The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol was used to assess the criteria required for this review. A total of 40 studies were identified and included in the systematic review. The selected studies were used to assess the association between certain gamification techniques and students' learning in this study. Findings The results showed that gamification techniques differently affect students' learning. In addition, it is important for students to be instructed about the application of gamification approach before they engage in a gamified learning task. The key challenges relating to the use of gamification techniques were also discussed.

Prior gamification research has yet to investigate the efficacy of using a choose-your-own-adventure style platform in the classroom. The purpose of this research is to explore the pedagogical value of that particular gamification method. Method/Design and Sample: Two independent studies using quantitative and qualitative data taken from three samples of marketing students at a large California university investigate the academic effectiveness, perceived helpfulness, and perceived enjoyment of a choose-your-own-adventure type game in the classroom via the open-source program Twine. Results: Results from Study 1 indicate marketing students take 23.8% less time while simultaneously scoring 10.2% higher on the module assessment when their lessons are gamified using Twine (vs. not gamified). Results from Study 2 suggest this particular gamification method also increases student engagement.

Gamification is a booming technology based on combining the psychological aspects, mechanics and dynamics of a game in non-ludic environments. The use of gamification has shown good outcomes in terms of increasing students´ motivation towards the sciences. In this study, new laboratory practices were developed under the umbrella of gamification methodology for pre-service teachers. The general objectives were to eliminate negative prejudices, fear and rejection attitudes towards science, to foster the conceptual and procedural learning of science among students and to provide students with real-life examples and an experience of applying gamification themselves. First, the theoretical basis of the main components and dynamics of gamification in the Education context are summarized. Secondly, their application in a specific subject from the curriculum for the Teaching Training in Primary Education degree (Didactics of Natural Science (DNS), 3rd year) are presented. The methodology was applied twice in laboratory practice in two consecutive academic years: 2017/2018 (5 groups, 150 students ) and 2018/2019 (6 groups, 183 students).

Nowhere else is this more important than in education. Considering the careful build-up and implementation of game-elements could improve academic performance outcome and student motivation. However, Gamification could require much more time to be designed and applied to education related activities and it also comes with significant operating and design cost to provide highly engaging activities for students. One of the main problems in designing Gamification is the question: “which game elements should be applied to student activities?”. Moreover one must make sure that it has great impact on students' performance in terms of their education related performance. Hence, in this research, we focused on studying the impact of each element in order to investigate the behavioral outcome of game elements in educational environments through the concept of knowledge and game-based learning from the Gamification concept. In our experiment, we examined the impact of each game element on senior high school students based on the basic elements of Gamification such as Leaderboard, Cooperative and Awarding badges. In addition, we studied the effect of the game-based learning application called Aqua Republica from UNEP and DHI centers with partner of Thailand. The experiment design compared two groups: the “Non-Gamified” and the “Gamified” groups participating in the game-based learning activity Aqua Republica.

This uncertain environment does not foster student effort and it is behind the important rates of abandon in higher education. The Bologna Process was thought to create a new paradigm in higher education in the European Union. However, the changes came from the top (governments) to the bottom (lectures and students) so they were not properly supported by specialized training oriented to lecturers. It did not include the appropriate changes in lower education stages (secondary education) to prepare student when facing University. Therefore, in the past decade several new teaching methodologies have appeared to deal with student demotivation and to fight against dropouts. Those methodologies try to keep the students engaged during the whole course paying more attention to their learning process, attitudes, motivations and expectations. Consequently, in this paper, we present a four-year experiment whose main objective is to keep students engaged during the whole year and to foster their motivation in order to increase their learning outcomes. The experiment is based on the application of gamification to the assessment process emulating a traditional platform video-game, like Super Mario. The results show that this experiment was positive for most students who achieved good marks and good rates of task completion. © 2020 Royal Society of Chemistry.

Therefore, we developed GaMR, a gamified framework for learning in mixed reality, where 3D models can be experienced on the Microsoft HoloLens and the HTC Vive. Quiz creation is supported by placing annotations on the model. Progress is rewarded by badges. The gamification strategy guides the student and gives feedback about the learning progress.

According to United Nations, in addition to our past research with hundreds of Arab deaf people over ten years, we reached the conclusion that most deaf people are undereducated or semi-literate. This is due to poor ways of communication with society and lack of means that support lifelong learning. Parity in life and self-learning systems are rights to everyone regardless of their ability. From this point, the aim of this project is to develop an e-learning system for teaching a difficult subject, such mathematics, to the Arab deaf students.

In domains such as education, marketing and health, where gamification techniques are applied, user engagement in applications has increased. In these applications the protection of users' privacy is an important aspect to consider, due to the applications obtaining a record of the personal information of their users. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to identify if applications where gamification is applied do respect users' privacy. For the accomplishment of this aim, two main steps have been implemented. Since the main principle of gamification is the existence of game elements, the first step was to identify the set of game elements recorded in the literature that are commonly applied in various applications. Afterwards, an examination of the relationship between these elements and privacy requirements was implemented in order to identify which elements conflict with the privacy requirements leading to potential privacy violations and which elements do not. A conceptual model according to the results of this examination was designed, which presents how elements conflict with requirements. Based on the results, there are indeed game elements which can lead to privacy violations. The results of this work provide valuable guidance to software developers, especially during the design stages of gamified applications since it helps them to consider the protection of users' privacy in parallel from the early stages of the application development onwards. © 2019 by the authors.";"Game elements; Gamification; Privacy; Privacy requirements";"Application programs; Application development; Conceptual model; Game elements; Gamification; Personal information; Privacy requirements; Privacy violation; Software developer; Data privacy";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

Drive by Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study believes that motivational affordance resulted from gamification activity may lead to psychological outcome, and this psychological outcome will lead to behavioural outcome. Methodology: The study was conducted using qualitative action research methodology with descriptive analysis in two classes of Enterprise Strategy course. Three phases were involved for data gathering. Main Findings: In phase 1, when traditional lecture was solely used, students seemed to be passive, indifferent and reluctant to participate. In phase 2, when traditional lecture is supplanted with gamification activity, students have participated actively. Similar results of phase 2 was found in phase 3, where different set of students were observed. Students also perceived that using gamification in classroom provide enjoyable and fun environment, attractive and exciting, besides enhancing knowledge. Students also perceived that gamification activity increases participation, improving motivation, creating competition, developing teamwork and bonding between students and instructor and should be conducted more. Application: The results of this study may be beneficial to students in term of new technique used in teaching and learning process through enhancement of knowledge circulation from lecturers to students or between the students themselves. The results may also heighten the awareness of instructors in identifying alternative tools besides conducting traditional lectures. The results also may encourage administrators in helping the instructors towards upgrading their teaching methods and performance using latest applications for the purpose of improving students’ engagement.

Our program's prior AC had residents learning in isolation, achieving completion via quizzes before advancing without the benefit of deliberate knowledge reinforcement. We sought to increase engagement and spaced repetition by creating a social AC using gamification. Methods: We created a website featuring monthly options from textbooks and open-access medical education. Residents selected four hours of material, and then submitted learning points. Using these learning points, trivia competitions were created. Residents competed in teams as ""houses"" during didactic conference, allowing for spaced repetition. Residents who were late in completing AC assignments caused their ""house"" to lose points, thus encouraging timely completion. Results: Completion rates prior to deadline are now >95% compared to ~30% before intervention.

Using ICT in education was always a challenge to enhance learning, especially when it comes to using web 2.0 elements that include blogging. The paper explores the following aspects: (1) Combining gamification elements in class blogs, adding extra enhancements to learning which can be reflected in the student’s blogs posts and can be measured using Google analytics and (2) Using quality management tools and creativity techniques to ensure quality for each stage of teacher/student blogging cycle.

In this article, after providing a historical overview of educational gamification, a novel methodology is proposed based on the use of one of these serious games, specifically the tool Quizizz. This online tool is open access and free, which encourages teachers to reproduce the proposed methodology for their subjects. The methodological proposal is based on three principles: (i) the use of virtual resources in education; (Ii) the effectiveness of collaborative learning; and (iii) the motivation that the gamification of the teaching-learning process awakens in students. The effectiveness of the methodology has been demonstrated by surveys to the students carried out before (pre-test) and after (post-test) an educational experience at two pre-university levels: Junior High School and High School. In the light of the results obtained, it has become evident that the proposed methodology favors: (i) the teaching-learning process, by raising the level of student engagement in the study of the subject; (ii) the resolution of multiple-choice tests with a more optimistic approach and self-confidence; (iii) students’ greater predisposition for team work; and (iv) an entertaining and motivating educational environment. © 2019 Grupo de Investigacion FORCE.

Programming is difficult for students to learn, given that it includes a lot of new, complex, and abstract topics. All of this has led experts to the conclusion that new teaching techniques are required if students are to be motivated and engaged in learning on programming courses. Gamification has come to be an effective technique in education in general, and is especially useful in programming courses. This motivated us to develop an open source gamified platform, called UDPiler, for use in a programming course. Objective: The main goal of this article is to obtain empirical evidence on the improvement of students' learning performance when using UDPiler in comparison to a non-gamified compiler. Method: A quasi-experiment was performed with two groups of first-year engineering students at Diego Portales University in Chile, using a non-gamified compiler and a gamified platform, respectively. Results: The results reveal that the students obtained better marks when the gamified platform was used to learn C programming. In addition, there is statistical significance in favor of there being a positive effect on the learning performance of those students who used the gamified platform. Conclusions: The results allow us to conclude that gamification is an encouraging approach with which to teach C programming, a finding that is aligned with previous empirical studies concerning gamification on programming courses, carried out in academic contexts. Nonetheless, we are aware that further validation is also required to corroborate and strengthen the findings obtained and to investigate whether the kind of gamified elements (mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics) used have any influence on students' performance, among other issues that deserve further investigation and that are explained throughout this article. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.";"Gamification; Programming courses; Quasi-experiment; Undergraduate education";"Abstracting; Open source software; Program compilers; Students; Teaching; Empirical investigation; First-year engineering; Gamification; Learning performance; Programming course; Quasi-experiments; Statistical significance; Undergraduate education; C (programming language)";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

In the last few years, gamification has been widely used to improve learning experiences in various environments. Education is one of the fields that adopted gamification as technological innovation to increase student engagement since it plays a critical role in higher education, especially in digital learning environments. Today, learning management systems (LMSs) are commonly used to facilitate learning processes. However, the engagement and the motivation of students when using such systems require extra attention. There is a need for an instructor to incorporate digital technologies with esteemed innovations to create an engaging learning environment. Increasing students' engagement is said to be evidence of increased learning. Therefore, this paper addresses these challenges by designing, developing, and evaluating a gamified collaborative discussion environment on the moodle LMS. To achieve this, the students in a postgraduate course used a gamified online discussion environment for eight weeks during group work to complete their term projects. Students' online learning pre-test and post-test data are utilized to investigate students' engagement in a gamified discussion environment. The results illustrate that there is a significant difference between pre-test and post-test results, which shows that the gamified online discussion environment has improved students' engagement. Furthermore, students that highly accessed the online course activities had a good engagement, which motivated students to conduct online collaboration according to the game-feature context. © 2013 IEEE.";"collaborative environment; Gamification; moodle; online discussion environment";"Computer aided instruction; Curricula; E-learning; Social networking (online); Teaching; Collaborative environments; Digital learning environment; Gamification; Higher education institutions; Learning management system; moodle; Online discussions; Technological innovation; Students";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold";"Scopus"

People with hearing loss use sign language to communicate with others and to help them in their learning process. For this study, an interview and survey were conducted with teachers and students from SK Pendidikan Khas Melaka and few problems have been identified in the learning spectrum of children with hearing disability. They face difficulties in learning due to the lack of exposure about the correct sign language since young, difficulty in interpreting sign language in the conventional teaching material due to the nature of its static image contents, and hearing loss children are also usuallyless focused in the learning process and are easily distracted by their surroundings when the class is in session. To solve these problems, i-Sign is developed as a learning application that incorporates simple gamification in its development that could help hearing loss children to learn the alphabet and basic words of sign language. The use of gamification and multimedia elements provide a more interactive and fun learning environment for the students instead of using static contents, and are also used to direct students' attention to the learning activity making them more focused in the learning process. i-Sign was developed using the ADDIE model which includes the Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation phases. In the evaluation phase, a usability test was conducted on 8 children with hearing loss to test theacceptance of the user towards this application and 91.89% of the respondents found that the application meets their expectation of the application capability in terms of its effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction. This shows that gamification can be used as an alternativelearning material for hearing loss children and help expose the correct sign language to them.The application can also be used by the public that wants to learn about sign language. © UiTM Press.";"Game and education; Gamification; Hearing loss; Learning application; Sign language; Special education";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Another biggest motive behind the authors for combining these two techniques is the fact that eCommerce is a business vertical or a market place where people from all walks of life participate in online purchases. eCommerce is not a market place where it is restricted to one particular community, region, age, colour etc., So to interact, involve and conduct the business operations with an inclusive mindset, the authors thought that it would be appropriate to gamify and pooling the resources such that there would be a perfect blend of resources with utmost motivation to serve all the stakeholders, irrespective of their age, gender, community, region, economic status, in ecommerce. It turned out to be a practical solution as it proved to be promoting an atmosphere that fosters friendship and loyalty, and these close-knit relationships motivate employees; align them to work much harder, cooperate and be supportive to each other. This is possible because every individual possesses diverse talents, weaknesses, communication skills, strengths, habits, and hence it is optimally balanced out. Gamification is a method to enhance employee engagement, behavioral change and motivation. Application of gamification is not limited to eCommerce business models, but can be applied to various other business models in the sectors like education, research, healthcare etc. So also, the human resource pooling is building and grouping of human resources for best use to improve the operational efficiency and reduce the costs. The human resource pooling can happen during fine tuning of a cultural fit, organization mergers, change in organization structure, technological changes and on acquiring new technology. In this study we have considered a group of 120 employees who were further divided to 6 functional groups, having 20 employees in each functional group. In this paper we report the outcome of application of gamification and resource pooling techniques and benefits in an eCommerce industry. © IAEME Publication";"Behavioural change; Employees; Gamification; Motivation; Resource pooling";"";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Bronze";"Scopus"

However, despite the rapid change in our technology, lifestyle and needs in the workforce, it has failed to adapt accordingly. The current system relies heavily on industrial-age values where students are expected to follow instructions and are stripped of their agency rather than being encouraged to actively participate in their learning process. As a result, students end up lacking motivation and engagement. Persuasive design focuses on influencing human behavior to improve long-term engagement through various mechanisms. Here, we have embedded the design in the form of gamification elements intothe classroom mechanic to aid in the assessment and modulation of student behavior. ""ExP"", a points-based incentive system tied to all aspects of the classroom mechanics was designed to work in tandem with existing student behavior. Accurate balancing of the system effectively grants students agency and allows more clarity in their classroom interactions and stratagem. The study assesses the effectiveness of the system in improving the academic performance of Diploma-level students. A group of 21 repeating students was observed for an entire semester. A paired sample t-test using SPSS was performed to draw the results.

Gamification in the classroom consists in the use of the game designed mechanically and structurally to teach through game(s). It is important to note the difference between a game and gamification. A game, which is understood as a finished product and something concrete, unlike the gamification part of a didactic content which may be defined as an activity that contains the elements found in a spirit of play. Through this innovative methodology, effort is rewarded and valued, not only achievement, through the use of badges. Through this methodology, the game is treated as a motivating element in the classroom, and moreover it is a methodology which is considered as an active one because the student must be active and be the main character in the learning process. METHOD. This work involves the translation and validation of a GAMEX scale (Gameful Experience in Gamification) that measures the gamified experience in English and German. The sample consists of 224 participants related to education and gamified experiences (52% teachers and 48% students). Exploratory factor analysis (AFE) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were carried out to confirm the dimensional structure of the scale. RESULTS. The results show the complexity of evaluating gamified experiences from a unique and valid perspective, since several dimensions come into play. There are valid instruments that do not take into account all dimensions, and this proposed instrument shows a higher acceptable level of adjustment than the original model. DISCUSSION. The multi-dimensional nature of the gamified experience is emphasized and the need to create an instrument to evaluate it and improve future gamified experiences is highlighted. © Sociedad Española de Pedagogía.";"Construct validity; Educational games; Learning motivation; Questionnaires; Teaching methods";"";"Spanish";"Article";"All Open Access, Bronze";"Scopus"

Along with the indisputable advantages of this technology for the learning process, there are a number of difficulties in its implementation. The research problem is the search for ways to increase the efficiency of using the flipped classroom technology in the educational process. The methodological basis of the study included the main provisions of the system-activity approach, the essence of which lies in the fact that in the educational process, the central and system-forming factor is the activity and methods of its implementation. In accordance with this approach, a sequence of activities has been built for first-year university students, aimed at achieving the planned learning outcomes. The novelty of the study lies in the fact that the principles of gamification are applied within a certain pedagogical technology with the aim of forming cognitive functions that are in demand in modern society. The data of the pedagogical experiment on the described technology for organizing the educational process are presented by the example of studying the topic “Information Security”. Based on the results of the experiment, as well as data analysis using the χ2-Pearson criterion, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is proved both in terms of increasing the degree of formation of the relevant competencies and in terms of cognitive and personal development of students. Recommendations on the gamification of the educational process using the “flipped classroom” technology have been formulated, which can be used to change traditional methodological training systems in order to achieve modern educational results. © 2019 LLC Ecological Help.

The Australian-based app uses gamification to encourage users to participate in ‘bystander anti-racism’. However, by failing to question the neutrality of the default white bystander, the app risks reproducing hegemonic constellations of white agency versus racialized inaction. I argue that, in the zone of appearance, it is not enough to make racism apparent. It is necessary to appear. To appear first requires exposing nonappearance including the role even of the well-intentioned in maintaining it. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.";"antiracism apps; appearance; embodiment; everyday racism; looking; Whiteness";"education; racial disparity; racial identity; racial segregation; racism; Australia";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Global populations live increasingly in urban landscapes, which creates an ‘extinction of experience’ when interacting with nature. In 2018, we facilitated 8 workshops with students aged 13 to 17 from two Maori immersion schools (Wharekura) to explore the application and implementation of a cultural monitoring framework. Although initial workshops demonstrated it was possible to apply the cultural monitoring method across ecosystems, the absence of basic ecological literacy was a significant challenge. We observed that uptake and understanding of basic environmental knowledge and ecological literacy increased markedly when we used gamification. We tested the potential of technology to enable pro-environmental behaviour and increase environmental literacy and indigenous knowledge to support student’s connection to the natural world. Over the duration of this study, we developed a basic New Zealand ecology game, called Eko. The game fuses basic ecological concepts with indigenous Maori knowledge to provide a holistic view of the environment. Our survey results show that 90% of the students found our game entertaining, while 65% reported new knowledge acquisition. Our research revealed that while ‘extinction of experience’ in this area is rising globally, technology can be used as a mechanism to facilitate an increase in ecological literacy, indigenous knowledge, and pro-environmental behaviours. Our challenge in reversing the disconnection between our youth and the natural world is to explore the void between environment, technology, and indigenous knowledge. People should therefore be encouraged to explore how technological innovation can augment holistic solutions when connecting youth with their natural world. © 2019 New Zealand Ecological Society.";"Digital platforms; Ecosystems; Environmental education; Environmental literacy; Gamification; Kaitiakitanga; Kaupapa Maori; Matauranga Maori; Pro-environmental behaviours";"biomonitoring; ecosystem approach; environmental education; holistic approach; indigenous knowledge; innovation; literacy; technology; New Zealand";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Bronze";"Scopus"

Many experts rightly paid attention to the effectiveness of using games in the learning process. Despite the attractiveness for teachers and students, until recently, game approaches as a form of education have remained on the periphery of the educational process, being just a supplement to the main methods. Only role-playing games can be called an exception, with their being included both in the educational process of school and university education, and in professional-oriented training of specialists. However, under the influence of processes in modern culture and the active development of gaming technology, the ""gamification"" of education acquires the character of a mass phenomenon both at school and in higher educational institutions, and ignoring these processes is not only impossible but impractical.

Increasingly sophisticated technological systems are steering societies into a new era that makes technology a very important tool. Children's minds are highly susceptible to technology enabling them to become skilful in using gadgets and in surfing the internet. However, the teaching and learning in classrooms still adopt traditional or conventional methods. This paper aims to critically examine the development of the portable application named Global Zakāt Game (GZG) as one of the initiatives to help increase the level of education in Malaysia so that it will be in line with the development of information technology and communication today. The use of this application will also help teachers to disseminate universal values such as charity and raise awareness of issues such as the quest for peace both within the nation and globally, among people of different nations. A qualitative methodology was employed to analyse data using the inductive and deductive approach. The findings show that the GZG application could help students to understand the values of charity in zakat well, although it is only played online. This is because GZG encompasses almost the whole zakat syllabus including types of zakāt, the rate of zakāt, the calculation of zakāt, and questions related to zakāt. The education system should not lag behind in the use of technology and should upgrade its teaching-learning methodologies in line with the increasing sophistication of technology today. Through modern education awareness of global peace and values such as charity can be instilled and inculcated in the young.

This article reports on the development and validation of a unified, comprehensive framework for evaluating the efficacy of games in teaching sexual health behaviors for curbing unhealthy sexual outcomes to secondary school adolescents in low resource settings. Methods: The initial validation of the MAKE framework was administered to 120 students using quantitative data collection and analysis. It was then subjected to factor analysis tests to investigate the items’ structure, and Cronbach’s alpha was applied to measure the scale reliability using SPSS Version 24. Results: Data analyses demonstrate that the MAKE framework is a comprehensive instrument to evaluate teaching methods with four powerful constructs, each of which has two to four components. For each construct, the following data were obtained: for motivation, standardized alpha = 0.92, Kaiser-Meyer- Olkin (KMO) = 0.88, and p = 0.001; for attitude, standardized Cronbach’s alpha = 0.90, KMO = 0.88, and p = 0.001; for knowledge, standardized alpha = 0.92, KMO = 0.86, and p = 0.001; and finally, for engagement, standardized alpha = 0.90, KMO = 0.87, and p = 0.001. Cronbach’s alpha for each component was above the cut-off point (0.65). Conclusions: This study shows that the MAKE framework is a satisfactory instrument for assessing the efficacy of teaching methods for sexual health literacy in a variety of teaching environments. The method may also have value for assessing the effectiveness of other methods in adolescent sexual health education. © 2019 The Author(s).";"";"adolescent; article; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; Cronbach alpha coefficient; data analysis software; drug efficacy; factor analysis; female; human; human experiment; literacy; major clinical study; male; motivation; quantitative analysis; sexual health; student; teaching; validation process; attitude to health; child; education; health education; health literacy; motivation; procedures; sexual education; sexual health; Tanzania; video game; Adolescent; Child; Educational Measurement; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Health Education; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Literacy; Humans; Male; Motivation; Sex Education; Sexual Health; Tanzania; Video Games";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

The success of these systems relies on engaging experience and timely and accurate feedback to the students on their performance. Still, these systems suffer from high student dropouts, often due to a lack of personalization in student interactions. While students show different collaborative behavior, i.e., some students are social, and like discussions, while others are self-oriented and do not participate in any collaborative activity, the feedback and interactions with students are generally not customized based on their type of collaborative behavior.

Design: The authors designed an Escape Room combining Vascular Surgery objectives, knowledge-based problems and technical skills into Vascular Surgery-themed stations. Groups of 3 to 4 medical students participated in the activity. Data collected included time to escape, CanMEDS roles covered during the activity, debriefing interview session, and satisfaction survey. Setting: The Escape Room was installed at the University of Ottawa Skills and Simulation Centre at the Ottawa Hospital, a tertiary care center. Participants: Medical students in their preclerkship years of study were invited to participate in the Escape Room. In total, 13 medical students completed the experience, divided into 4 groups. Results: Thirteen medical students divided into 4 groups participated in the Escape Room. Two teams used a collaborative strategy to complete the activity and successfully escaped with an average time of 53.6 minutes, whereas only 1 of the 2 teams completing the experience employing an individualistic strategy successfully escaped. Following the experience, 83% of participants stated that the experience motivated them to prepare beforehand and believed that the experience consolidated the knowledge that they had read. All the participants also reported that the experience encouraged the use of the CanMEDS communicator and collaborator roles. As well, 76.9% of students mentioned that they enjoyed the practical exercises incorporated into the experience and 53.8% stated that they would like to see the Escape Room format included in the medical curriculum.

As an alternative, the ‘Escape Room’ teaching game is a much more dynamic option to asses theoretical and practical knowledge, and it may also promote teamwork and the ability to perform under pressure. Objectives: To analyse nursing students’ opinions and study motivations after using the nursing ‘Escape Room’ teaching game. Design: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Participants: Second-year nursing students enrolled in the ‘Adult Nursing 1’ subject. Method: After completing the teaching game, the students who had taken part in it were asked to fill in an ad-hoc questionnaire on the matter. In this game, students have 30 min in which they must solve the riddles and puzzles presented, and thus escape. In doing so, they must demonstrate both theoretical and practical knowledge, and a teacher will remain in the classroom to assess whether the nursing techniques in question are correctly performed. Results: The nursing students who took part in the game strongly believed that this ‘helped them learn the subject’ (4.8 points) and that ‘more games of this type should be included in their nursing studies’ (4.8 points). Overall, they considered that ‘the game was enjoyable’ (4.6 points), ‘helped them in the exam’ (4.6 points), and ‘motivated them to study’ (4.5 points). Conclusions: The ‘Escape Room’ is a useful game; it stimulates learning, is fun to play, and motivates studying. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd";"Escape Room; Game-based learning; Gamification; Nursing students; Students; Teaching; University";"adult; article; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; motivation; nursing student; questionnaire; teacher; teaching; theoretical study; attitude; cross-sectional study; motivation; nursing education; nursing student; procedures; psychology; recreational game; standards; teaching; Adult; Attitude; Cross-Sectional Studies; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Female; Games, Recreational; Humans; Male; Motivation; Students, Nursing; Surveys and Questionnaires; Teaching";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

The notion of ontologies and the association of concepts in relevance to decisions that have to be made is used. The current work introduces a new process-based approach, based on collected large log files and associations of underlying decisions based on them. Both of them deal with work in extracting information for intelligent use, the main difference being that the first discovers but stops on a concept relation basis, while the other based on processes, as knowledge transactions, further to the associations on a 1:1 level maybe applied on a multi associative model. The objective of the current work is to introduce the methodology into gamified environments (such as but not limited to) games, for semi-automated understanding of user behaviour and furthermore, prediction and in instances, guidance via optimal paths of decision making activities, that are useful in gamified applications in various areas like the education. Both the initial ontology based, and the extension work on it, are based on mining association rules, in one instance treated as knowledge nodes (concepts) and in the second as underlying knowledge processes, based on big log files. This may be applicable to online games, that generate big log files of user selections, that are available for study and examination for extracting user behavioural patterns. As a result, maximum length of sequential patterns and items in them, are discovered in an algorithmic based methodological approach, providing in this way a set of guidelines for designing gamified applications. © 2019 ASTES Publishers.

The impact and consequences of this innovative technology have not yet been satisfactory explored. This empirical study investigated the cognitive and social aspects of collaboration in a shared, immersive virtual reality. A unique application for implementing a collaborative immersive virtual environment (CIVE) was developed by our interdisciplinary team as a software solution for educational purposes, with two scenarios for learning about hypsography, i.e., explanations of contour line principles. Both scenarios allow switching between a usual 2D contour map and a 3D model of the corresponding terrain to increase the intelligibility and clarity of the educational content. Gamification principles were also applied to both scenarios to augment user engagement during the completion of tasks. A qualitative research approach was adopted to obtain a deep insight into the lived experience of users in a CIVE. It was thus possible to form a deep understanding of very new subject matter. Twelve pairs of participants were observed during their CIVE experience and then interviewed either in a semistructured interview or a focus group. Data from these three research techniques were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis, which is research method for studying individual experience. Four superordinate themes-with detailed descriptions of experiences shared by numerous participants-emerged as results from the analysis; we called these (1) Appreciation for having a collaborator, (2) The Surprising ""Fun with Maps"", (3) Communication as a challenge, and (4) Cognition in two realities.

The solution to this problem is considered from the perspective of organizational measures and cybernetic methods, and the personal learning environment is regarded as a tool. The study aims to reveal the possibility and feasibility of using this environment as a tool to improve students' performance. For this purpose, the relationship between students' use of a personal learning environment and their academic performance in the educational process was determined by the methods of clustering and mathematical statistics. Students who use the tools of the personal learning environment have a higher average grade, are more successful in interim attestations, less frequently retake examinations or are expelled due to academic failures. The study resulted in identifying four clusters of students with pronounced characteristics, representing independent groups of students, to which a certain organizational impact can be applied to improve academic performance. The possibility of flexible use of tools of the personal learning environment (ratings, achievements, signs, and active notifications) to influence students from different clusters is shown. From the perspective of the educational process, these tools are auxiliary because they are not used directly for training, but make it possible to discipline students, to increase self-organization and interest in the learning process. As a result, students' performance and the effectiveness of the activity of the educational organization in general are improved. © 2019 LLC Ecological Help.

National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds competitive, investigator-initiated grant applications. Funded grants represent the state of the science and therefore are expected to anticipate the progression of research in the near future. Objective: The objective of this paper is to provide an analysis of the kinds of smartphone-based intervention apps funded in NIH research grants during the five-year period between 2014 and 2018. Methods: We queried NIH Reporter to identify candidate funded grants that addressed mHealth and the use of smartphones. From 1524 potential grants, we identified 397 that met the requisites of including an intervention app. Each grant’s abstract was analyzed to understand the focus of intervention. The year of funding, type of activity (eg, R01, R34, and so on) and funding were noted. Results: We identified 13 categories of strategies employed in funded smartphone intervention apps. Most grants included either one (35.0%) or two (39.0%) intervention approaches. These included artificial intelligence (57 apps), bionic adaptation (33 apps), cognitive and behavioral therapies (68 apps), contingency management (24 apps), education and information (85 apps), enhanced motivation (50 apps), facilitating, reminding and referring (60 apps), gaming and gamification (52 apps), mindfulness training (18 apps), monitoring and feedback (192 apps), norm setting (7 apps), skills training (85 apps) and social support and social networking (59 apps). The most frequently observed grant types included Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) grants (40.8%) and Research Project Grants (R01s) (26.2%). The number of grants funded increased through the five-year period from 60 in 2014 to 112 in 2018. Conclusions: Smartphone intervention apps are increasingly competitive for NIH funding.

At present, the general issues of humanization and pedagogical and methodological support of the educational process are of great importance in light of the need to increase the academic mobility of university graduates who choose to work at universities. The problem of insufficient level of their psychological and pedagogical competence development arises automatically. Psychological and pedagogical competence of a graduate means his (her) ability to mastering the basic material of the psychological and pedagogical unit, the ability to operate the acquired knowledge and put it into practice, mastering acquired skills in the conditions of concrete professional and pedagogical activity. This problem has several solutions. One of the most effective is the possibility of developing and introducing the programmes of advanced psychological and pedagogical training and professional retraining for future engineers specializing in engineering pedagogy. The purpose of the article is to view the effective approaches to the development of psychological and pedagogical competences among future engineers. The authors consider using of the modern IT-technologies to be a strong motivator in this process as well as gamification (role games and business games). As the key tasks of the teaching staff at technical university the following issues are regarded: creation of conditions for the disclosure by future engineers of their professional and personal resources; obtaining by future engineers the information necessary to increase the level of their psychological and pedagogical competence; acquisition of skills necessary for knowledge application in future professional activity; expanding the range of professional competencies of future engineers in the conditions of psychological and pedagogical design. One of the most important aspects of teacher’s activity is reflection, self-evaluation. The authors present teachers’ behavior patterns for reflection and formulate the recommendations for teaching future engineering teachers. Thus, the specificity of training future engineers with the focus on increasing their psychological and pedagogical competence is a complex multi-faceted process, specially organized in time and space, involving consideration of certain psychological and pedagogical, methodological and methodical patterns and aimed at developing professional qualifications of future engineering pedagogues. © 2019 Moscow Polytechnic University.

Within a Māori (indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand) worldview, genomic data obtained from taonga (treasured) species has whakapapa – generally defined as genealogy, whakapapa layers the contemporary, historical and mythological aspects of bioheritage – thus genomic data obtained from taonga species are taonga in their own right and are best studied using Māori principles. We contend it is the responsibility of researchers working with genomic data from taonga species to move beyond one-off Māori consultation toward building meaningful relationships with relevant Māori communities. Here, we reflect on our experience embedding Māori principles in genomics research as leaders of a BioHeritage National Science Challenge project entitled ‘Characterising adaptive variation in Aotearoa New Zealand’s terrestrial and freshwater biota’. We are co-developing a culturallyresponsive evidence-based position statement regarding the benefits and risks of prioritising adaptive potential to build resilience in threatened taonga species, including species destined for customary or commercial harvest. To achieve this, we co-developed a research programme with the local subtribe, Ngāi Tūāhuriri, that integrates Māori knowledge with emerging genomic technologies and extensive ecological data for two taonga species, kōwaro (Canterbury mudfish; Neochanna burrowsius) and kēkēwai (freshwater crayfish; Paranephrops zealandicus). The foundation of our research programme is an iterative decision-making framework that includes tissue sampling as well as data generation, storage and access. Beyond upholding the promises made in The Treaty of Waitangi, we contend the integration of Māori principles in genomics research will enhance the recovery of taonga species and enable the realisation of Māori values. © 2019 New Zealand Ecological Society.";"Digital platforms; Ecosystems; Environmental education; Environmental literacy; Gamification; Kaitiakitanga; Kaupapa Maori; Matauranga Maori; Pro-environmental behaviours";"crayfish; digital mapping; ecosystem management; environmental education; genomics; indigenous population; physiology; research work; Canterbury [South Island]; New Zealand; South Island; Astacoidea; Neochanna burrowsius; Paranephrops zealandicus; Waro";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Bronze, Green";"Scopus"

The experiment involved the students of two universities doing the elective course ""Do Better Your Leadership Skills Up"". Having been split up into two halves, the first part of the focus group used the traditional forms of educational process, while the second one additionally used the software like CogniFit, Lumosity, BrainHQ, NeuroNation, Brain Metrix, Eidetic, Fit Brains, BrainExer 2.0. At the entry stage, the pedagogic surveys had been used as well as the cognitive function test to study the cognitive capabilities of the focus group students. We used a multi method approach of combining the close-ended and open-ended questions to get the feedback and the above cognitive test to measure the output of the study. Quantitative methods had been used to analyze the data and such Covariance-based Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) software as SPSS AMOS had been applied to evaluate the results because cognitive function of a person includes sub-components of latent constructs. Textalyzer software had been used to process the students' responses to open-ended questions of the questionnaire for the most commonly used positive words in the texts, which helped us to identify broad categories of responses. Here, the most commonly used words we had distinguished were ""involvement"", ""improvement"", ""gamification"", ""motivation"", ""speed"", ""concentration"", ""memory"", ""current studies"", ""future job"". Then we distributed the answers by the frequency of the identified words. The responses, which fell under no category, had been analyzed manually. The experimentally obtained data shows that integration of the smart technology into traditional learning environment increases students' involvement by 23%, personal transformation by 18% and motivation by 17%. Our study proves that the convergent mode of instruction brings more benefits to the students in terms of fostering cognitive aspects of leadership competencies in the process of vocational training than the traditional mode. We found that the converged pedagogical mode enhances the collaboration and involvement of all the stakeholders of educational process. It makes students achieve the greatest personal satisfaction through enhanced self-esteem, efficiency gains, a sense of continuous personal achievement and enhanced autonomy and experimenting with their own learning strategies. We suggest universities (of Ukraine, specifically) to provide training to the teachers with all the latest technology, which seems essential for teaching. Academic institutions (of Ukraine) should also invest into research in the area of the educationalpurpose use of smart technology. © 2019 Lifescience Global.";"Cognitive skills of leadership; Smart technology; Tertiary institution; Traditional mode of education; Vocational training";"achievement; adult; article; brain; cognitive function test; controlled study; data analysis software; female; human; human experiment; leadership; learning environment; male; memory; motivation; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; satisfaction; self esteem; skill; structural equation modeling; student; teacher; teaching; Ukraine; velocity; vocational education";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold";"Scopus"

However, most of the currently available nutrition apps lack scientific evaluation and user acceptance. Objective: The objective of this study was the systematic design of a theory-driven and target group–adapted dietary mobile app concept to promote healthy eating habits with a focus on drinking habits as well as consumption of fruits and vegetables in adolescents and young adults, especially from disadvantaged backgrounds. Methods: The design process was guided by the behavior change wheel (BCW). The development process comprised 3 stages. In stage 1, the target behavior was specified, and facilitators and barriers were identified. Furthermore, important insights into target group interests, needs, and values in the field of nutrition and apps were revealed. To this end, 2 empirical studies were conducted with the target group. In stage 2, results of stage 1 were translated into behavior change techniques (BCTs) and, finally, into app functionalities and features. Consequently, in stage 3, the concept was evaluated and optimized through expert interviews. Results: Facilitators and barriers for achieving the target behavior were psychological capabilities (eg, self-efficacy), reflective motivation (eg, fitness), automatic motivation, social support, and physical opportunity (eg, time). Target group interests, needs, and values in the field of nutrition were translated into target group preferences for app usage, for example, low usage effort, visual feedback, or recipes. Education, training, incentives, persuasion, and enablement were identified as relevant intervention functions. Together with the target group preferences, these were translated via 14 BCTs, such as rewards, graded tasks, or self-monitoring into the app concept Challenge to go (C2go). The expert evaluation suggested changes of some app features for improving adherence, positive health effects, and technical feasibility. The C2go concept comprises 3 worlds: the (1) drinking, (2) vegetable, and (3) fruit worlds. In each world, the users are faced with challenges including feedback and a quiz. Tips were developed based on the health action process approach and to help users gain challenges and, thereby, achieve the target behavior. Challenges can be played alone or against someone in the community. Due to different activities, points can be collected, and levels can be achieved. Collected points open access to an Infothek (information section), where users can choose content that interests them. An avatar guides user through the app. Conclusions: C2go is aimed at adolescents and young adults and aims to improve their fruit and vegetable consumption as well as drinking habits. It is a theory-driven and target group–adapted dietary mobile intervention concept that uses gamification and was systematically developed using the BCW. © Anna Rohde, Anja Duensing, Christine Dawczynski, Jasmin Godemann, Stefan Lorkowski, Christine Brombach.";"Adolescents; Health behavior; Healthy eating; MHealth; Mobile apps; Mobile phone; Motivation; Young adults";"adolescent; behavior therapy; devices; equipment design; feeding behavior; female; fruit; human; male; mobile application; procedures; psychology; sociological theory; system analysis; vegetable; young adult; Adolescent; Behavior Therapy; Equipment Design; Feeding Behavior; Female; Fruit; Humans; Male; Mobile Applications; Social Theory; Systems Analysis; Vegetables; Young Adult";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

At the core of these changes is the pervasiveness of learning technology. This papers aims to propose a model for the selection and adoption of emerging learning technologies to enhance learning within the context of higher education. Design/methodology/approach: Higher education institutions are resorting to the deployment of learning technologies to address the demands of the twenty-first century learners and to ascertain their competitiveness. This paper draws from the literature to provide a model, composed of five key characteristics of learning, to support the selection and adoption of emerging learning technologies. Findings: The model posits that the attainment of each of these five characteristics, personalised, ubiquitous, collaborative, lifelong and authentic needs to be supported by corresponding technologies: adaptive learning technologies, artificial intelligence, mobile technology, social technology, massive open online courses, virtual and augmented reality, gamification and the Internet of Things. Originality/value: Higher education is progressively being displaced from the traditional classroom, and as it progresses towards online settings, it requires the support of technology to facilitate that transference. In examining the potential of future learning technologies, this paper contributes to a growing body of research that focuses on the benefits of technology within higher education and assists educators in the selection and adoption of the most relevant technologies. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.";"Collaborative learning; Higher education; Learning technologies; Lifelong learning; Personalized learning; Ubiquitous learning";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

It has been enthusiastically employed in various fields such as web-based businesses, health, wellness, and has been widely researched in the field of education. While many of the pioneer studies revealed positive effects of gamification for learning, more inconclusive and even negative effects have been reported in subsequent research. It is also uncertain whether the positive outcomes are sustainable and not limited to just novelty effects. Studies in this field continue to mature and the thrust is to move beyond the preliminary and often vague question of “Does gamification work?” to more specific inquiries like “Why does gamification work?”, “What is gamification’s effect?” or “How to make gamification work?” In order for the knowledge gains from research studies to be synthesizable, there has been a call for gamification approaches to be based upon established psychological, behavioural or learning theories instead of ad hoc methods. This paper responds to this need by presenting a gamification framework that is based on the well-established motivational theory, the Self-Determination Theory (SDT). The SDT addresses motivation through the distinction of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. In order to foster authentic learning motivations, gamification should be designed to affect intrinsic motivation for the learning activity itself. This paper outlines how this can be achieved by strategically employing game dynamics and components to meet the psychological needs that support intrinsic motivation. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.";"Autonomy; Competence; Gamification; Motivation; Relatedness; Self-determination theory";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

A variety of methodologies have been published for developing gamification. However, some of these are only usable by people with a certain level of gamification knowledge. People who do not have such knowledge face difficulty in using game mechanics and experiencing enjoyment. To ease their difficulties, a gamification methodology should provide directions for using game mechanics. Objective: This study aimed at collecting global gamification cases and determining patterns or differences among the collected cases. Methods: In total, 754 cases were collected based on 4F process elements, such as play type, playful user experience (PLEX)–based fun factors, and game mechanics. In addition, the collected cases were classified into 6 categories. From the data analysis, basic statistics and correlation analyses (Pearson and Kendall) were conducted. Results: According to the analysis results in PLEX-based fun factors, challenge and completion fun factors formed a large proportion among the 6 categories. In the results of the game mechanics analysis, point, leaderboard, and progress accounted for a large proportion among the 6 categories. The results of the correlation analysis showed no difference or specific patterns in game mechanics (Pearson r>.8, Kendall τ>.5, P<.05) and PLEX-based fun factors (Pearson r>.8, Kendall τ>.7, P<.05). Conclusions: On the basis of the statistical findings, this study suggests an appropriate number of PLEX-based fun factors and game mechanics.

SonoGames is a competitive games-based event designed to educate and inspire emergency medicine (EM) residents about point-of-care ultrasound. We sought to describe: (1) the perceived effectiveness of a competitive event on both immediate learning and longterm education; and (2) the resultant attitudes of participants and program directors regarding ultrasound training. Methods—The SonoGames Organizational Committee designed 2 surveys: 1 for SonoGames V EM resident participants and a second for EM program directors. Survey questions used a 5-point Likert scale to assess overall perceptions and attitudes about ultrasound, changes in self-reported content knowledge and competency, effects on clinical use, and perceived impacts of a competitive game format on education. Results—Seventy-three resident participants and 42 program directors responded to the survey. Ninety-four percent of participants thought that the competitive gaming format of SonoGames was effective in making the event an educational experience. Participants reported that their ultrasound knowledge increased (81%), their enthusiasm for ultrasound increased (87%), and their clinical use of ultrasound increased (61%). Residency program directors reported similar increases to a lesser degree. Greater advancement through the event was associated with more positive responses. Residencies that participated in the event saw greater increases in the use of ultrasound by residents than those that did not. Conclusions—A competitive games-based educational event focused on point-ofcare ultrasound is an effective educational tool.

The use of games for serious purposes is strategy that dates back to the beginning of humankind. Objectives: The following article will outline the evolutionary lines of Serious Games, starting with the first traces of games in human history up to the present. In-depth consideration of factors influencing the development of Serious Games in the past and present outline possible future developments and may lead to a better understanding of today’s developments. Materials and methods: The present work is a narrative review and outlines the most important developments of games. The development of Serious Games for Health will be considered in more detail. The various influencing factors from the entertainment and military sectors are outlined as well as new technologies that change the use of games for serious purposes. Results: The development of Serious Games in the history of humankind is shown in a timeline. Games with a serious intention have been part of the culture since the beginning of humanity. Serious Games is not a new technology trigger, but has always been closely linked to learning. Various factors influencing the development of Serious Games have led to a very diverse, interprofessional and interdisciplinary field of research and application. Conclusions: Serious Games (for Health) and playful applications like gamification offer great potential for work in prevention, health promotion, medicine and health education.

At the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, anatomy teaching has traditionally been delivered via didactic means. To encourage more active learning, suitable games (non-digital) and the script concordance test were utilized to enhance the process. The flipped classroom approach was also introduced to further trigger active learning. In addition, the use of mobile apps (digital) was also initiated as supplements for SDL. Feedback was collected based on the previously validated PRO-SDL scale. Results from the research yielded inconclusive evidence to support enhanced motivation among our students due to gamification (P > 0.05). However, it did help to encourage active participation for a “fun learning” experience supported by numerous positive comments. More importantly, the participant's continuous assessment (CA1, CA2, and CA3) and objective specific practical exam results were better than the cohort's average (P < 0.05), suggesting that enhanced meta-cognition, and factual recall had taken place. While it is positive, there are some caveats to note with gamification, first and foremost, that it is tutor dependent.

We surveyed 139 students aged 18–31 years (M = 20 years, SD = 1.5) enrolled in an undergraduate informatics course focused on social networking technologies. Surveys were conducted at 3 time points during the course (beginning, middle, and end). Overall, we found positive trends with respect to students' perceptions of gamification's impact on their learning, achievement, and engagement in the course material. Although students who played and identified variously with recreational games were more alike than not, we did uncover one notable difference with respect to how students' gaming frequency impacted their engagement in the course. Nongamers expressed somewhat less motivation to do well in the course than frequent gamers. For all other measures of engagement, however, nongamers appeared to be equally engaged by the gamified format of the course as gamers. There were virtually no differences between male and female students' perceptions of gamification. This study contributes new insight into the conditions under which gamification succeeds or fails in educational settings. These insights will be useful to designers and instructors of gamified learning environments as they seek to engage and support a variety of learners. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd";"gamification; postsecondary education; teaching/learning strategies";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

An innovative burn prevention intervention was developed using these channels. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Cool Runnings, an app-based intervention to increase knowledge of childhood burn risk (specifically hot beverage scalds) and correct burn first aid among mothers of young children. Methods: This was a 2-group, parallel, single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants were women aged 18 years and above, living in Queensland, Australia, with at Least 1 child aged 5-12 months at time of enrollment. The primary outcome measures were change in knowledge about risk of burns and correct burn first aid assessed via 2 methods: (1) overall score and (2) categorized as adequate (score=4) versus inadequate (score<4). Efficacy of gamification techniques was also assessed. Results: In total, 498 participants were recruited via social media and enrolled. At the 6-month follow-up, 244 participants completed the posttest questionnaire. Attrition rates in both groups were similar. Participants who remained in the study did not differ from those lost to follow-up on any characteristics except education level. Although similar at baseline, intervention group participants achieved significantly greater improvement in overall knowledge posttest than control group participants on both primary outcome measures (overall knowledge intervention: mean [SD] of overall knowledge 2.68 [SD 1.00] for intervention vs 2.13 [SD 1.03] for control; 20.7% [25/121] adequate in intervention vs 7.3% [2/123] in control). Consequently, the number needed to treat was 7.46. Logistic regression showed participants exposed to the highest level of disadvantage had 7.3 times higher odds of improved overall knowledge scores than participants in other levels of disadvantage. There were also significant correlations between gamification techniques and knowledge change (P<.001). In addition, odds of knowledge improvement between baseline and 6-month follow-up was higher in participants with low-moderate app activity compared with no app activity (odds ratio [OR] 8.59, 95% CI 2.9-25.02) and much higher in participants with high app activity (OR 18.26, 95% CI 7.1-46.8). Conclusions: Despite substantial loss to follow-up, this RCT demonstrates the Cool Runnings app was an effective intervention for improving knowledge about risks of hot beverage scalds and burn first aid in mothers of young children. The benefits of combining gamification elements in the intervention were also highlighted. Given the low cost and large reach of smartphone apps to deliver content to and engage with targeted populations, the results from this RCT provide important information on how smartphone apps can be used for widespread injury prevention campaigns and public health campaigns generally. © Jacqueline Burgess, Kerrianne Watt, Roy M Kimble, Cate M Cameron.";"Burns; Child; Gamification; Infant; Injury; Mobile apps; Parent; Prevention";"adult; burn; controlled study; female; health promotion; human; infant; male; newborn; procedures; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; smartphone; social media; standards; technology; telemedicine; young adult; Adult; Burns; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Smartphone; Social Media; Surveys and Questionnaires; Technology; Telemedicine; Young Adult";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

By focusing on the learning effort, this system can easily and quickly determine whether learners have exerted the minimum effort required for learning. To do this, the system automatically generates a word game and determines whether minimum learning has taken place through the results of the word game. To verify the minimum learning judgment system, we conducted a comparative experiment on the importance of high-frequency words, a word count verification test for word games, and a judgment criteria verification test based on the length of a video lecture. Results of the experiments show that high-frequency words can be used as a feature to determine minimum learning. The appropriate number of words in the word game for the minimum learning judgment was found to be seven, and the results showed that the video length did not affect the minimum learning criteria. In addition, the minimum learning judgment accuracy result was 82%.

Moreover, schools are valuable fields for teaching the principles of these concepts especially through novel methods such as gamification. ""Earthquake in the city"" was implemented in a school in Tehran, Iran, and its effectiveness on learning the concepts of professional commitment was evaluated. ""Earthquake in the city"" was built based upon a fantasy scenario occurring in an imaginary city. Each student took on a role in the city (citizen or healthcare provider). After finishing the game, participants were asked about the concept of professional commitment. Their definition was scored by a group of medical ethics experts separately in terms of compliance with the actual definitions and compared with their peers in the control group who did not participate in the game. A group of 16-year-old teenagers studying in the 11th grade participated in this intervention. The average score of conformity with the actual concept of professional commitment among the case group participants was significantly higher than the average value for the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The results of this study could provide insights to planners and educators engaged in the education system so that gamification can be incorporated as an influential tool to teach the concepts of professional commitment. This experience can also be generalized to other concepts, but designing the appropriate scenario will be the most important component of the intervention in these cases. © 2018 Medical Ethics and History of Medicine Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

Scholars hold that migration can be considered as a switching of people's place of residence, but the migration of people is not limited to the migration of residence. The marketing field also borrows the population migration theory to further explore the switching behavior of customers; educationalists also discuss migration of learning through migration theory. In this regard, the migration of human beings is a process of historical evolution, though it takes several decades to understand history from the perspective of such evolution. Hence, if there is a decision-making system that simulates evolution and estimation through 3D graphics, then players may better understand the impact of environmental migration and changes on humanity. This study adopts Push-Pull-Mooring (PPM) theory to explain the migration of human beings. Push is generated from people's dissatisfaction with their place of residence, Pull is from attractions of the new environment, and personal mooring produces the intention of switching. A set of Gamification Environmental Education Applications (GEEA) and a migration scale for such apps are developed herein to explain the state where computer gamers switch to mobile app games. The results show that all four hypotheses are supported, and the path coefficient of each hypothesis is highly significant. The R2 values of five intrinsic constructs are Push (R2 = 0.321), Mooring (R2 = 0.574), Pull (R2 = 0.413), Switching intention (SI) (R2 = 0.552), and SB (R2 = 0.626), where the R2 value of SB is quite high, indicating that the relationship between the switching behavior (SB) and the four precursors exhibits great explanatory power. Hence, the explanatory power of this model is convincing, and the teaching materials designed through gamification education deliver better learning outcomes. © 2018 by the authors.";"Migration theory; Simulation games; Sustainability environment education; Technology acceptance model (TAM) model; Theory of planned behavior";"computer simulation; decision making; design; environmental education; learning; marketing; population migration; residential location; sustainability; teaching";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

This study investigates the extent to which game-based learning (GBL) and gamification could improve the sexual health education of adolescent students. We conducted a randomized control trial of GBL and gamification experimental conditions. We made a comparison with traditional teaching as a control condition in order to establish differences between the three teaching conditions. The sexual health education topics were delivered in a masked fashion, 40-min a week for five weeks. A mixed-method research approach was uses to assess and analyze the results for 120 students from a secondary school in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. Students were divided into groups of 40 for each of the three teaching methods: GBL, gamification, and the control group (the traditional teaching method). The average post-test scores for GBL (Mean = 79.94, SD = 11.169) and gamification (Mean = 79.23, SD = 9.186) were significantly higher than the control group Mean = 51.93, SD = 18.705 (F (2, 117) = 54.75, p = 0.001). Overall, statistically significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) were found for the constructs of Motivation, Attitude, Knowledge, and Engagement (MAKE). This study suggests that the two innovative teaching approaches can be used to improve the sexual health education of adolescent students. The methods can potentially contribute socially, particularly in improving sexual health behaviour and adolescents’ knowledge in regions plagued by years of sexual health problems, including HIV/AIDS. © 2018 by the authors.

Once play is positioned as a state of mind, activities that constitute work need not be disjunct from playful behavior. Yet for most workers, work is rarely if ever playful, and attempts to import play behavior into the workplace (‘gamification’) do not result in greater playfulness. Part of this problem results from specific aesthetic values for games having dominated both work and play. As Roger Caillois warned half a century ago, sport-like values have increasingly saturated the culture of the overdeveloped world. Meanwhile, gamification processes have only been able to export task-focussed reward structures from the domain of play–practices that descend from Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but that have been denuded of their playful qualities. In parallel to the gamification of work has been the gamification of games, namely an increasing emphasis on tasks to structure video game play (e.g., achievements), and thus make them more compelling yet less playful. In so much as this entails forcing particular patterns of understanding onto both players and workers, this makes gamification a parallel to Jacques Rancière's stultification in education: a binding of wills instead of an emancipation. If we want a world where work could be more playful, we must begin by breaking the cultural dominance of sport-like and task-like aesthetics of play, and endeavour to overcome the underlying fears that prevent work from being played. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.";"Caillois; cybervirtue; digital games; games; gamification; Huizinga; Play; Rancière; stultification";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

After the class, the learning attitude of learners was measured through surveys and in-depth interviews. As a result, first, it was found that the degree of preparation participation in flip learning using gaming elements had a statistically significant increase from 65.56% to 78.89%, compared with the traditional flip learning using YouTube. Second, comparing the academic achievements showed a diagnostic assessment of 57.44 before applying the gaming elements and 20.17 after the application. However, for summative assessment, the degree after applying gaming elements was statistically higher at 84.52 than the degree before application, which was 78.86. Third, comparing academic achievement with word game results showed no significant correlation, and it is judged that all students were able to enjoy word games, regardless of their grades. Also, when the average word game scores were compared based on students’ grades, mid-upper level students had statistically significant higher scores than upper level students. Lastly, analysis on the correlation between attitude and word game showed that there is a quantitatively high correlation between the ranking system's competitive spirit and interest.

Since these algorithms are complex, there is a need for a system which would enable their application both in everyday work and education processes. This paper describes a software system for learning AI algorithms called SAIL (Software System for AI Learning), which can be used both on computers and mobile devices. The paper gives examples of lab exercises and self-study tasks that through graphic representation and detailed procedures help students master this area. Students can enter their examples into the system and obtain correct solutions for those examples. At any point when an example is simulated, a student can proceed to the next step or go back to the previous one, save the current simulation as a file, or print the detailed procedure as a task solution. SAIL helps lecturers go through the syllabus more efficiently and improve class material, while at the same time it helps students get a better grasp of implemented algorithms. SAIL can also benefit software engineers, who can select and simulate an adequate algorithm to solve a specific problem.

Practical software development courses and projects are inherently motivating to students, as they provide necessary elements such as agency, relatedness, and the strong sense of competence upon completing software engineering tasks. In contrast, reading research articles and technical white papers feels dry and non-engaging. Nevertheless, a well-balanced MSc programme curriculum covers both, learning through construction and practical courses as well as research courses. The main motivation for the development of game-centric approaches to the research aspects of curriculum is to improve students’ interest and engagement with those courses.

In this field, some alternatives have been generated in these platforms to extend their functions beyond the courses proposed. MyMOOCSpace is a cloud-based tool that improves the interaction of students participating in a MOOC course. However, a variation of this tool allows for improved collaboration and preparation of assessments and/or tests for students in a traditional higher education class. This article presents a study using the MyMOOCSpace tool as an alternative to encourage collaboration and preparation of students to take traditional tests or assessments in the field of higher education. To evaluate this application and demonstrate the impact on the results of the evaluations, a case study is presented in which 40 computer engineering students from a Chilean university participated.

Previous studies have explored online education of health professionals in Second Life (SL), the most widely used virtual world, but none of the previous learning experiences were related to radiology. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential use of SL for undergraduate radiology education and the involvement of students in SL learning activities. Materials and Methods: We delivered a 4-week voluntary undergraduate radiology education program in SL, based on synchronous sessions and asynchronous tasks, with two modalities: introduction to basic radiology for first-cycle (first- to third-year) students and case-based clinical radiology for second-cycle (fourth- to sixth-year) students. Participants completed an evaluation questionnaire about the experiences after the learning program. Results: Forty-six students (20 first-cycle and 26 second-cycle) participated in this study. They found the contents of the course appropriate (mean ≥ 4.53/5), the initiative interesting, and the environment attractive (mean ≥ 4.32/5), and they were willing to participate in future SL experiences (mean ≥ 4.63/5). All students highly rated the organization, the content, the benefit to their medical education, and the professor (mean ≥ 9.05/10). Conclusion: Online radiology education using SL is feasible and well received by medical students of all year groups. The students participated and engaged in this activity very positively and rated the experience highly. The potential of using SL for radiology education includes promising expectations regarding collaborative learning and gamification. © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists";"e-Learning; Education; radiology; undergraduate medical education; virtual worlds";"collaborative learning; course content; course evaluation; experiential learning; exploratory research; feasibility study; futurology; health care organization; human; learning environment; medical education; medical school; medical student; Note; outcome of education; personal experience; priority journal; questionnaire; radiology; social participation; teacher; undergraduate student; virtual reality; curriculum; education; health personnel attitude; learning; medical education; procedures; radiology; Attitude of Health Personnel; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humans; Learning; Radiology; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Virtual Reality";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

However, there are not many approaches that tackle this in primary school learning environments. The most popular technologies in the classroom are still traditional video consoles and desktop computers, which complicate the design of collaborative activities since they are essentially mono-user. The recent popularization of handheld devices such as tablets and smartphones has made it possible to build affordable, scalable, and improvised collaborative gamified activities by creating a multi-tablet environment. In this paper we present Quizbot, a collaborative gamified quiz application to practice different subjects, which can be defined by educators beforehand. Two versions of the system are implemented: a tactile for tablets laid on a table, in which all the elements are digital; and a tangible in which the tablets are scattered on the floor and the components are both digital and physical objects. Both versions of Quizbot are evaluated and compared in a study with eighty primary-schooled children in terms of user experience and quality of collaboration supported. Results indicate that both versions of Quizbot are essentially equally fun and easy to use, and can effectively support collaboration, with the tangible version outperforming the other one with respect to make the children reach consensus after a discussion, split and parallelize work, and treat each other with more respect, but also presenting a poorer time management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd";"Children; Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL); Multi-display environments (MDE); Tablets; Tangible user interfaces (TUI)";"Personal computers; User interfaces; Children; Computer Supported Collaborative Learning; Multi display environments; Tablets; Tangible user interfaces; Computer aided instruction";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Gamification in software engineering (SE) education is in its infancy. However, as SE educators we are particularly interested in understanding how gamification is pollinating our field and the extent to which the above claim is valid in our context. A systematic literature mapping has underscored the difficulty in fully corroborating the above claim because few empirical data are available so far. However, key trends and challenges have been identified. We found that the purpose of applying gamification in the SE field is mostly directly related to improving student engagement and, to a lesser extent, to improving student knowledge, although other targets are the application of SE best practices and socialization. We have also discussed insightful issues regarding the implementation cost of gamification, patterns in the most often used gamification elements, and the SE processes and teaching activities addressed. Of the identified challenges, we should highlight the complexity of deciding which gamification approach to follow, the lack of information for choosing gamification elements and the need to control the impact of gamification. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.";"Education; Gamification; Software engineering; Systematic mapping";"Education; Mapping; Software engineering; Best practices; Enhanced learning; Gamification; Implementation cost; Student engagement; Student knowledge; Systematic mapping; Teaching activities; Students";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Green";"Scopus"

It is increasingly being used as an adjunct to traditional teaching strategies in medical education to engage the millennial learner and enhance adult learning. The extant literature has focused on determining whether the implementation of gamification results in better learning outcomes, leading to a dearth of research examining its theoretical underpinnings within the medical education context. The authors define gamification, explore how gamification works within the medical education context using self-determination theory as an explanatory mechanism for enhanced engagement and motivation, and discuss common roadblocks and challenges to implementing gamification. Although previous gamification research has largely focused on determining whether implementation of gamification in medical education leads to better learning outcomes, the authors recommend that future research should explore how and under what conditions gamification is likely to be effective. Selective, purposeful gamification that aligns with learning goals has the potential to increase learner motivation and engagement and, ultimately, learning. In line with self-determination theory, game design elements can be used to enhance learners' feelings of relatedness, autonomy, and competence to foster learners' intrinsic motivation. Poorly applied game design elements, however, may undermine these basic psychological needs by the overjustification effect or through negative effects of competition. Educators must, therefore, clearly understand the benefits and pitfalls of gamification in curricular design, take a thoughtful approach when integrating game design elements, and consider the types of learners and overarching learning objectives. © by the Association of American Medical Colleges.";"";"adult; article; competition; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; medical education; motivation; outcome assessment; theoretical study";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Interventions that promote healthy sleep, such as those that focus on the dissemination of behavioral and environmental recommendations of sleep hygiene with children, are presented as an alternative. Serious game design offers wide-reaching domains in health applications and is increasing in popularity, particularly with children and teens because of it's potential to engage and motivate players differently from other interventions. This study aims to evaluate effects of serious game on sleep hygiene recommendations ""Perfect Bedroom: learn to sleep well,"" on sleep habits and sleep parameters of healthy children. This is an experimental, prospective and quantitative study. We will randomize children in experimental (n = 88) and no intervention groups (n = 88). The experiment has four stages (pre-intervention, intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up), which will count with participation of children and their parents/guardians. In the evaluation stages, the guardians will answer questionnaires and scales to assess sociodemographic and health data, sleep habits and sleep pattern of their child. The children themselves will answer the following: a scale to assess sleepiness levels, a questionnaire to evaluate the serious game and the game itself, will characterize their bedroom and the activities they perform before sleep, with strategies developed by researches. Intervention with experimental group conducted with the serious game ""Perfect Bedroom"" will happen twice a week, for 3 weeks in a row, resulting in six sessions of 50 min each. Inferential analysis will be conducted for comparisons between groups and intragroups to measure effect of intervention in primary outcomes (sleep habits) and secondary outcomes (sleep parameters). We expect that the intervention with this game can provide valuable evidence to a new approach in promoting healthy sleep habits, with applications in clinical, educational, and familiar settings, which could diminish future health issues and risk at psychiatric diseases, decreasing the social burden of treatments for these conditions in children. © 2018 Almondes and Leonardo.";"Children; Gamification; Health education; Interactive learning; Serious game; Sleep; Sleep hygiene; Sleep quality";"";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

Of particular interest were the considerations of pre-service teachers concerning the age levels of a target audience that they believed would benefit from instruction with this particular educational tool. Following a mixed-research methodological pattern, the study was conducted in two consecutive stages. The first stage involved a quasi-experiment and the second was handled as a case study. In order to examine the long-term effects of Wiki activities supported by gamification elements on student academic success, a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical test was conducted based on scores from an initial pre-knowledge test, an applied interim examination, and a final examination. In order to determine the opinions of teacher candidates regarding Wiki activities and the process of gamification, results from an open-ended questionnaire were consulted. It was eventually discovered that students in both the Wiki-only (p = 0.02) and gamified-Wiki (p = 0.00) activity groups displayed significantly greater academic success compared to a control group. Although gamification elements also caused a significant difference between the two Wiki groups in terms of the number of times content is displayed (1670 > 637) and edited (38 > 18), it was observed that participation rates fell over time in both groups. As for academic success, there was no difference between the two Wiki groups (p = 0.92). It was found that teacher candidates regard Wiki and gamification activities positively. Also, it was noted that they did not possess an adequate level of consciousness of the fact that student capabilities are an important factor in making effective use of technology. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd";"Gamification; Integration of technology in education; Web 2.0; Wiki";"Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Gamification; Teaching; Educational activities; Level of consciousness; Methodological patterns; Open-ended questionnaire; Technology in educations; Undergraduate students; Web 2.0; Wiki; Students";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

The implementation of the gamified course lasted two academic terms. The subsequent evaluation from a cohort of 136 students indicated that student performance was significantly higher among those who participated in the gamified system than in those who engaged with the nongamified, traditional delivery, while behavioral engagement in online learning activities was positively related to course performance, after controlling for gender, attendance, and Year 1 PPD performance. Two interesting phenomena appeared when we examined the influence of student background: female students participated significantly more in online learning activities than male students, and students with jobs engaged significantly more in online learning activities than students without jobs. The gamified course design advocated in this work may have significant implications for educators who wish to develop engaging technology-mediated learning environments that enhance students’ learning, or for a broader base of professionals who wish to engage a population of potential users, such as managers engaging employees or marketers engaging customers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd";"Flipped classroom; Gamification; Higher education; Student engagement; Student-centered learning";"Computer aided instruction; Curricula; E-learning; Human resource management; Teaching; Flipped classrooms; Gamification; Higher education; Student engagement; Student-centered learning; Students";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Green";"Scopus"

Implementing technology-driven tools and best practices can be a challenge due to limited accessibility to clinically relevant resources, and reduced workforce engagement. To address this issue, an evidence-based practice change project was implemented in a community hospital located in New Jersey. The aims of this project were twofold: 1) increase nurses' knowledge with respect to best practices for catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI); and 2) enhance frontline staff engagement in best practices using a technologydriven platform infused with game-based learning. The project followed a multi-modal, time-series interventional design in which mobile tools were incorporated at the POC to provide targeted CAUTI education, and best practice strategies for registered nurses (n = 37) working in the intensive care and medical/surgical units. Presentations, videos, quizzes, case studies, and discussion boards were uploaded weekly onto a mobile technology platform (MTP) for eight weeks. This socio-technical frontline strategy allowed for just-in-time training (JIT) that promoted action-oriented learning. To incentivize ongoing user engagement, nurses accrued gamification reward points for completing structured online learning activities. Results demonstrated an 18.2% increase in sustained nursing knowledge retention scores (p = .02). In addition, staff rated technology uptake as very favorable at 87%-100%. Findings revealed the project increased nurses' knowledge of CAUTI best practices guidelines, promoted active staff engagement, encouraged technology use, and supported a positive change in POC practices overall. © 2018 Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS).";"";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

MS-related symptoms impact negatively on the quality of life of persons with MS, who need to be active in the management of their health. mHealth apps could support these patient groups by offering useful tools, providing reliable information, and monitoring symptoms. A previous study from this group identified needs, barriers, and facilitators for the use of mHealth solutions among persons with MS. It is unknown how commercially available health apps meet these needs. Objective: The main objective of this review was to assess how the features present in MS apps meet the reported needs of persons with MS. Methods: We followed a combination of scoping review methodology and systematic assessment of features and content of mHealth apps. A search strategy was defined for the two most popular app stores (Google Play and Apple App Store) to identify relevant apps. Reviewers independently conducted a screening process to filter apps according to the selection criteria. Interrater reliability was assessed through the Fleiss-Cohen coefficient (k=.885). Data from the included MS apps were extracted and explored according to classification criteria. Results: An initial total of 581 potentially relevant apps was found. After removing duplicates and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 30 unique apps were included in the study. A similar number of apps was found in both stores. The majority of the apps dealt with disease management and disease and treatment information. Most apps were developed by small and medium-sized enterprises, followed by pharmaceutical companies. Patient education and personal data management were among the most frequently included features in these apps. Energy management and remote monitoring were often not present in MS apps. Very few contained gamification elements. Conclusions: Currently available MS apps fail to meet the needs and demands of persons with MS. There is a need for health professionals, researchers, and industry partners to collaborate in the design of mHealth solutions for persons with MS to increase adoption and engagement. © Guido Giunti, Estefanía Guisado Fernández, Enrique Dorronzoro Zubiete, Octavio Rivera Romero.";"Apps; Chronic conditions; EHealth; Fatigue; Fatigue management; Gamification; MHealth; Multiple sclerosis; Physical activity; Usability; User-centered design";"";"English";"Review";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

Past research demonstrates that serious games are prime candidates to utilise these principles, however the potential benefits of this approach for delivering drug education are yet to be examined in Australia, a country where drug education in schools is mandatory. Design and Methods: The serious game ‘Pure Rush’ was developed across three stages. First, formative consultation was conducted with 115 students (67% male, aged 15–17 years), followed by feasibility and acceptability testing of a prototype of the game (n = 25, 68% male). In the final stage, 281 students (62% female, aged 13–16 years) were randomly allocated to receive a lesson involving Pure Rush or an active control lesson. The lessons were compared in terms of learning outcomes, lesson engagement and future intentions to use illicit drugs. Results: Students enjoyed playing Pure Rush, found the game age-appropriate and the information useful to them. Both the Pure Rush and the active control were associated with significant knowledge increase from pre to post-test. Among females, multi-level mixed-effects regression showed knowledge gain was greater in the Pure Rush condition compared to control (β = 2.36, 95% confidence interval 0.36–4.38). There was no evidence of between condition differences in lesson engagement or future intentions to use illicit drugs. Discussion and Conclusions: Pure Rush is an innovative online drug education game that is well received by students and feasible to implement in schools.

This study describes and evaluates the Engaging an Interdisciplinary Team for NSCLC (GAIN 3.0) experiential learning-based educational curriculum. Methods: GAIN 3.0 was designed to enhance interdisciplinary collaboration for effective NSCLC diagnosis, assessment, and treatment. The program used a flipped classroom model that included an e-learning component prior to a live 6-hour interactive program. The interactive program included hands-on simulations, small group workshops, gamification, and case discussions. Participants included academic and community members of multidisciplinary lung cancer teams. Assessments included an online baseline survey, a pretest and posttest, a program evaluation, a long-term survey (LTS), and on-site faculty evaluation of participants. Results: Of 416 attendees to 13 live GAIN 3.0 programs (nine in the United States and four in Europe), 304 (73%) completed the pretest and 187 (45%) completed the posttest. Out of a perfect score of 12 points, program participants had a mean test score of 6.3 ± 2.1 on the pretest (52%) and 7.8 ± 2.1 on the posttest (65%) (P =.03). There was an overall knowledge increase of 13% from pretest to posttest. Most LTS respondents (65%) rated the GAIN 3.0 live programs as “high impact.” On the LTS, the areas with the greatest gains in participants who had very high confidence were communication across disciplines, use of a team-based approach, and personalized treatment. Conclusions: GAIN 3.0 was a highly successful interdisciplinary activity that improved participants’ knowledge, competence, and likely the clinical care provided to patients with NSCLC. © 2017 American College of Chest Physicians";"education; flipped classroom; lung cancer; problem based learning; simulation";"Article; cancer diagnosis; clinical practice; community sample; controlled study; curriculum; education program; Europe; health survey; human; interdisciplinary education; interpersonal communication; knowledge; learning style; non small cell lung cancer; online system; paramedical disciplines; personalized medicine; pretest posttest design; priority journal; scoring system; simulation; United States; attitude to health; clinical competence; clinical trial; curriculum; education; health care personnel; lung tumor; medical education; multicenter study; non small cell lung cancer; patient care; problem based learning; procedures; pulmonology; randomized controlled trial; standards; teaching; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Clinical Competence; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Continuing; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Patient Care Team; Problem-Based Learning; Pulmonary Medicine";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Bronze";"Scopus"

However, many of these applications fail to achieve the desired benefits of gamification, mainly because of a poor design. Objective: This paper explores the conceptualization, implementation and monitoring phases of meaningful gamification strategies and proposes a solution for strategy experts that hides the implementation details and helps them focus only on what is crucial for the success of the strategy. The solution makes use of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology. Method: An easy-to-use graphical editor is used to provide the high-level models that represent the design of the gamification strategy and its deployment and monitoring. These models contain the event pattern definitions to be automatically transformed into code. This code is then deployed both in a CEP engine to detect the conditions expressed in such patterns and in an enterprise service bus to execute the corresponding pattern actions. Results: The paper reports on the use of both a graphical modeling editor for gamification domain definition and a graphical modeling editor for gamification strategy design, monitoring and code generation in event-based systems. It also shows how the proposal can be used to design and automate the implementation and monitoring of a gamification strategy in an educational domain supported by a well-known Learning Management System (LMS) such as Moodle. Conclusion: It can be concluded that this unprecedented model-driven approach leveraging gamification and CEP technology provides strategy experts with the ability to graphically define gamification strategies, which can be directly transformed into code executable by event-based systems. Therefore, this is a novel solution for bringing CEP closer to any strategy expert, positively influencing the gamification strategy design, implementation and real-time monitoring processes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.";"Complex event processing; Gamification; Graphical modelling editor; Model-Driven Engineering; Monitoring; Strategy design";"Codes (symbols); Education; Graphic methods; Software architecture; Complex event processing; Gamification; Graphical modelling; Model-driven Engineering; Strategy designs; Monitoring";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

However, recent technologies have provided new opportunities for using games and their elements to enhance learning and student engagement. Objective: The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we discuss how game-related methods have been used in the context of software engineering education by means of a systematic mapping study. Second, we investigate how these game-related methods support specific knowledge areas from software engineering. By achieving these goals, we aim not only to characterize the state of the art on the use of game-related methods on software engineering education, but also to identify gaps and opportunities for further research. Method: We carried out a systematic mapping study to identify primary studies which address the use, proposal or evaluation of games and their elements on software engineering education. We classified primary studies based on type of approaches, learning goals based on software engineering knowledge areas, and specific characteristics of each type of approach. Results: We identified 156 primary studies, published between 1974 and June 2016. Most primary studies describe the use of serious games (86) and game development (57) for software engineering education, while Gamification is the least explored method (10). Learning goals of these studies and their development of skills are mostly related to the knowledge areas of “Software Process”, “Software Design”, and “Professional Practices”. Conclusions: The use of games in software engineering education is not new. However, there are some knowledge areas where the use of games can still be further explored. Gamification is a new trend and existing research in the field is quite preliminary. We also noted a lack of standardization both in the definition of learning goals and in the classification of game-related methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.";"Game development based learning; Game-based learning; Gamification; Software engineering education";"Education; Engineering education; Mapping; Serious games; Software engineering; Engineering knowledge; Game development; Game-based Learning; Gamification; Professional practices; Specific knowledge; Student engagement; Systematic mapping studies; Software design";"English";"Review";"";"Scopus"

Performance on quiz questions related to each of the two games was compared between students who played each respective game and those who did not. The hypothesis was that students who played a game would perform better on related questions than those who did not play that game.

We have identified as an area of particular strength children's attitudes to gender equality, and we have determined that many children demonstrate competency to deal with consumer-related issues appropriately. However, at the other extreme, we have established that children demonstrate considerable uncertainty concerning the levels of force that adult authority figures are permitted to exercise over them. We have found in the course of this study that children are competent and willing to express their views on matters that concern them.

Whether an innovative interactive e-learning multimedia (IM) module or a conventional PowerPoint show (PPS) module using M-TEL to teach emergent otorhinolaryngology–head and neck surgery (ORL-HNS) disorders is feasible and efficient in undergraduate medical students is unknown. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the impact of a novel IM module with a conventional PPS module using M-TEL for emergent ORL-HNS disorders with regard to learning outcomes, satisfaction, and learning experience. Methods: This pilot study was conducted at an academic teaching hospital and included 24 undergraduate medical students who were novices in ORL-HNS. The cognitive style was determined using the Group Embedded Figures Test. The participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to one of the two groups matched by age, sex, and cognitive style: the IM group and the PPS group. During the 100-min learning period, the participants were unblinded to use the IM or PPS courseware on a 7-inch tablet. Pretests and posttests using multiple-choice questions to evaluate knowledge and multimedia situational tests to evaluate competence were administered. Participants evaluated their satisfaction and learning experience by the AttrakDiff2 questionnaire, and provided feedback about the modules. Results: Overall, the participants had significant gains in knowledge (median of percentage change 71, 95% CI 1-100, P<.001) and competence (median of percentage change 25, 95% CI 0-33, P=.007) after 100 min of learning. Although there was no significant difference in knowledge gain between the two groups (median of difference of percentage change 24, 95% CI −75 to 36; P=.55), competence gain was significantly lower in the IM group compared with the PPS group (median of difference of percentage change −41, 95% CI −67 to −20; P=.008). However, the IM group had significantly higher scores of satisfaction (difference 2, 95% CI 2-4; P=.01), pragmatic quality (difference 1.7, 95% CI 0.1-2.7; P=.03), and hedonic stimulation (difference 1.9, 95% CI 0.3-3.1; P=.01) compared with the PPS group. Qualitative feedback indicated that the various games in the IM module attracted the participants’ attention but that the nonlinearly arranged materials affected their learning. Conclusions: Using M-TEL for undergraduate medical education on emergent ORL-HNS disorders, an IM module seems to be useful for gaining knowledge, but competency may need to occur elsewhere. While the small sample size reduces the statistical power of our results, its design seems to be appropriate to determine the effects of M-TEL using a larger group.

Gamification is increasingly gaining attention among system designers across various industries especially in education due to the benefits associated with its implementation. The adoption of gamification in information systems (IS) education is promising for engaging and motivating students to complete their degree programs. Call for research in this area is particularly on the increase in the IS field. Accordingly, we need to organize the aggregation of research in this area and use common terminologies to promote progressive research practice in the field. In this paper, we use a multi-method approach to systematically review existing research on gamification in IS education to identify common terminologies, identify trends in topics studied, highlight understudied areas, and, thus, present opportunities for future research. The multi-method approach combines classical systematic review method and social network analysis to provide additional insight into the knowledge structure of researchers involved in the gamification of IS education. This review also highlights possible interventions that can improve student retention in IS education through the design of effective gamified courses. © 2018 by the Association for Information Systems.";"Engagement; Game dynamics; Game elements; Game mechanics; Gamification; Motivation";"Curricula; Motivation; Terminology; Engagement; Game elements; Gamification; Knowledge structures; Multi-method approach; Student retention; System designers; Systematic Review; Students";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Green";"Scopus"

Methods: Two first-year classes of dental undergraduate students were recruited for the study which extended over 4 months and ended in January 2015. A pre-intervention assessment of students’ academic writing skills was performed using criteria to evaluate writing. The same criteria were used to evaluate the final writing assignment after the intervention. Students’ satisfaction with game aspects was assessed. The per cent change in writing score was regressed on scores of satisfaction with game aspects controlling for gender. Perceived improvement in writing was also assessed. Results: Data from 87 (94.6%) students were available for analysis. Students’ overall satisfaction with the gamified experience was modest [mean (SD) = 5.9 (2.1)] and so was their overall perception of improvement in writing [mean (SD) = 6.0 (2.2)]. The per cent score of the first assignment was 35.6 which improved to 80 in the last assignment. Satisfaction with playing the game was significantly associated with higher percentage of improvement in actual writing skills [regression coefficient (95% confidence interval) = 21.1 (1.9, 40.2)]. Conclusion: Using gamification in an obligatory course for first-year dental students was associated with an improvement in academic writing skills although students’ satisfaction with game aspects was modest and their willingness to use gamification in future courses was minimal. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We describe a platform that integrates these tools to support young patients in diabetes self-management through educational game playing, monitoring and motivational feedback. We describe the design of the platform referring to principles from healthcare, persuasive system design and serious game design. The virtual coach is a game guide that can also provide personalized feedback about the user’s daily care related activities which have value for making progress in the game world. User evaluations with patients under pediatric supervision revealed that the use of mobile technology in combination with web-based elements is feasible but some assumptions made about how users would connect to the platform were not satisfied in reality, resulting in less than optimal user experiences.

Because simulation can provide substantial quantitative participant feedback, leaderboards can be used, not only locally but also in a multidepartment, multicenter fashion. Quick Response (QR) codes can be integrated to allow participants to access and upload data. We present the development, implementation, and initial evaluation of an online leaderboard employing principles of gamification using points, badges, and leaderboards designed to enhance competition among healthcare providers. Method This article details the fundamentals behind the development and implementation of a user-friendly, online, multinational leaderboard that employs principles of gamification to enhance competition and integrates a QR code system to promote both self-reporting of performance data and data integrity. An open-ended survey was administered to capture perceptions of leaderboard implementation. Results Conceptual step-by-step instructions detailing how to apply the QR code system to any leaderboard using simulated or real performance metrics are outlined using an illustrative example of a leaderboard that employed simulated cardiopulmonary resuscitation performance scores to compare participants across 17 hospitals in 4 countries for 16 months. The following three major descriptive categories that captured perceptions of leaderboard implementation emerged from initial evaluation data from 10 sites: (1) competition, (2) longevity, and (3) perceived deficits. Conclusions A well-designed leaderboard should be user-friendly and encompass best practices in gamification principles while collecting and storing data for research analyses. Easy storage and export of data allow for longitudinal record keeping that can be leveraged both to track compliance and to enable social competition.

Nurturing proper attitudes in students is one of the greatest challenges for educators. Health professionals must incorporate empathy into their practice. Creative teaching strategies may offer a feasible approach to enhancing empathy-related competence. The present article focuses on analyzing current, empathy-related curriculums in nursing education in Taiwan, exploring the concepts of empathy and game-based learning, presenting the development of an empathy board game as a teaching aid, and, finally, evaluating the developed education application. Based on the learner-centered principle, this aid was designed with peer learning, allowing learners to influence the learning process, to simulate the various roles of clients, and to develop diverse interpersonal dialogues. The continuous learning loops were formed using the gamification mechanism and transformation, enabling students to connect and practice the three elements of empathy ability: emotion, cognition and expression. Via the game elements of competition, interaction, storytelling, real-time responses, concretizing feedback, integrated peer learning, and equality between teachers and students, students who play patient roles are able to perceive different levels of comfort, which encourages the development of insight into the meaning of empathy. Thereby, the goals of the empathy lesson is achievable within a creative game-based learning environment.";"Board game; Empathy; Gamed based learning; Nursing education";"adult; article; comfort; competition; curriculum; empathy; human; learning environment; nursing education; storytelling; student; Taiwan; teacher; teaching; game; learning; Education, Nursing; Empathy; Games, Experimental; Humans; Learning";"Chinese";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Here we evaluate PeerWise, a widely used and free online resource that allows students to author, answer and discuss multiple-choice questions. Study design We introduced two undergraduate medical student cohorts to PeerWise (n=603). We looked at their patterns of PeerWise usage; identified associations between student engagement and summative exam performance; and used focus groups to assess student perceptions of the value of PeerWise for learning. We undertook item analysis to assess question difficulty and quality. Results Over two academic years, the two cohorts wrote 4671 questions, answered questions 606 658 times and posted 7735 comments. Question writing frequency correlated most strongly with summative performance (Spearman's rank: 0.24, p=<0.001). Student focus groups found that: (1) students valued curriculum specificity; and (2) students were concerned about student-authored question quality. Only two questions of the 300 'most-answered' questions analysed had an unacceptable discriminatory value (point-biserial correlation <0.2). Conclusions Item analysis suggested acceptable question quality despite student concerns.

This article intends to present the concept of Gamification as a multimodal alternative for education, considering it a relatively recent initiative. It is a phenomenon still in its infancy, lacking in more studies and discussions, but not less interesting, since it proposes a new approach to education and many other segments of contemporary human knowledge. Method. The research shows that in Higher Education, as in other areas, its use is still incipient, because the controversy surrounding the theme is still considerable, however, it joins efforts with other proposals of the same magnitude, in an attempt to sublimate some of the learning problems of the individuals, leading them to the engagement and motivation in the educational environment. It is not a revolution, or a proposal to abandon pre-existing concepts and procedures, but an attempt to compose with what already exists and to take advantage of the benefits of evolution through which humanity passes, so that learning becomes increasingly more natural in the eyes of individuals. Results. Challenges will have to be transposed, and may be of a technological, financial, procedural, educational or structural nature.

This study explores promoting motivation in a distance education, third-year computer programming course via a gamified approach to improve coursework participation and student experience. Motivation was examined from a Self-Determination Theory (SDT) perspective, as gamified approaches often rely on external motivation and the explicit use of competition to engender internal motivation leading to desired behaviours. The results of using gamification in education are mixed, and its use is controversial. Two cycles of action research on the introduction of eight playful elements are reported on, and data relating to student engagement with the course and a student questionnaire was gathered. There was little evidence that the intervention led to behaviour change or improved scores; however, students responded very positively to the intervention, although some negative themes emerged. The extent to which the playful approach supported the basic psychological needs of SDT is discussed and the intervention's results critically considered, including whether the effort involved in such an approach was worth it. It was concluded that such playful approaches might have positive motivational effects. © 2018 Athabasca University.";"Distance learning; Gamification; Guided didactic conversation; Motivation; Self-determination theory";"";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

This increase in the popularity of digital games is mostly associated not only with the interesting designs of the digital games but also with the emotional satisfaction with these games. In recent years, this tendency towards digital games has led to the transfer of certain features of games to non-game contexts. The concept named gamification refers to the adaptation of game features to non-game contexts. Gamification has been in use in many areas in recent years. One of these areas is the field of education. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the effectiveness of elements of gamification in blended learning environments within the context of emotion, interest and online participation. In the study, the convergent parallel mixed design, which allowed explaining the quantitative and qualitative data in association with each other, was used. In this respect, the study was carried out with 63 university students (30 students in the experimental group and 33 students in the control group) in a period of 13 weeks. In the research process, the two groups of students were provided with the opportunity to experience the blended learning environment both on face-to-face basis and on online basis. The experimental group differed from the control group in terms of such gamification elements presented in face-to-face and online environments as being given directives, progress bar, badge, level, experience point, leaderboard, award, completion rate, activity completion, activity restriction and activity feedback.

In order to motivate the communities, in this case the students, to leverage IT tools and platforms to improve their learning experiences, utilizing gamification and mobile technologies are seen to be the suitable combinations. Gamification as a concept to enhance user participation is also gaining a lot of tractions in recent years, including in the higher education sector. Many researches have shown that gamification is effective to improve motivations in core learning activities, to push students to be more proactive in gaining knowledge. This research is conducted to integrate a new mobile application to the existing smart campus platform in Universitas Multimedia Nusantara, Indonesia, while also gamify several student routines and activities to enhance the campus experience. The system is built as a hybrid mobile application and evaluated for its user acceptance by analyzing its users' perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use which are derived from the technology acceptance model (TAM). Based on the feedbacks gathered from the users, the gamified system is perceived to be easy to use and useful to increase student's participation and to motivate the users to actively complete their campus routines. © 2018 Authors.";"Gamification; Marczewski gamification framework; Smart campus; Technology acceptance model; Universitas Multimedia Nusantara";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

In general, this approach is a combination of education and entertainment, also known as “edutainment” or “gamification” (Reinhardt 2007), a term used in the education sector when describing where motivation to learn is encouraged through adding a competitive element. It is thus a step away from simple consumption of information towards experiencing information and a more literal interpretation of “living history”.

The purpose of this paper is to introduce gaming science as a lens to magnify HSS integration opportunities in the scope of medical education and practice. Evidence supports gaming science innovations as effective teaching and learning tools to promote learner engagement in scientific and systems thinking for decision making in complex scenarios. Valuable insights and lessons gained through the history of war games have resulted in strategic thinking to minimize risk and save lives. In health care, where decisions can affect patient and population outcomes, gaming science innovations have the potential to provide safe learning environments to practice crucial decision-making skills. Research of gaming science limitations, gaps, and strategies to maximize innovations to further advance HSS in medical education and practice is required.

Instead, they come from almost anywhere and anyone. By opening up the ideation phase in the digital era, companies actually open their doors to external experts and solution-providers, searching for new partners and new technologies to incorporate into their existing products and services. Having this in mind, the goal of this study is to propose an integrated approach to collaboration in the phase of ideation, which would be in line with the concept of open innovation and supported by an appropriate business model. Accordingly, this paper enables understanding of how game-based ideation fits into innovation models; how games are incorporated into ideation processes; how games affect creativity and the nurture of ideas; how to develop a sustainable business model for this concept; and how to implement it in a real-life business environment. © 2018 TEMPUS Publications.";"Business model; Gamification; Ideation; Innovation community; Online platforms for open innovation";"Education; Engineering education; Business modeling; Gamification; Ideation; Innovation communities; Open innovation; Sustainable development";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

A motivational model emerges from several research studies providing teachers with an opportunity to view the use of extrinsic rewards in the context of learners to build intrinsic motivation. Special education is a distinctive education provision for students with disabilities and disorders. It encourages academic progress and personal and social development. It aims to enhance the behavior of the students through giving reinforcements and many different teaching methods and strategies. An increasingly part of the daily activities of students of all ages is computer games. It can be challenging to implement in the classroom because there were researches that have been shown that it can support student motivation and learning. In this study, the researchers examine the principles of engagement from games designed for entertainment, apply these principles to the design of learning activities and present a model of learning engagement. Incorporating gamification elements into exceptional learners’ environments can motivate and support student achievement.

In pursuit of energy efficiency and true sustainability, buildings must acquire the ability to interact as well as to generate synergies. The most prominent features of this approach are energy management and information flows which, intelligently designed, not only enhance buildings' capabilities, but also introduce a significant change in their relationship with the surrounds ('smart cities') and its inhabitants. This new paradigm calls for revisiting undergraduate architectural instruction, adopting a more complex overview of energy use and management in the design process, regarding buildings as dynamic rather than static entities. The methodology focuses on creating learning environments that favour students' participation in problem solving and assessment, encouraging teamwork based on case studies and stressing the connection between this new architecture, ICTs included, and social networks as participatory design tools.

It involves a large group of people solving a problem or completing a task for an individual or, more commonly, for an organisation. While the field of crowdsourcing has developed more quickly in information technology, it has great promise in health applications. This review examines uses of crowdsourcing in global health and health, broadly. Methods Semantic searches were run in Google Scholar for ""crowdsourcing,"" ""crowdsourcing and health,"" and similar terms. 996 articles were retrieved and all abstracts were scanned. 285 articles related to health. This review provides a narrative overview of the articles identified. Results Eight areas where crowdsourcing has been used in health were identified: diagnosis; surveillance; nutrition; public health and environment; education; genetics; psychology; and, general medicine/other. Many studies reported crowdsourcing being used in a diagnostic or surveillance capacity. Crowdsourcing has been widely used across medical disciplines; however, it is important for future work using crowdsourcing to consider the appropriateness of the crowd being used to ensure the crowd is capable and has the adequate knowledge for the task at hand. Gamification of tasks seems to improve accuracy; other innovative methods of analysis including introducing thresholds and measures of trustworthiness should be considered. Conclusion Crowdsourcing is a new field that has been widely used and is innovative and adaptable. With the exception of surveillance applications that are used in emergency and disaster situations, most uses of crowdsourcing have only been used as pilots. These exceptions demonstrate that it is possible to take crowdsourcing applications to scale. Crowdsourcing has the potential to provide more accessible health care to more communities and individuals rapidly and to lower costs of care. © 2018 Journal of Global Health.";"";"adult; article; crowdsourcing; diagnosis; disaster; education; emergency; female; general practice; genetics; global health; human; human experiment; male; narrative; nutrition; psychology; public health; systematic review; clinical trial (topic); global health; health; Clinical Trials as Topic; Crowdsourcing; Global Health; Health; Humans";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Gold, Green";"Scopus"

Analysis shows that children turn out to be unique ""experts"" of the world of childhood who, through a specially constructed conversation, can tell about their activity in the kindergarten and about their ideas for changing educational practices. Children emphasize importance of free playing with peers during the day, the specificity of care practices (eating and sleeping), the interaction tactics between the teacher and children, make their suggestions for creating more comfortable conditions in the kindergarten. Children turn out to be very creative innovators of practices to reconstruct the space of a kindergarten and to change the teacher's role and rules of communication.

Since the efficacy of this approach depends critically on the reward the trainer provides, we consider how the interaction between the trainer and the agent should be designed so as to increase the efficiency of the training process. This article investigates the influence of the agent’s socio-competitive feedback on the human trainer’s training behavior and the agent’s learning. The results of our user study with 85 participants suggest that the agent’s passive socio-competitive feedback—showing performance and score of agents trained by trainers in a leaderboard—substantially increases the engagement of the participants in the game task and improves the agents’ performance, even though the participants do not directly play the game but instead train the agent to do so. Moreover, making this feedback active—sending the trainer her agent’s performance relative to others—further induces more participants to train agents longer and improves the agent’s learning. Our further analysis shows that agents trained by trainers affected by both the passive and active social feedback could obtain a higher performance under a score mechanism that could be optimized from the trainer’s perspective and the agent’s additional active social feedback can keep participants to further train agents to learn policies that can obtain a higher performance under such a score mechanism. © 2017, The Author(s).";"Gamification; Human agent interaction; Learning from human reward; Reinforcement learning";"Education; Reinforcement learning; Vehicle performance; Competitive feedback; Gamification; Human agent interactions; Learning from human reward; Non-technical users; Social feedbacks; Social interactions; Training process; Autonomous agents";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green";"Scopus"

In this sense, we attained to conduct a hypothetical study to investigate whether gender stereotype threat in online gamified educational scenarios influences anxiety and performance. We conducted a three-stage survey where participants were asked indirectly about their anxiety, then they were redirected to a hypothetical online gamified system to solve a logic quiz. Afterward, their anxiety was assessed one more time in order to find out how much it had changed. We found evidence indicating the male-stereotyped environment affected participants’ anxiety. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd";"Anxiety; Gamification in education; Gender studies; Stereotype threat";"Distance education; E-learning; Social sciences; Students; Surveys; Anxiety; Educational environment; Gamification; Gender stereotypes; Gender studies; Motivation and engagements; On-line education; Stereotype threat; Education";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Among other techniques that are often applied by instructors to counteract this issue, those related to the use of gaming elements seem to very promising. In this context, considering the use of game-like properties in learning scenarios, known as gamification, has received increasing interest by academia in recent years. However, its application in higher education can be challenging, due to some unwanted effects caused by the lack of proven design methodologies have been detected. Choosing the adequate formal process for gamification design has become an important success requirement. This work presents a systematic review of the gamification design frameworks discussed in the literature, providing a useful resource to educational practitioners as well as gamification designers and researchers.

Associations between engagement and participant (n = 51) demographic and team characteristics (sex, age, education and team size) were examined, as well as temporal trends in engagement during the 50-day intervention. Analyses revealed significant associations between both engagement (p = <0.001) and gamification (p = 0.04) with education, with participants in the middle education category appearing to have the highest rates of engagement and use of gamification features. Gender was also related to engagement, with males demonstrating the highest use of the intervention’s gamification features (p = 0.004). Although compliance was consistently high for the duration, engagement declined steadily throughout the intervention. Engagement peaked on Wednesdays, coinciding with the delivery of a customised email reminder. Findings reveal individual differences in engagement with Active Team, highlighting a need to tailor interventions to the target audience.

The theory of gamified learning (Landers, 2014) posits that gamified approaches positively impact students’ attitudes, and in turn this change in attitudes impacts learning; however, research is needed to examine the role of attitude change in gamified approaches (Seaborn & Fels, 2014). A strong negative relationship between students’ attitudes towards statistics and their performance in statistics has been well documented. The need to help students have positive attitudes towards statistics, and therefore be more likely to achieve in the course, makes using gamified learning, which targets attitudes, an ideal domain to test the effects of gamification on attitudes. Methods. The aim in this quasi-experimental study was to examine the ability of gamified modules in a statistics course to have positive impacts on learning and attitudes towards statistics. Students in the experimental group were compared to previous cohorts completing the same course, but without the gamified exercises as well as published results from a large cohort of comparable students. Results. The attitudes of cognitive competence, affect, value and perceived difficulty were all positively impacted after completing the gamified exercises. The experimental group also had large effects of test performance one semester after completing the course. Conclusion. In line with the theory of gamified learning, these findings suggested that the gamified modules were successful in shifting students’ attitudes in a positive direction and subsequently increasing performance. Future studies should introduce randomization between students and examine the specific pathways between attitudes and performance. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.";"attitudes towards statistics; gamification; improving classroom teaching; pedagogical issues; post-secondary education; statistics education; teaching/learning strategies";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Following this pedagogical trend, the present study aimed to enhance the face-to-face instruction in flipped classrooms with the use of clickers. A game-like clicker application was implemented through a bring your own device (BYOD) model to gamify classroom dynamics in the spirit of question-and-answer competitions. A series of flipped learning lessons were created for the study, with clickers integrated into question-and-answer activities associated with each of the lessons as formative assessments to assist students in the learning of English as a foreign language. In this quasi-experimental research, the data were gathered using a summative assessment, a perception survey, and individual interviews. The collected data were then analyzed to compare the students’ flipped learning experiences, with or without clicker use. The results indicated that the gamified use of clickers had positive influences on student learning, with regard to their performance, perceptions, and preferences. This study thus suggests that the emerging generation of clicker technology allows for a cost-effective BYOD integration model in flipped classrooms, through which it is possible to seamlessly bridge pre-class and in-class activities and to effectively promote student learning. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.";"Bring your own device; clickers; English language teaching; flipped classrooms; gamification";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Popular location-based AR games often include elements that are known to predict place attachment: exploration, social relations or the experience of enjoyment in a place. We argue that positive emotions triggered by playing can influence players’ place attachment via the process of gamification. We tested this hypothesis in a correlational study conducted among Pokémon Go players. Our analyses showed that satisfaction from playing and the social relations made during play positively predict place attachment, but the amount of time spent on playing does not. A series of mediation analyses showed that relations among game satisfaction, social relations, and place attachment were mediated by the appraisal of the place as exciting.

Design In July 2016, we instituted a gamified microblogging project using Twitter as the platform and modified questions from one of several available question banks. A question of the day was posted at 7-o׳clock each morning, Monday through Friday. Respondents were awarded points for speed, accuracy, and contribution to discussion topics. The moderator challenged respondents by asking additional questions and prompted them to find evidence for their claims to fuel further discussion. Since 4 months into the microblogging program, a survey was administered to all residents. Responses were collected and analyzed. After 6 months of tweeting, residents took the ABSITE examination. We compared participating residents׳ ABSITE percentile rank to those of their nonparticipating peers. We also compared residents׳ percentile rank from 2016 to those in 2017 after their participation in the microblogging project. Setting The University of Connecticut general surgery residency is an integrated program that is decentralized across 5 hospitals in the central Connecticut region, including Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center, located in Hartford. Participants We advertised our account to the University of Connecticut general surgery residents. Out of 45 residents, 11 participated in Twitter microblogging (24.4%) and 17 responded to the questionnaire (37.8%). Results In all, 100% of the residents who were participating in Twitter reported that daily microblogging prompted them to engage in academic reading.

Implicit skills such as abnormality detection require repeated practice on clinical service and have few digital substitutes. Using mechanics traditionally deployed in video games such as clearly defined goals, rapid-fire levels, and narrow time constraints may be an effective way to teach implicit skills. Materials and Methods We created a freely available, online module to evaluate the ability of individuals to differentiate between normal and abnormal chest radiographs by implementing mechanics, including instantaneous feedback, rapid-fire cases, and 15-second timers. Volunteer subjects completed the modules and were separated based on formal experience with chest radiography. Performance between training and testing sets were measured for each group, and a survey was administered after each session. Results The module contained 74 cases and took approximately 20 minutes to complete. Thirty-two cases were normal radiographs and 56 cases were abnormal. Of the 60 volunteers recruited, 25 were “never trained” and 35 were “previously trained.” “Never trained” users scored 21.9 out of 37 during training and 24.0 out of 37 during testing (59.1% vs 64.9%, P value <.001). “Previously trained” users scored 28.0 out of 37 during training and 28.3 out of 37 during testing phases (75.6% vs 76.4%, P value =.56). Survey results showed that 87% of all subjects agreed the module is an efficient way of learning, and 83% agreed the rapid-fire module is valuable for medical students. Conclusions A gamified online module may improve the abnormality detection rates of novice interpreters of chest radiography, although experienced interpreters are less likely to derive similar benefits.

The main barriers that prevent teachers from using gamification were also analysed. Four main drivers (attention-motivation, entertainment, interactivity, and easiness to learn) and four main barriers (lack of resources, students’ apathy, subject fit, and classroom dynamics) were identified.

Using our previous experience, we developed a workshop that reviews musculoskeletal lumbar spine and hip conditions. This workshop also uses deductive and inductive modes of clinical reasoning and provides opportunities for learners to practice toggling from one to another while reviewing. Methods: Using exemplar musculoskeletal vignettes, this workshop allows residents to practice engaging and toggling between both modes of information processing. This workshop also includes pre- and posttests, small-group learning, and a small-group competition. Results: The workshop was implemented with a group of 26 physical medicine and rehabilitation residents. Although residents did well on the pretest, the workshop improved their test performance. Residents liked the workshop and thought it improved their diagnostic ability. Discussion: A workshop that included team- and case-based learning, key features assessment, script theory, and gamification was effective in engaging residents and resulted in high resident satisfaction and the perception of increased ability to tackle clinical problems. Learning from our experience with the previous workshop resulted in significant reduction in faculty time required, and increased the number of residents who were able to complete both pre- and posttests.";"Clinical Reasoning; Dual Processing Theory; Musculoskeletal";"clinical competence; education; hip; human; lumbosacral region; musculoskeletal disease; pathophysiology; physical examination; procedures; questionnaire; thinking; Clinical Competence; Education; Educational Measurement; Hip; Humans; Lumbosacral Region; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Physical Examination; Surveys and Questionnaires; Thinking";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Green";"Scopus"

To retain the player’s engagement, the design of the game mechanics must carefully balance so that learners can compete in each other and everyone has the chance to win. We present this study to determine the best gamification mechanics that will use in the mobile learning environment. Analysis Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to determine top six gamification elements for three types of gamification instruction interaction dimension. This method breaks the decision making problem into a hierarchy. Then, a pair wise comparisons matrix will develop to establish the priorities among the elements in the hierarchy.

Digital games are rapidly becoming an important tool for improving health behaviors and supporting the delivery of care and education. The purpose of this review is to provide a historical context for the use of gamification and videogames (including those using virtual reality) used in technology-based HIV interventions and to review new research in the field. Recent findings: A review of recently published (1 January 2016-31 March 2017) or presented abstracts (2016) identified a paucity of technology-based interventions that included gamification elements or any terms associated with videogames or gameplay. A larger portfolio of digital gaming interventions is in the pipeline. Summary: Use of digital games that include elements of gamification or consist of standalone videogames or virtual-reality-based games, represent a promising intervention strategy to address the HIV prevention and care continuum, especially among youth. Our review demonstrates that there is significant room for growth in this area in designing, developing, testing and most importantly, implementation and dissemination these novel interventions.

The burning question for South Africa is whether gamification can enhance a module or course on the level of higher education so much that an educational institution cannot do without it anymore, knowing that we are working with students belonging to the ‘Digital Wisdom generation’.

Gamification offers a great potential to promote and support the learning process by providing attractive, motivating and effective learning tools in order to achieve specific educational goals. So far studies have been conducted in various fields including sciences, mathematics, business and language, to examine the effectiveness of gamification in improving students’ performance. Nevertheless, little attention has been given in accounting education to the potential of gamification to enhance students’ performance when it is employed in the classroom. Learning accounting can be very tough and challenging for students especially when the subject is taught in a conventional way. To help students in understanding the underlying concepts of accounting and remembering the format of financial statements, the authors have proposed an accounting game, called “Accounting on the Block” (AOTB). This paper is aimed at demonstrating the effect of gamification approach of accounting teaching and learning on students’ performance as opposed to conventional approach. AOTB games were experimented in two accounting courses, Financial Accounting 2 (FAR160) and Financial and Management Accounting (ACC466) offered at one of the Higher Learning Institutions in Pahang during two academic sessions. The participants consisted of 32 students from FAR160 course and 54 students from ACC466 course. For each course, students were split into two groups: One group was taught with conventional lectures (control group) and the other group was taught using AOTB games (experimental group). The pre- and post-tests were conducted and recorded for both groups. The results of this study show that students who were exposed to the gamification performed better than the students who were taught via a conventional method. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

Most research in this field has been conducted in more economically advanced and developed regions, and there is a paucity of research in emerging country contexts. It is argued that gamification can be effectively utilised in these contexts to address learner engagement and motivation. The study investigated the extent to which six determined predictors (perceptions about playfulness, curriculum fit, learning opportunities, challenge, self-efficacy and computer anxiety) influence the advocacy to accept a gamified application by South African tourism teachers. Tourism education was selected for empirical study because of its popularity in developing countries and where the economy heavily depends on the sector. However, it is a highly under researched area. Data was obtained from 209 tourism teachers, and was tested against the research model using a structural equation modelling approach. Findings reveal that the constructs of perceived playfulness, curriculum fit have a positive, direct impact on the construct of behavioural intention. The exogenous constructs of challenge, learning opportunities, self-efficacy and computer anxiety have an indirect effect on behavioural intention via perceived playfulness or curriculum fit. The study may prove useful to educators and practitioners in understanding which determinants may influence the introduction of gamification into formal secondary education. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd";"Gamification; Secondary education; South Africa; Structural equation model; Technology acceptance";"Behavioral research; Curricula; Developing countries; E-learning; Teaching; Behavioural intentions; Gamification; Learning opportunity; Perceived playfulness; South Africa; Structural equation modeling; Structural equation modelling; Technology acceptance; Education";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Gamification is growing in popularity in education and workplace training, but it is unclear which game elements are conducive to learning. The theory of gamified learning suggests that one type of gamification, the addition of game fiction/narrative, can be used to improve learning outcomes, and the Technology-Enhanced Training Effectiveness Model (TETEM) suggests individual differences impact the strength of this effect. From this theoretical basis, this study gamified a training module with game fiction in order to improve outcomes over the original training. Results and Conclusion. In a study of 273 learners, trainees were significantly more satisfied with training enhanced with game fiction over the control text (d = 0.65) but did not differ in declarative knowledge scores by condition. Further, trainees in the control condition scored higher on procedural knowledge than trainees in the game fiction condition, although the effect was smaller (d = −0.40). Thus, the use of narrative improved reactions to training but at some cost to training effectiveness. Attitudes toward game-based learning were also tested as a moderator of the condition-outcome relationship. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.";"attitudes; game elements; game fiction; game-based learning; gamification; gamified learning; learning; narrative; psychology; training";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

To provide an overview of serious games and gamification to engage individuals in pro-environmental behaviours for energy efficiency, a computer-based search for relevant publications was performed in several databases. After applying the inclusion criteria and removing duplicates, 10 papers were included in this systematic review. Results showed that serious games and gamification have been used in three different areas related to energy efficiency: environmental education, consumption awareness, and pro-environmental behaviours. This review also showed that applied gaming interventions can be used in more than one of these three areas (comprehensive interventions). The main observation to be drawn from this review is that both serious games and gamification can foster energy-saving behaviours and vary widely in terms of type of games and of features that might be appealing and motivating. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd";"Applied gaming; Energy efficiency; Energy-saving; Gamification; Serious games";"";"English";"Review";"";"Scopus"

Netland (2013), based on a study of production systems in 30 firms, considered that all production systems share the same principles and that these are similar to the Lean system's principles. From its beginnings, the Lean system has evolved and spread to all sectors, and, although it is not the objective of this contribution to explain the scope of Lean, we can confirm that the literature still has no agreed definition of Lean production and, in some way, the general purpose formulations of the concept diverge. However, it is clear that the roots of Lean production should be acquired by future engineers for them to become Lean Thinkers. Understanding and assimilating these concepts on the theoretical level can be complex and so adequate tools need to be employed. We aimed to do this through gamification with LEGO.&copy; Set.Gamification has evolved from activity based learning and is an innovative learning system designed to improve knowledge through experience. It is the process of adding games or game-like elements to something (such as a task) to encourage participation. The Lean Management concepts we worked with were (1) Production based on takt time, (2) Process synchronization, (3) Small lot production, (4) Waste elimination, (5) Setup time reduction, (6) Lead time reduction (7) Cross training, (8) Employee involvement, (9) 5S, (10) Standardized work, (11) Visual control and Management and (12) Supplier involvement. The experience consisted of building a small LEGO ©structure and designing a balanced production line. The main aim was for students to acquire knowledge from the experience by highlighting ways to improve the production system and avoid waste through better planning and by applying some Lean practices. The experience was a complete success in terms of student involvement, and enjoyed satisfactory results in terms of Lean concept acquisition. In Conclusions, we categorize which Lean concepts were more easily consolidated through the game and propose improvements for subsequent experiences. Although the students acquired high levels of the abovementioned concepts, there were four concepts that did not meet the learning objective: Production based on takt time, Small lot production, Setup time reduction and Cross training. The problem was students did not have a standard framework within which to solve the case and, while proposing the concept of creating an innovative production system was solid, the lack of a standard framework made it difficult to compare the different solutions presented by the students. We hope this teaching experience will encourage Production and Operation management lecturers to adapt their lessons to this fascinating new way of teaching management concepts.";"Education; Gamification; Lean; LEGO©; Production systems";"";"Spanish";"Article";"";"Scopus"

In the organizational context, the Technology-Enhanced Training Effectiveness Model [TETEM] provides a framework to understand how technologies, like gamification, can effect change in various instructional outcomes. Specifically, application of TETEM suggests that gamification may not effect change in instructional outcomes when learner attitudes towards game-based learning and experience with video games are low. Method In this study, we test this model in the gamification context by assigning potential learners to read scenarios describing gamified instruction or traditional, PowerPoint instruction in a random order and assessing their training valence. Results On average, participants anticipated greater value from gamified instruction, but as predicted by TETEM, this effect was moderated by both video game experience and attitudes towards game-based learning. Among potential learners with high experience and attitudes, gamification produces better outcomes than PowerPoint, but among potential learners with low experience and attitudes, gamification produces worse outcomes than PowerPoint. Implications We provide empirical support for TETEM and conclude that for gamification to be successful, the attitudes and experience of participants must be assessed and ensured before gamification is implemented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd";"Experiment; Gamification; Learning; Reactions; TETEM; Training";"Experiments; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Learning systems; Personnel training; Educational context; Enhanced training; Game-based Learning; Gamification; Learning; Organizational context; Reactions; TETEM; Education computing";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

In the context of virtual education, a question that remains to be solved is associated with the level of motivation possessed by the students during the course. Usually, at the School of Engineering in the University of Medellín, this issue is tackled through activities such as chats and forums. Mostly, these activities are not enough to motivate the student in the activities related with the learning process. This work proposes two motivation strategies based on gamification and constructivism. These strategies are validated in a course called programming fundamentals, taught to all bachelor degrees given in the School of Engineering. Results obtained through the experiments suggest that proposed strategies improve the students performance and satisfaction in the course. Therefore, when teaching at the virtual scenario, using Information and Communication Technologies in the educational environment is not only the way to contact the student, it is the mean to develop pedagogical-didactic approaches that finally enrich the educational process and consequently motivate the student to perform well. © 2003-2012 IEEE.";"computer science; gamification; virtual courses";"Computer science; Education; Education computing; Motivation; Students; Teaching; Educational environment; Educational process; Gamification; Information and Communication Technologies; Programming fundamentals; School of engineering; Virtual course; Virtual education; E-learning";"Spanish";"Article";"";"Scopus"

The objectives of this study were to assess 1) farmers' motivations to participate as citizen scientists and 2) farmers' mobile telephone usage. Building on motivational factors identified from previous citizen science studies, a questionnaire based methodology was developed which allowed the analysis of motivational factors and their relation to farmers' characteristics. The questionnaire was applied in three communities of farmers, in countries from different continents, participating as citizen scientists. We used statistical tests to compare motivational factors within and among the three countries. In addition, the relations between motivational factors and farmers characteristics were assessed. Lastly, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to group farmers based on their motivations. Although there was an overlap between the types of motivations, for Indian farmers a collectivistic type of motivation (i.e., contribute to scientific research) was more important than egoistic and altruistic motivations. For Ethiopian and Honduran farmers an egoistic intrinsic type of motivation (i.e., interest in sharing information) was most important. While fun has appeared to be an important egoistic intrinsic factor to participate in other citizen science projects, the smallholder farmers involved in this research valued 'passing free time' the lowest. Two major groups of farmers were distinguished: one motivated by sharing information (egoistic intrinsic), helping (altruism) and contribute to scientific research (collectivistic) and one motivated by egoistic extrinsic factors (expectation, expert interaction and community interaction). Country and education level were the two most important farmers' characteristics that explain around 20% of the variation in farmers motivations. For educated farmers, contributing to scientific research was a more important motivation to participate as citizen scientists compared to less educated farmers. We conclude that motivations to participate in citizen science are different for smallholders in agriculture compared to other sectors.

Better patient education has been proposed to improve pain management of patients. Serious games have not been previously developed to help patients to learn how to manage their postoperative pain. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the development of a computer-based game for surgical patients to learn about postoperative pain management and to evaluate the usability, user experience, and efficacy of the game. Methods: A computer game was developed by an interdisciplinary team following a structured approach. The usability, user experience, and efficacy of the game were evaluated using self-reported questionnaires (AttrakDiff2, Postoperative Pain Management Game Survey, Patient Knowledge About Postoperative Pain Management questionnaire), semi-structured interviews, and direct observation in one session with 20 participants recruited from the general public via Facebook (mean age 48 [SD 14]; 11 women). Adjusted Barriers Questionnaire II and 3 questions on health literacy were used to collect background information. Results: Theories of self-care and adult learning, evidence for the educational needs of patients about pain management, and principles of gamification were used to develop the computer game. Ease of use and usefulness received a median score between 2.00 (IQR 1.00) and 5.00 (IQR 2.00) (possible scores 0-5; IQR, interquartile range), and ease of use was further confirmed by observation. Participants expressed satisfaction with this novel method of learning, despite some technological challenges. The attributes of the game, measured with AttrakDiff2, received a median score above 0 in all dimensions; highest for attraction (median 1.43, IQR 0.93) followed by pragmatic quality (median 1.31, IQR 1.04), hedonic quality interaction (median 1.00, IQR 1.04), and hedonic quality stimulation (median 0.57, IQR 0.68). Knowledge of pain medication and pain management strategies improved after playing the game (P=.001). Conclusions: A computer game can be an efficient method of learning about pain management; it has the potential to improve knowledge and is appreciated by users. To assess the game's usability and efficacy in the context of preparation for surgery, an evaluation with a larger sample, including surgical patients and older people, is required. © 2020 International Association of Online Engineering.

Findings from research carried out to date on the effectiveness of gamification in educational contexts can be summarised as cautiously optimistic. However, researchers warn that further and more nuanced research is needed. It is generally accepted that matching an individual's learning style with the appropriate form of an instructional intervention significantly impacts upon the performance of the student and his/her achievement of learning outcomes. It is also widely acknowledged that personality traits have a significant impact on academic achievement. Knowing how individual characteristics will impact on the experience of gamification will inform the effective design of gamified learning interventions and enable its effective integration into the learning environment. This research examines the impact that different learning styles and personality traits have on students'; (1) perceptions of, (2) engagement with and, (3) overall performance in a gamified learning intervention developed using a prediction market. The study evidences a range of responses to gamification based upon individual learning styles and personality traits. Findings suggest that individuals who are orientated towards active or global learning styles have a positive impression of gamification. Other results suggest that extraverted individuals like gamification, while conscientious individuals are less motivated by it. These findings have important implications for practitioners deploying gamification. The key conclusion is that, as a tool for influencing individuals and mediating learning behaviours, gamification must be investigated and deployed in a nuanced manner with due regard paid to issues such as individual learning styles and personality traits. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd";"Gamification; Higher level pedagogy; Learning styles; Millennials; Personality traits; Prediction markets";"Commerce; Education; Forecasting; Students; Gamification; Higher level pedagogy; Learning Style; Millennials; Personality traits; Prediction markets; Computer aided instruction";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Gamification is the recent trend that offers to increase engagement through the inclusion of game-like features like points and badges, in non-game contexts. This review will answer the following question, 'Are gamification strategies effective in increasing engagement in online programs?' Method: Eight databases (Web of Science, PsycINFO, Medline, INSPEC, ERIC, Cochrane Library, Business Source Complete and ACM Digital Library) were searched from 2010 to the 28th of October 2015 using a comprehensive search strategy. Eligibility criteria was based on the PICOS format, where ""population"" included adults, ""intervention"" involved an online program or smart phone application that included at least one gamification feature. ""Comparator"" was a control group, ""outcomes"" included engagement and ""downstream"" outcomes which occurred as a result of engagement; and ""study design"" included experimental studies from peer-reviewed sources. Effect sizes (Cohens d and 95% confidence intervals) were also calculated. Results: 1017 studies were identified from database searches following the removal of duplicates, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. The studies involved a total of 10,499 participants, and were commonly undertaken in tertiary education contexts. Engagement metrics included time spent (n =5), volume of contributions (n =11) and occasions visited to the software (n =4); as well as downstream behaviours such as performance (n =4) and healthy behaviours (n =1). Effect sizes typically ranged from medium to large in direct engagement and downstream behaviours, with 12 out of 15 studies finding positive significant effects in favour of gamification. Conclusion: Gamification is effective in increasing engagement in online programs. Key recommendations for future research into gamification are provided. In particular, rigorous study designs are required to fully examine gamification's effects and determine how to best achieve sustained engagement. © 2017 Looyestyn et al.

These results promote a model of gamification that consists of considering the experience of the students, rather than the game itself, and they confirm that a game is consubstantial to its player. Therefore, we argue for the use of the term “ludicization” to emphasize that transforming a situation into a game does not consist of using elements that have a game-like aspect, but rather of a non-essentialistic vision of play, generating a metaphor around the situation to build a reflexive space where the nature and meaning of interactions are modified. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.";"Classcraft; Classroom management; Gamification; High school education; Ludicization";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

A novel board game focusing on differential diagnoses in thoracic radiography was developed. One hundred fourth-year veterinary students took a brief pretest, played the board game, and took a brief posttest as a part of their respective clinical radiology rotations. Pretest results were compared to posttest results using a paired t-test to determine if playing the game impacted student understanding. Students’ mean scores on the posttest were significantly higher than mean pretest scores (P < 0.0001).

The development of this design framework started as a response to complex changes in society and education (e.g. high turnover rate of knowledge, changing labour market), which require a more creative response of learners to the world problems that surround them. Many of these challenges are related to science and it would be expected that students are attracted to science, however the contrary is the case. One of the origins of this disinterest can be found in the way science is taught. Therefore, after reviewing the relevant literature we propose the SLAM framework as a tool to aid the design of science courses with high motivational impact on students. The framework is concerned with the assumption that science learning activities should be applicable and relevant to contemporary life and transferable to ‘real-world’ situations. The design framework proposes three design dimensions: context, technology and pedagogy, and aims at integrating learning in formal and informal contexts through blended learning scenarios by using today’s flexible, interactive and immersive technologies (e.g. mobile, augmented reality, virtual reality). © 2016 The Open University.";"blended learning; digital storytelling; formal and informal learning; gamification; mobile learning; Pedagogical model";"";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green";"Scopus"

While empirical studies on gamification in higher education are showing modest gains in some areas, this data can be difficult to interpret because of the many ways that gamification can be designed and implemented. Gamification is also controversial for appearing exploitative, seeming oversimplified, and having the tendency to rely on extrinsic motivation and learning analytics that may not translate to student learning. This paper provides a brief overview of gamification in higher education and looks at findings from recent empirical studies. It then examines its key criticisms as well as its potential contributions to improving instructional design in higher education.

Gamification has been used widely in recent years in industry and academia as a tool for training and education. Objective: The aims of this paper are to provide an overview of gamification and digital game-based learning (DGBL), review the use of digital games in health professional education, and provide suggestions for future use in pharmacy curricula.Discussion: Many examples of game-based learning in pharmacy and other health professional curricula have been published, however the body of literature on DGBL is less developed. Overall, evaluations of these techniques show that students find them engaging and enjoyable. A recent meta-analysis of studies comparing DGBL to non-game based learning in primary, secondary, post-secondary education found that DGBL significantly enhances learning. Challenges to implementing game-based learning are financial, cultural, and technological.Conclusion: Many areas of the pharmacy curriculum could be appropriate for digital gamification. With more students entering pharmacy school familiar with video games and game-based living the time has come for pharmacy educators to explore how these instructional technologies could benefit a new generation of pharmacy students. As serious games are developed and researched in pharmacy curricula, test scores, student confidence in knowledge and skills, and retention of knowledge and skills are all outcomes that, if published, will help advance the adoption of DGBL into the pharmacy school classroom. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.";"Active learning; Game-based learning; Gamification; Pharmacy education";"human; medical education; medical school; pharmacy; priority journal; recreational game; Review; video game; vocational education; curriculum; education; game; learning; pharmacy student; problem solving; procedures; psychology; standards; trends; Curriculum; Education, Pharmacy; Educational Measurement; Games, Experimental; Humans; Learning; Problem Solving; Students, Pharmacy";"English";"Review";"";"Scopus"

The questions, though, are which gamification approach is most suitable at that level and how to assess its suitability? This paper aims to attempt to partially answer these two questions, in the context of lean thinking education. Design/methodology/approach: The paper offers an assessment criteria to investigate the impact of lean gamification based on the evaluation of motivational, cognitive and social processing during games. In addition, a study is conducted among selected games using these assessment criteria. The study included statistical as well as comparative analysis. The study was based on a sample of undergraduate students learning various lean thinking concepts through physical games over the course of six months. Findings: Results showed different interaction levels between the three evaluation criteria depending on the type and design of the lean game. The reported scores and analysis drew various lessons on how to use gamification in the context of lean teaching, outlined some best practices in lean games design and suggested recommendations in mapping lean games from industrial domain to higher education domain. Research limitations/implications: The scope of this research was bounded by the sample size of students as well as the selected nine lean thinking games. Larger pool of students as well as other lean thinking games can offer further insights and confirm the outlined ones. Practical implications: The presented work will help lean thinking educators in higher education to better understand the student dynamics associated with engaging them in this type pf pedagogical approach. It will help guiding lean thinking games’ designer on how to better cater for this segment of lean thinking learners. Finally, it will aid in promoting lean gamification as an effective learning tool. Social implications: The social impact is achieved through enhancing lean thinking education to a wide number of students. This will positively impact the society through the application of the effective lean tools at different stages, levels and places in these students’ life experiences. Originality/value: This study offers one of the very few applications in gamification assessment in the context of lean thinking. Furthermore, it integrates the social processing criterion for the first time with the classical two other criteria (motivation and cognitive) used in games education assessment. Finally, it offers new insights for lean thinking game designers for higher education learners. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.";"Assessment; Gamification; Lean thinking education";"";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Green";"Scopus"

However, ""gamification"" and ""game"" terms, are still being mentioned as substitutes for one another sometimes in many research articles. Although a mixture of methods are being used nowadays in the whole learning process (e.g. flipped learning together with gamification, mobile learning and infographics etc.), naming the ""whole"" learning methodology being used in an educational project/research only as ""gamification"" (or only as a game/GBL) - is yet another common issue that may lead us to misunderstand the gamification concept. These situations may be regarded as problematic issues in understanding the concept of gamification correctly. The number of educators and researchers keeps increasing in the world which are researching and trying to benefit from gamification applications in a variety of disciplines. Some of these disciplines (such as chemistry, health etc.) seems to be more benefitting and being more successful than others in their project states. Evaluating the level of success in various dimensions of learning may also differ from one to another largely in case of mixed learning methods being used in the research. Thus, in cases of using gamification method as well with others in a mixed manner of methods, the low level of success achieved may have been affected by a number of reasons.

As there appeared a lot of game-based teaching methods, the techniques called gamification as well as differences between them are reviewed because both of them are supposed to be similar in education of late. Another problem with games in education is that some scholars still do not differentiate properly between gamification and game-based learning. This misconception is reflected even in their recent scientific works where gamification sometimes is regarded as mere usage of games in learning process. According to researches, the impact of games on learning process is efficient in terms of developing vocabulary and speaking skills, improving foreign language acquisition, boosting motivation and engagement of students and creating opportunities to apply acquired knowledge in practice. Moreover, implementing games in class environment (depending on the type of the game used) enhances critical and logical thinking, problem solving, team work skills. Using various games in the learning process is particularly efficient for IT students, since it is related to their major. Another advantage of game-based learning is that it can be realized within the learning management system (LMS).

Gamification is starting to play an important role in education with the objective of providing engagement and improving the motivation of students. One specific example is the use of badges. The analysis of users' interactions and behaviors with the badge system can be used to improve the learning process, e.g., by adapting the learning materials and giving game-based activities to students depending on their interest toward badges. In this work, we propose some metrics that provide information regarding the behavior of students with badges, including if they are intentionally earning them, the concentration for achieving them and their time efficiency. We validate these metrics by providing an extensive analysis of 291 different students interacting with a local instance of Khan Academy within our courses for freshmen at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. This analysis includes relationship mining between badge indicators and others related to the learning process, the analysis of specific archetypal profiles of students that represent a broader population and alsobyclustering studentsbytheir badge indicators with the objective of customizing learning experiences.

Background Mobile devices and applications, which have become an integral part of our lives, are used for different purposes, including educational objectives. Among others, they are used in the process of foreign language acquisition. The use of a MALL application to learn foreign languages has advantages and drawbacks, which are important to understand, in order to achieve better learning results, while improving the enjoyment of the process. Methodology The study population included people who participated in a foreign language course and used Duolingo application on a mobile device in parallel. One group consisted of high school pupils, who were obliged to use the application and filled in before and after questionnaires. The other group consisted of people who took face-to-face courses, and chose to use the same Duolingo application voluntarily, in order to assist their studies. The second group answered another questionnaire tailored to more experienced users. The findings were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 22, and a model was examined with Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. Contribution This paper helps to understand the perceived advantages and drawbacks of us-ing a MALL application by students both in mandatory and voluntary environ-ments. Findings Most of the participants found the MALL Duolingo application enhanced the learning process. The gamification characteristics, ease of use, ubiquity and self-learning facilities had a stimulating effect on the process of learning, and con-tributed to the willingness to continue using the application and to recommend it to others. However, some statistically significant differences were found be-tween the groups, referring to the characteristics of the application, among them ubiquity, lack of human feedback and simplicity of use. Recommendations for Practitioners The research findings can contribute to both teachers and students who con-duct and participate in foreign language courses, by helping them examine the possibility of combining mobile learning with a traditional face-to-face course. Moreover, the findings can assist developers of mobile learning applications, in order to include gamification options in the process of learning. Recommendation for Researchers Researchers in the fields of mobile applications and m-learning need to under-stand the factors enhancing the learning process, in order to develop the next generations of m-learning applications. Impact on Society Mobile devices have become an accessory that almost every person in the world uses. Its ubiquitous characteristics allow using it everywhere and anytime. This is an opportunity to facilitate education to people all around the world. Gamifica-tion of m-learning applications can promote and encourage the use of these applications. Future Research Further examination is needed in different cultures, in order to understand if the findings are universal.";"Foreign languages; Gamification; M-learning; MALL; Mobile applications; Mobile assisted language learn-ing";"E-learning; Education computing; Learning systems; Least squares approximations; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Shopping centers; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Foreign language; Gamification; M-Learning; Mobile applications; Mobile assisted language learn-ing; Education";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Bronze";"Scopus"

Being a new form of aesthetic, cultural, social, and communicative experience, computer games are beginning to influence our everyday practices. Many of the processes in social life (production, labour, education, rest, communication) become mediated and playful. Game mechanics are used in non-game contexts (this process is called “gamification”), and due to this procedure, the experience of computer games is transmitted to the areas that are considered to entirely lack playfulness: war, pain, violence, corporeal feelings. All in all, nowadays many social relationships are formed by the game. For instance, the space of MMORPG often becomes a laboratory, where social skills are perfected, the first encounter with the other occurs, and the contours of new intersubjectivity are set. In games humans are even more unprotected than on the stage, in a reality-show, or on the battlefield because they cannot hide themselves behind the mask and have to open their face in front of the other to make the game happen. To begin the game, we let the Other (even if objectified in the form of rules) occupy our being. The article considers the examples of how the image of the Other is constructed in games, how the game space, the media field of the game, engenders certain ethical norms and ways of gaming behaviour. The way we look at each other is is determined by media, and in this sense, the game becomes more influential. This fact cannot be ignored by the social sciences, especially by those who explore media reality. Refs 33. © 2017 Saint Petersburg State University.

Design/methodology/approach: Dietrich et al. (2017) six-step framework was applied to a co-design project involving four groups of 14- to 16-year-old Australian high school students. Data collection included observations by three facilitators, written feedback from members of each group and video presentations of the generated ideas. The data analysis focused on investigating the applicability of the six-step framework to young consumers and evaluating the quality and practicality of the generated ideas. Findings: Sensitization is key to enabling young consumers to become equal participants during the co-design process. Sensitization allowed the participants to engage in the design task in a playful manner, which fostered active participation and creative insights during the co-design session. A team approach based on interactivity and group autonomy enabled adolescents to contribute insights into their specific needs and wants. This was complemented by a trusting environment and the presence of immediately available yet “hands off” facilitators. Research limitations/implications: The findings are limited to one specific sample and design task. Future research is required that investigates co-design with young consumers in different contexts. Practical implications: This paper provides guidance for the application of co-design with young consumers by highlighting the importance of sensitization and facilitation. Originality/value: This study marks one of the first approaches to co-designing alcohol education programs, including VR components, with young consumers.

Therefore, the online platform KOLEGEA, presented here, aims to support postgraduate training in general practice (PT in GP) in Germany through virtual interaction. Methodology: In 2012, the interdisciplinary research project KOLEGEA set up an online platform that any physicians in PT in GP can use for free after registration with their unitary continuous education number (Einheitliche Fortbildungsnummer, EFN). It offers problem-based learning and allows to discuss self-published anonymized patient cases with the community that can be classified and discussed with experienced mentors (specialists in general practice - GPs) in small virtual groups. Results: An anonymous online survey carried out as part of the 2014 project evaluation showed a good acceptance of the platform, even though shortage of time was mentioned as a limiting factor for its use. Data analysis showed that KOLEGEA was used by PPT in GP in all federal states. Patterns of passive use were predominant (90%). This report also describes the further development of the platform (in 2015 and 2016) that integrates an activity monitor as part of a gamification concept. Conclusions: Due to a low response rate of the 2014 online survey and the preliminary evaluations of usage patterns we could identify only initial trends regarding the role of KOLEGEA in supporting PPT. The platform was perceived as a helpful supplement to better structure PT in GP. © 2017 Dini et al.";"Case-based learning; General practice; Online platform; Physician competency framework; Postgraduate training; Social web";"education; general practice; Germany; human; Internet; questionnaire; Education, Distance; Family Practice; General Practice; Germany; Humans; Internet; Surveys and Questionnaires";"English; German";"Article";"";"Scopus"

The responses to 15 images are analyzed using ""Eye Tracking"" and EEG in a sample of 22 young students. The recall and liking of the stimuli is also analyzed. The characteristics of the images are evaluated by experts. The results indicate that there is a different pattern of visual activity between men and women which does not affect subsequent recall. The recall is determined by the emotional value of the image and its simplicity: More complex images demand more time of visual fixation but are less remembered. EEG responses confirm the importance of the playful component of the memory and low involvement processing.

However, mHealth tools, e.g. apps, often have low rates of retention, eroding their potential benefits. Using incentives is a common mechanism for engaging, empowering and retaining patients that is applied by mHealth tools. We conducted a systematic review aiming to categorize the different types of incentive mechanisms employed in mHealth tools for diabetes management, which we defined as incentive-driven technologies (IDTs). As an auxiliary aim, we also analyzed barriers to adoption of IDTs. Methods: Literature published in English between January 2008–August 2014 was identified through searching leading publishers and indexing databases: IEEE, Springer, Science Direct, NCBI, ACM, Wiley and Google Scholar. Results: A total of 42 articles were selected. Of these, 34 presented mHealth tools with IDT mechanisms; Education was the most common mechanism (n = 21), followed by Reminder (n = 11), Feedback (n = 10), Social (n = 8), Alert (n = 5), Gamification (n = 3), and Financial (n = 2). Many of these contained more than one IDT (n = 19). The remaining eight articles, from which we defined barriers for adoption, were review papers and a qualitative study of focus groups and interviews. Discussion: While mHealth technologies have advanced over the last five years, the core IDT mechanisms have remained consistent. Instead, IDT mechanisms have evolved with the advances in technology, such as moving from manual to automatic content delivery and personalization of content. Conclusion: We defined the concept of IDT to be core features designed to act as motivating mechanisms for retaining and empowering users. We then identified seven core IDT mechanisms that are used by mHealth tools for diabetes management and classified 34 articles into these categories. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.";"diabetes; Incentive; mHealth; motivation; self care";"chronic disease; diabetes mellitus; disease management; human; motivation; patient compliance; patient education; procedures; psychology; reminder system; reward; self care; telemedicine; Chronic Disease; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease Management; Humans; Motivation; Patient Compliance; Patient Education as Topic; Reminder Systems; Reward; Self Care; Telemedicine";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Recently, digital gaming interventions delivered on computers or mobile devices have emerged as another way to promote safer sex behavior in a young population. Tailorin these computer-based interventions to their target population has been recognized to increase positive behavior outcomes. In this qualitative study, we investigated whether young female and male adults from two different cultural backgrounds (all living in Germany) would have different preferences and needs in relation to an educational game promoting safer sex. Materials and Methods: We conducted four semistructured focus group interviews comprising open-ended questions with male and female participants who had either a German or a Turkish background. In total, 20 individuals, aged between 18 and 22 years, from two socially diverse and ethnically mixed vocational schools in Germany participated. Results: Independent of cultural background and gender, participants preferred a real-world design with a first-person visual perspective over a fantasy-like third-person perspective. Furthermore, they preferred highly customizable avatars. All participants mentioned the importance of including an alcohol-intoxicated avatar and most participants wanted there to be additional information available about various safer sex approaches and about the use of different barrier protection methods. Males and females reported similar preferences for the design of an educational game promoting safer sex, with the only difference being exactly how the topic of having sexual intercourse should be addressed in the game. Males preferred a direct approach, whereas females had a preference for treating this subject more sympathetically. Conclusion: Educational games offer anonymity and can provide young people across different cultural backgrounds with gender-tailored opportunities to experiment with specific safer sex precautions in a nonthreatening virtual environment, free from unwanted parental control and peer monitoring. © 2016 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.";"Adolescent sexuality; Gamification; Prevention; Serious games; Sexual health promotion; Young people";"adolescent; adolescent behavior; alcohol intoxication; competitive behavior; ethnic group; ethnology; female; gender identity; Germany; high risk behavior; human; information processing; male; peer pressure; procedures; psychology; safe sex; school; sex difference; sexual behavior; sexual education; statistics and numerical data; video game; young adult; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Alcoholic Intoxication; Competitive Behavior; Ethnic Groups; Female; Focus Groups; Gender Identity; Germany; Humans; Male; Peer Influence; Risk-Taking; Safe Sex; Schools; Sex Education; Sex Factors; Sexual Behavior; Video Games; Young Adult";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

The consequences of the use of games for learning are not sufficiently investigated yet, although it is known that using games for learning does not always have a beneficial effect on students. Besides, practical rather than theoretical problems related to use of gamification in education have been more the focus of research by now. It is therefore desirable to consider at the theoretical level the role of game technologies in education taking into account the systemic nature of man’s spiritual life and values and ideologies as its constituent parts. The research aim is to determine the degree of applicability of gamification in education determined by a specific system of values and ideologies every participant of educational process has. To achieve this goal, secondary analysis of scientific literature on this problem was applied, main approaches to gamification were singled out and evaluated. Secondly, using systematic approach it is shown that the nature of the impact of gamification depends on the level and character of the development of a person’s values and ideologies. The research employs basic scientific and special scientific methods typical of social and humanitarian studies. At the same time, the important role among them is played by the system analysis method that allows us to consider the use of games for learning in educational not in isolation but taking into account the role of basic factors of a person’s spiritual life, especially his world outlook. This allows for a many-sided analysis of causes of difficulties which appear when using games for learning.

Nevertheless, the quality of the results in PA depends on good evaluations of reviewers. Thus, the main drawback for scaling up the use of PA is the presence of inadequate behaviours, such as being too harsh or too soft in the assessment, or even not offering a helpful feedback. This usually occurs due to the lack of motivation and engagement of students in the PA process. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a gamified peer assessment model, where gamification elements are used to engage students in PA activities. Two experiments using the proposed model within an intelligent tutoring system called MeuTutor shows satisfactory outcomes. We verified that the average grade given by students to an essay are equivalent to those given by experts, but the time and costs to complete the assessments were largely reduced. Furthermore, the use of gamification helped to increase the amount of students' access to the system in 64.28%; increase in 10.53% the number of essays written and submitted; and improve the quantity and quality of assessments for each essay. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd";"Competitive on-line learning environments; Experiments; Gamification; Gamified peer assessment model; Modelling; Regression model";"Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Experiments; Models; Regression analysis; Students; Teaching; Gamification; Intelligent tutoring system; Motivation and engagements; Online learning; Online learning environment; Peer assessment; Regression model; Scaling-up; E-learning; experimental model; human; human experiment; learning environment; motivation; quality control; student";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

This way, we characterize the educational resources available in the studied environment, and collected data from students interactions with these resources. Our objective was to generate the students’ interactional profile (a model of their interactions). The information, then, is presented to teachers and tutors, who should use it to guide their pedagogical decision-making process. In this study, the types of interactions were used to personalize gamification elements named missions. We experimented the approach with two groups of users from the studied environment (MeuTutor). The data analysis showed differences in the way these groups were performing, where group B was considerably above group A.

Four groups of students were situated in a field trip to learn with different mobile learning approaches (ie, gaming or nongaming) and guiding mechanisms (ie, multistage or single-stage). The experimental results showed that both the gaming and multistage guiding mechanisms proposed in this study significantly enhanced the students' learning achievements. Moreover, the interaction between the two showed that the lead-in of the gaming strategy could significantly improve the learning motivation of the students who learned with the multistage guiding mechanism; on the contrary, their learning motivation could be significantly decreased without the gaming approach, although the multistage guiding mechanism was effective.

The thesis that the functioning of the educational system increasingly detects formal rationality, not focused on the senses, and their imitation. It is noted that the Russian system of higher education refers to a specific type, which can be rightly defined as ""culture-centric"". This type have a number of traits: dominance conception of education as a complex of practices, with the aim of translation of cultural codes from older to younger generations; the idea of the sacred nature of the educational process as a student-deterministic; installation of universality, according to which university graduates must be not only professionally prepared and fully developed; priority of content and semantic aspects of education in relation to formal, often even to the detriment of the latter; belief in the special position of the higher education sector, as well as education in general in relation to other spheres of activity. It is emphasized that the logical consequence of the transition to the formal rationality becomes a management simulation in which real values and meanings are replaced and replaced by a formal reproduction of operations and procedures, followed by their demonstration, declaration and decoration. It is proved that the main source of formal rationalization is a corporate bureaucracy.

The so-called “digital natives” acquire, as a consequence of their early exposure to these technologies, different patterns of work, distinct attention conducts, new learning preferences and, generally, better skills for learning and working within rich online social contexts. So, it seems reasonable that the traditional education systems evolve and shape their practice to leverage those new patterns. Despite the fact that online social networks (osns) are widely recognized as a powerful vector for adding a new social dimension to the learning management systems (lmss), osns do not fully integrate the specific features of the learning process yet and traditional lmss do not exploit the advantages of an active social environment for reinforcing the learning experience. In this paper, we report the design, implementation, and use of a software platform (SocialWire) that leverages on the basic capabilities of an osn and extends the functionality toward its use in very general learning environments. We argue that this approach, together with gamification elements, is helpful in increasing the students’ motivation, besides improving the learning experience and performance. This software system has been in use for 3 years in different subject areas in our university.

Although there have been a number of programmes aimed at preventing scalds in children, very few have specifically addressed hot beverage scalds, and fewer have reported a reduction in injury rates. In Australia, hot beverage scalds account for 18 % of all childhood burns - a figure that has remained constant for the past decade. Innovative new technologies, such as Smartphone applications (apps), present a novel way for delivering individual-level injury prevention messages. The low cost, scalability and broad reach make this technology an ideal channel for health interventions. One of the latest methods being used in health-related apps aimed at behaviour change is gamification. Gamification uses the gaming principles of rewards, competition and personalisation to engage participants and motivate them towards preferred behaviours. This intervention will use a Smartphone app-based platform that combines gamification and behaviour-change strategies to increase knowledge and awareness of hot beverage scald risks and burn first aid among mothers of young children. Methods/design: This is a two-group, parallel, single-blinded randomised control trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of a Smartphone app-based injury prevention intervention. The primary outcome measure is change in knowledge. Change in knowledge is measured in three components: knowledge of correct burns first aid; knowledge of the main cause of burns/scalds in children aged 0-15yrs; knowledge of the main age group at risk for burns/scalds. The secondary outcome measures relate to the gamification methods, measuring participants frequency of engagement with the Cool Runnings app. Queensland-based mothers aged 18+ years who own a Smartphone and have at least one child aged 5-12 months are eligible to participate. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate an app-based delivery of injury prevention messages, and the first study to test the efficacy of gamification techniques in an injury prevention intervention. If this intervention is found to be effective, this RCT will provide a platform for targeting other childhood injury prevention campaigns.

This study, therefore, aims to develop a Gamification Software Engineering Education Learning System (GSEELS) and evaluate the effects of gamification, learning motivation, cognitive load and learning anxiety on academic performance. By applying Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to the empirical research, the questionnaire contains: 1. a Gamification Learning Scale; 2. a Learning Motivation Scale; 3. a Cognitive Load Scale; 4. a Learning Anxiety Scale; and 5. an Academic Performance Scale. A total of 107 undergraduates in two classes participated in this study. The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis includes the path directions and relationship between descriptive statistics, measurement model, structural model evaluation and five variables. The research results support all nine hypotheses, and the research findings also show the effects of cognitive load on learning anxiety, with strong learning motivation resulting from a low learning anxiety. As a result, it is further proven in this study that a well-designed GSEELS would affect student learning motivation and academic performance. Finally, the relationship model between gamification learning, learning motivation, cognitive load, learning anxiety and academic performance is elucidated, and four suggestions are proffered for instructors of software engineering education courses and for further research, so as to assist instructors in the application of favorable gamification teaching strategies. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.";"Academic performance; Cognitive load; Gamification; Learning anxiety; Learning motivation; Software engineering education";"Application programs; Computer aided instruction; Education; Education computing; Motivation; Professional aspects; Software engineering; Students; Teaching; Academic performance; Cognitive loads; Gamification; Learning anxiety; Learning motivation; Engineering education";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Gamification offers several effective ways to motivate users into action such as challenges, levels and rewards. However, an open research problem is discovering the set of gamification features that consistently result in a higher probability of success for a given task, game or application. The objective of this paper is to bridge this knowledge gap by quantifying the gamification features that are consistently found in successful applications. Knowledge gained from this work will inform designers about the gamification features that lead to higher chances of an application's success, and the gamification features that do not significantly impact the success of an application. The case study presented in this work leverages demographic heterogeneity and scale of applications existing within mobile platforms to evaluate the impact of gamification features on the success or failure of those applications. The successful game design features identified have the potential to be embedded into interactive gamification platforms across various fields such as healthcare, education, military and marketing, in order to maintain or enhance user engagement. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper analyzes the structure of the social network resulting from a gamified social undergraduate course as well as the influence that student's position has on learning achievement. In a semester long experiment, a social networking site was delivered to students providing gamified activities and enabling social interaction and collaboration. Social network analysis was used to build the network graph and to compute four measures of the overall network and nine measures for each participant. Individual measures were then assessed as predictors of student's achievement using three different methods: Correlation, principal component analysis and multiple linear regressions. The resulting social network has 167 actors and 2505 links, and it can be characterized as a small-world. All analyses agreed on the potential of structural metrics as predictors of learning achievement but they differ in the measures considered as significant.

In this paper, we present a new experiment where we study what data best characterizes each of our student types and explore if this data can be used to predict a student's type early in the course. To this end, we used machine-learning algorithms to classify student data from one term and predict the students' type on another term. We identified two sets of relevant features that best describe our types, one containing only performance measurements and another also containing data regarding the students' gaming preferences. Results show that performance alone can be used to predict student type with 79 percent accuracy by midterm.

Educational games promote learning and enhance collaboration among nursing students. This pilot teaching strategy consisting of three simulation games was implemented in the first and fourth semester of an undergraduate baccalaureate nursing program. Traditionally, students learn in relatively stable environments such as laboratory settings. However, students' clinical experiences may include patients with high acuities and complex health issues. Nursing students express fear regarding attending clinical experiences. Methods: These gamified simulation scenarios were designed to have students experience the unexpected, to face their fears in a controlled environment. This unique design combined game elements with a simulation experience. Students' assessment was based on their knowledge of patient safety and the environment of care as reflected in our program outcomes based on Quality and Safety Education for Nurses competencies. The aim of this project, gamified simulations, was designed as an innovative teaching strategy to engage students and encourage reflective self-assessment of skills. Results: One hundred percent of the participants expressed that the learning experience was beneficial, engaging, and decreased their fears of the unexpected. All students expressed increased readiness for the clinical setting based on this experience. Conclusions: The gamification of patient safety simulation scenarios was found to be a creative innovation to increase student enthusiasm for learning and self-reflection.

Game-like learning principles (Gee, 2007), collaborative learning in games (Echeverria et al., 2011) and gamification (Sheldon, 2012) are just a few examples of the discussion areas in videogames and education research. But as Rice (2014) finds, there are few available lesson-plans and examples of everyday classroom use of popular videogames. Design/methodology/approach – In response to this need, this paper discusses classroom use of free popular videogames as cultural artifact examples for course content discussions in a Videogames and Literacies Junior Writing Course offered within an English department. Findings – This paper describes the assignment and learning goals, specifically discussing the first iteration and subsequent changes made to aid students in their presentations and learning. Included in this paper are discussions of technology affordances within the classroom space, student reactions and student successes and failures with games. This assignment asks students to find a videogame example to use as demonstrations of the course material as they lead class discussion.

Although gamification could easily be applied to various daily activities, challenges arise when digitizing it for use online with educational applications. The purpose of this study is thus to apply gamification to an online context for academic promotion and dissemination. An online platform was designed to involve faculty members, students, and visitors from industry and the general public to form groups for the mutual dissemination of academic knowledge, products and activities. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed. The findings with regard to the most significant game design elements are discussed, along with the statistical results related to the engagement behaviors demonstrated by the participants. The quantitative data provided by the online analytical tools to examine user behaviors reveals that gamification has the potential to attract, motivate, engage and retain users. The system implementation used in this work is described, and provides empirical examples of how gamification impacts user behaviors in this context.

Users of weight loss apps can also participate in online forums that act as digital self-help groups. These apps also include several features related to game playing or gamification such as avatars, points and virtual awards. Gamification has the aim of strengthening motivation to carry out a (boring) task. We downloaded the 20 most popular free weight loss apps in Google Play. We analysed app descriptions provided by developers, comments about the selected apps in online forums and user reviews. We focused on four of these apps, since they had some special functions. We found that users’ risk management was based on a mixed method that combined quantification and gamification, that is, rationality and emotions. Quantification, which includes self-tracking, data analysis and graphic layout, provides the ‘rational’ basis for dietary regimes, while gamification provides the emotional support needed to maintain motivation and continue with the diet. Our analysis provides support for the emotion–risk assemblage theory and the in-between strategy. Our analysis reinforces the importance of emotions in risk management. However, these dieting apps are based on a reductionist approach to obesity and weight loss, as obesity is framed as an individual problem, while weight loss is seen as dependent on individual motivation. Such framing tends to conceal the social determinant of health and the social and political causes of obesity. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.";"digital health; gamification; risk; self-tracking; weight loss";"adult; algorithm; Article; body mass; caloric intake; community care; education program; female; human; interpersonal communication; lifestyle and related phenomena; male; middle aged; mobile application; nutritional assessment; obesity; politics; public health; REM sleep; social adaptation; social class; social network; weight reduction";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

Problem-based learning (PBL) is the use of problems to motivate learners to apply research concepts and thinking strategies. Gamification provides the learners to actively learn through gamified mechanisms. This study focuses on PBL and gamification to enhance students' engagement in learning computer science. We developed a computer science learning system (CSLS) comprising three subjects: database management, programming, and data structure. Each subject has problem-solving mini games for students to accomplish tasks using relevant concepts. Results reveal that learners have a 95% probability of obtaining above-average user satisfaction, which suggests that the CSLS can be a good vehicle for cultivating the relevant computer science concepts. Participants' technology acceptance and their cognitive load when using the system are also determined in the experiment, with the aim of examining learners' perception while using the CSLS.

It has been defined as the use of gaming elements and mechanics in nongaming environments. While having multiple uses in commercial, military and medical sectors, gamification is using techniques similar to those in games to motivate and engage actions and behaviors. This paper takes a deeper look at techniques suitable for education and e-learning, and comes out with a model that describes the design of educational gamification. The application of gamification in e-learning has been done by following the framework proposed in this paper. This framework combines gamification processes and ordinary e-learning processes in one model called “Gamified e-learning design model” (GED). The ultimate goal of this paper is to expound and demonstrate through empirical means that applying the (GED) model when building elearning platform can improve the students’ participation, performance, and motivation, and thus it promotes learning. The result of the experiment is the demonstration that gamification can promote, engage and enhance learning. It has been proved by gathering data using questionnaires and by examining selected group of students that have experienced the gamified system used in testing. Although most of the results were positive, there is still a need for further research and testing for gamification use in learning applications.

In this study, the entrepreneurial attitude of high school students is analyzed on the basis of the EAO (Entrepreneurship Attitude Orientation) scale through the participation of students on a gamified business simulation. Results have been obtained through a specific experience of gamified business simulation for students from different high schools of the province of Granada (Spain) in which near 1000 students from ages 16 to 18 that had taken basic business and economics subjects were involved over a gamified business simulation competition of 20 weeks. Results show that all EAO dimensions are positively affected by the gamified simulation experience except Personal Control. Thus, inclusion of this type of gamified simulation experiences in high school curricula is highly desirable to, among other positive effects; lower the psychological barriers related to self-esteem or lack of innovativeness that could inhibit individuals from becoming entrepreneurs. © 2016, Ministry Education and Science.

Based on this notion, the academic community is keen on exploring methods that can deliver deep learner engagement and has shown increased interest in adopting gamification – the integration of gaming elements, mechanics, and frameworks into non-game situations and scenarios – as a means to increase student engagement and improve information retention. Its effectiveness when applied to education has been debatable though, as attempts have generally been restricted to one-dimensional approaches such as transposing a trivial reward system onto existing teaching materials and/or assessments. Nevertheless, a gamified, multi-dimensional, problem-based learning approach can yield improved results even when applied to a very complex and traditionally dry task like the teaching of computer programming, as shown in this paper. The presented quasi-experimental study used a combination of instructor feedback, real time sequence of scored quizzes, and live coding to deliver a fully interactive learning experience. More specifically, the “Kahoot!” Classroom Response System (CRS), the classroom version of the TV game show “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?”, and Codecademy’s interactive platform formed the basis for a learning model which was applied to an entry-level Python programming course. Students were thus allowed to experience multiple interlocking methods similar to those commonly found in a top quality game experience. To assess gamification’s impact on learning, empirical data from the gamified group were compared to those from a control group who was taught through a traditional learning approach, similar to the one which had been used during previous cohorts. Despite this being a relatively small-scale study, the results and findings for a number of key metrics, including attendance, downloading of course material, and final grades, were encouraging and proved that the gamified approach was motivating and enriching for both students and instructors. © ACPIL.";"Assessment; Classroom response system; Game-based learning; Gamification; Higher education; Kahoot; Learning and teaching; Technology enhanced learning; Virtual learning environment";"";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

The benefits of using SRSs in terms of attendance, attention, participation, or motivation have been shown in many studies. Moreover, several studies demonstrate that the use of some kind of gaming techniques in education are useful to stimulate students to learn in wider, longer, and deeper ways. This paper analyzes whether the integration of both SRSs and gaming techniques leads to better results in motivation, attention, engagement, and learning performance than SRSs alone. For this purpose, a new tool has been developed for conducting an experimental study with students from different subjects and from different academic levels. A randomized post-test-only control group analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of the gamified SRS. In addition, a multivariate three-way factorial design has been performed considering three relevant factors: 1) learning tool (non-gamified SRS or gamified SRS); 2) study type; and 3) gender. The main finding is that students who took lecture sessions with a gamified SRS had more positive perceptions with respect to motivation, attention, and learning performance than students who took lecture sessions with a non-gamified SRS. © 2013 IEEE.";"Computer-aided instruction; gamification; student experiments; student response system (SRS)";"Computer aided instruction; Education; Motivation; Students; Academic level; Control groups; Factorial design; Gamification; Learning performance; Learning tool; Student experiments; Student-response system; Interactive computer systems";"English";"Article";"All Open Access, Green";"Scopus"

Methods: A situationally responsive agile methodology, Scrum, was used to develop a distributed simulation module using short 1-week iterations and continuous synchronous plus asynchronous communication including end users and IPC experts. The module contained content related to standard IPC precautions (including handwashing techniques) and was structured into 3 distinct sections related to donning, doffing, and hazard perception training. Outcome: Using Scrum methodology, we were able to link concepts applied to best practices in simulation-based medical education (deliberate practice, continuous feedback, self-assessment, and exposure to uncommon events), pedagogic principles related to adult learning (clear goals, contextual awareness, motivational features), and key learning outcomes regarding IPC, as a rapid response initiative to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Gamification approach has been used to map learning mechanics to enhance user engagement. Conclusions: The developed IPC module demonstrates how high-frequency, low-fidelity simulations can be rapidly designed using scrum-based agile methodology. Analytics incorporated into the tool can help demonstrate improved confidence and competence of health care workers who are treating patients within an Ebola virus disease outbreak region.

Students enter medical school with a high level of technological literacy and an expectation for instructional variety in the curriculum. In response, many medical schools now incorporate technology- enhanced active learning and multimedia education applications. Education games, medical mobile applications, and virtual patient simulations are together termed gamified training platforms. Objective: To review available literature for the benefits of using gamified training platforms for medical education (both preclinical and clinical) and training. Also, to identify platforms suitable for these purposes with links to multimedia content. Methods: Peer-reviewed literature, commercially published media, and grey literature were searched to compile an archive of recently published scientific evaluations of gamified training platforms for medical education. Specific educational games, mobile applications, and virtual simulations useful for preclinical and clinical training were identified and categorized. Available evidence was summarized as it related to potential educational advantages of the identified platforms for medical education. Results: Overall, improved learning outcomes have been demonstrated with virtual patient simulations. Games have the potential to promote learning, increase engagement, allow for real-word application, and enhance collaboration. They can also provide opportunities for risk-free clinical decision making, distance training, learning analytics, and swift feedback. A total of 5 electronic games and 4 mobile applications were identified for preclinical training, and 5 electronic games, 10 mobile applications, and 12 virtual patient simulation tools were identified for clinical training. Nine additional gamified, virtual environment training tools not commercially available were also identified. Conclusion: Many published studies suggest possible benefits from using gamified media in medical curriculum. This is a rapidly growing field. More research is required to rigorously evaluate the specific educational benefits of these interventions.

One pedagogical approach to help engage students involves the use of games. Educational games can provide students with a motivating and stimulating environment while providing them with immediate feedback to promote learning. Purpose: This systematic review examines research focused on the implementation of games to teach undergraduate engineering students; it summarizes prevailing features and cites examples from a variety of engineering disciplines. Scope/Method: The systematic review was conducted through a detailed search of Science Direct journals and the Scopus, Web of Science, Compendex/Inspec, and ERIC Education Research Abstract databases using terms pertinent to games in engineering education. A total of 191 papers was included after application of the inclusion/exclusion criteria. After screening those to determine if assessment of student learning outcomes was performed, 62 papers were found suitable for more detailed analysis. Conclusions: Research on the implementation of games in undergraduate engineering classrooms has shown that, despite diverse forms of assessment applied, there is a general trend that both student learning and attitudes are improved by game-based activities.

In this paper, we report the effects of game mechanics on student cognitive and behavioral engagements through two experiment studies conducted in an Asian university. In Study 1, we employed a randomized experiment-control group design. The experiment group (n = 11) attended an education-related course on Designing Questionnaire that incorporated the use of game mechanics (points, badges, and leader board), as well as course activities informed by the Self-Determination theory of motivation. The control group (n = 11) attended the same course and activities taught by the same instructor but without the game mechanics. In a subsequent semester, we repeated the research with a larger cohort of students (Study 2) through a quasi-experiment design (n = 20 experiment, and n = 22 control group). The deployment of game mechanics produced greater student contribution in the discussion forums, but no significant difference on students' recall of factual knowledge. However, we found that the use of game mechanics had a positive effect on motivating students to engage with more difficult tasks, and that the quality of artifacts produced by participants in the experimental groups were higher than those in the control groups. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.";"Behavioral engagement; Blended learning; Cognitive engagement; Gamification";"Education; Education computing; Group theory; Human computer interaction; Mechanics; Motivation; Quality control; Behavioral engagement; Blended learning; Cognitive engagement; Experimental groups; Gamification; Quasi-experiments; Randomized experiments; Self-determination theories; Students";"English";"Article";"";"Scopus"

In Brazil, the digital textbook increased its market share with the Textbook National Program (PNLD, in Portuguese), that in 2014 inaugurated government shopping of textbooks with multimedia and interactive resources. In 2015, some criterial changes in the shopping conditions expanded the possibilities of digital textbooks in public schools. The results, however, are still shy in terms of pedagogical contribution and use of information and communication new technologies, with few academic contributions presents in textbooks and without extensive discussions about how teachers can use the material. Even in the private market, where there are different technological and financial constraints, the scenario is similar, as show this article that has focus on Sciences materials. From an editorial point of view, there are four factors related to these results: cost, time, technological limitations and development experience. This last topic involves not only planning objectives and didactic sequences, but also technological development and the relationship of the developer with the new digital technologies, in which is valuable the idea of natives and digital immigrants. However, some national and international initiatives are replacing the original digital textbook format - A ""PDF linked model"" where textbook and digital objects are clearly dissociated - with a ""embedded model"", that incorporates into the body of the text some multimedia interactive elements. The navigation and the visual appearance is enhanced with this proposal, but pedagogical questions remain typically relegated to the background, behind market issues. In the end, some trends and possibilities are presented to new generations of digital textbooks: digital social networks integrated, responsive statistical methods, eye-tracking technology and the inclusion of gamification in the digital textbook.";"Basic science education; Educational technology; Electronic media; Interactive textbooks; Teaching materials; Textbook production";"";"Portuguese";"Article";"";"Scopus"

A major part of the SC training program relies on simulations, which are challenging and costly when dealing with more than 80,000 soldiers. In 2014, the French Military Health Service decided to develop and deploy 3D-SC1, a serious game (SG) intended to train and assess soldiers managing the early steps of SC. Objectives: The purpose of this paper is to describe the creation and production of 3D-SC1 and to present its deployment. Methods: A group of 10 experts and the Paris Descartes University Medical Simulation Department spin-off, Medusims, coproduced 3D-SC1. Medusims are virtual medical experiences using 3D real-time videogame technology (creation of an environment and avatars in different scenarios) designed for educational purposes (training and assessment) to simulate medical situations. These virtual situations have been created based on real cases and tested on mannequins by experts. Trainees are asked to manage specific situations according to best practices recommended by SC, and receive a score and a personalized feedback regarding their performance. Results: The scenario simulated in the SG is an attack on a patrol of 3 soldiers with an improvised explosive device explosion as a result of which one soldier dies, one soldier is slightly stunned, and the third soldier experiences a leg amputation and other injuries. This scenario was first tested with mannequins in military simulation centers, before being transformed into a virtual 3D real-time scenario using a multi-support, multi-operating system platform, Unity. Processes of gamification and scoring were applied, with 2 levels of difficulty. A personalized debriefing was integrated at the end of the simulations. The design and production of the SG took 9 months. The deployment, performed in 3 months, has reached 84 of 96 (88%) French Army units, with a total of 818 hours of connection in the first 3 months. Conclusions: The development of 3D-SC1 involved a collaborative platform with interdisciplinary actors from the French Health Service, a university, and videogame industry. Training each French soldier with simulation exercises and mannequins is challenging and costly. Implementation of SGs into the training program could offer a unique opportunity at a lower cost to improve training and subsequently the real-time performance of soldiers when managing combat casualties; ideally, these should be combined with physical simulations. © 2016 JMIR Publications Inc.
