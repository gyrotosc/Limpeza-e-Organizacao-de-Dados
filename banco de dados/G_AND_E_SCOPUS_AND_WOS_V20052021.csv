The objective of this paper is to explore whether and how different approaches for designing medical educational tools affect students’ learning performance. Materials and methods: Four versions of an educational tool for the study of clinical cases were implemented: a 2D version, a gamified 2D version, a gamified 3D version, and a gamified immersive-virtual-reality version. All complying with the same functional requirements. Each version was used and evaluated by an independent group of students. The participants (n = 78) evaluated the applications regarding usefulness, usability, and gamification. Afterward, the students took an exam to assess the retention of information on the clinical cases presented. Results: One-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank tests confirmed that the participants perceived that it was at least quite likely that gamification helped improved their learning. In addition, based on the participants’ perception, the gamification of the immersive-virtual-reality version helped the most to improve their learning performance in comparison with the gamified 2D and 3D versions. Conclusions: Regardless of whether different versions of a medical educational tool (complying with the same functional requirements) are perceived as equally useful and usable, the design approach (either 2D, 3D, or immersive-virtual-reality with or without gamification) affects students’ retention of information on clinical cases. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.";"13865056";3;"Mexico";"Scopus; Web of Science"

In addition, computers and information technology have increased educational opportunities and have opened the way to new teaching/learning approaches. Due to this, several concepts from the e-learning, m-learning and u-learning appeared. Therefore, it is critical to understand whether users (students and professors) are receptive and aware to adapt to this new paradigm before deciding to implement teaching learning methods based on mobile technology. Thus, it is necessary to make a fundamental question “How do professors percept m-leaning?” In this context, the aim of this paper is to investigate the perception of higher education professors in Portugal and Spain (Iberian Peninsula) regarding the m-learning, and to identify the needs of professors as they relate to mobile technologies and how they can be used to promote student's engagement inside and outside of the classroom. The main results obtained allow us to conclude that the majority of Iberian Peninsula professors have knowledge on how to perform the most trivial task with mobile devices and a high results about the utilization of both augmented reality and gamification applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd";"07365853";8;"Portugal";"Scopus; Web of Science"

This study held an “understanding sequence” for 20 classes during the 7-week automation equipment class with 30 s year high school students in Incheon's specialized technical high school as target. After the class, the learning attitude of learners was measured through surveys and in-depth interviews. As a result, first, it was found that the degree of preparation participation in flip learning using gaming elements had a statistically significant increase from 65.56% to 78.89%, compared with the traditional flip learning using YouTube. Second, comparing the academic achievements showed a diagnostic assessment of 57.44 before applying the gaming elements and 20.17 after the application. However, for summative assessment, the degree after applying gaming elements was statistically higher at 84.52 than the degree before application, which was 78.86. Third, comparing academic achievement with word game results showed no significant correlation, and it is judged that all students were able to enjoy word games, regardless of their grades. Also, when the average word game scores were compared based on students’ grades, mid-upper level students had statistically significant higher scores than upper level students. Lastly, analysis on the correlation between attitude and word game showed that there is a quantitatively high correlation between the ranking system's competitive spirit and interest. The ranking system increased competitive spirit, as well as interest. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.";"10613773";20;"South Korea";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Such online environments offer alternatives to traditional learning, which is now considered expensive, and time-consuming with varying results. Student disengagement is reported as the main problem for higher education e-learning platforms. E-learning developers employ Gamification to counteract this issue. A plethora of game elements are used in the gamification of e-learning. On the other hand, there are various learning activities used in e-learning platforms. Based on a literature-based analysis, this study thus identifies several game elements suitable for inclusion in learning activities in e-learning platforms to improve student engagement. This identified the most commonly used game elements, and a subsequent questionnaire survey examined real user perspectives on these elements. As a result, a conceptual engagement framework outlining how game elements might be used to support e-learning activities to engage students is proposed. The framework is intended to be used as a guideline for developers and academics seeking to build engaging e-learning systems based on good foundational concepts. The paper thus presents a short review of existing e-learning gamification frameworks and the steps taken towards the identification of commonly used game elements. Learning activities and student engagement factors usually employed in e-learning platforms are subsequently discussed in relation to the development of the proposed conceptual engagement framework for gamified e-learning activities. © 2020. iJET.

In addition, the funding available to higher education institutions is diminishing. Educators have had to become creative in their teaching techniques to assist learners with low proficiency in the language of instruction. Description of innovation: A cost effective board game was developed to assist learners in a pharmacy technician programme to master pharmacy practice terminology. Evaluation: The game kept students engaged and motivated and several observations were made with respect to further game development. Recommendations: A five step process was developed to guide further development of low cost games for use in the classroom that can be used regardless of the learning objective. The five steps are: Plan, Prepare, Pilot, Play, and Perform. © 2019 FIP. All Rights Reserved.";"15602214";2;"South Africa";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Methods A game show-based curriculum was developed from the basic principles of RID, which include the following: (1) distinguishing between clinical manifestations of STIs and management of long-term sequelae of STIs; (2) evaluation and management of common gynecologic infectious diseases, including chronic vaginitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and other pelvic infections; (3) diagnosis and management of perinatal infectious diseases, such as parvovirus, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, toxoplasmosis, and infection-mediated prematurity; (4) evaluation and management of obstetric and gynecologic postoperative infections; and (5) diagnosis and management of acute and chronic human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus infections in pregnancy. OBGYN residents at a large urban academic training program were randomized to either a Jeopardy-style educational game show intervention plus a traditional didactic-based curriculum or traditional didactic-based curriculum alone. The study team recruited participants by sending out an e-mail to all of the residents, detailing the study and consent process. Participants from both the intervention and control groups completed confidence and knowledge-based pretests. Posttests were administered 4 weeks after completion of the pretests. Statistical methods were applied to analyze the data. Results Thirty-eight residents were randomized to a Jeopardy-style game show-based educational intervention (n = 19) or to a traditional didactic-based curriculum (n = 19). All of the participants (100%) completed the pre-and posttests. Pretest median scores were similar between both groups, in which the Jeopardy group had a median score of 48.5 and the traditional group had a median score of 51.4 (P = 0.091). The Jeopardy group median test scores improved between the pretest and posttest (48.5 vs 62.8, P ≤ 0.001). The traditional didactic-based curriculum had a minimal increase in its median posttest scores (51.4 compared with 54.2, P = 0.773). The Jeopardy group had significantly higher posttest median scores and confidence scores than the traditional didactic-based curriculum (Jeopardy = 62.8, traditional = 54.2, P = 0.002). Conclusions A game show-based curriculum improves OBGYN residents' confidence and retention of knowledge regarding RIDs, clinical manifestations and sequelae of STIs, and management of serious long-term consequences of STIs. Additional studies that include longer posttest time intervals are needed to assess the longer-term impact of game show-based curriculum on knowledge retention among OBGYN residents. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.";"00384348";NA;"United States";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Based on the proposed model, we detail the design of a technology-enhanced learning experience in which a series of traditional lessons are enriched by collaborative work on interactive tabletops; four gameful activities are used which may be directly linked to a school curriculum. We conduct a qualitative case study with the participation of 86 fifth grade students across two elementary schools which have a significant minority enrolment. We demonstrate the ways in which the students draw on recently-acquired knowledge, engage in dramatic play, share the digital space and collaborate intensively to achieve a new and refined understanding of concepts and behaviours linked to perspective-taking. We discuss how tabletops, in synergy with constructivist pedagogy and principles of gameful design, allow researchers and practitioners to promote communication, collaboration and perspective-taking in ways that were hitherto difficult to enact in traditional lessons. Gameful design for learning is seen as a multilevel endeavour, which involves the selection of tasks and tools as well as the behaviour of the learners and the instructor as participants in the learning environment. © 2018, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.";"10421629";11;"Cyprus";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Yet, it is still a controversial issue in education and has received several criticisms. The existing literature suggests that when gamification is designed well and utilized correctly, it has potential to improve learning, but qualitative investigations are required in order to reveal how a wide range of game elements fit into different learning contexts. In order to address this gap, this qualitative study aims to explore students' overall perceptions about various game elements in a gamified instructional technology and material development course within a teacher education context. Based on the data gathered via interviews, observation, and documents (n = 118) for one academic year, the study examines possible impacts of game elements and how they should be designed and implemented from the students’ perspectives. The results yielded nine main themes: challenge, narrative, leaderboard, reward, badge, teams, win-state, points, and constraints.

Many researches have developed gamification models supporting a variety of motivational characteristics to provide engagement solutions for different areas. Objective: This paper carries out a systematic mapping in the field of gamification, looking for models with motivational characteristics in an attempt to characterise the state of the art of this field, identifying gaps and tendencies for further research. Method: We carried out a systematic mapping aiming at finding the primary studies in the existing literature, which were later classified and analysed according to twelve criteria. Results: We analysed 70 papers that resulted in 17 primary studies, published until September 2016. Most of them focus on Education, making use of Gamification to increase the motivation of a learning process. The gamification mechanics and elements most used were Badges/Achievements and Points/ExperiencePoints(XP), and most of the studies were not validated, thus not providing empirical evidence of the impact of gamification.

However, recent technologies have provided new opportunities for using games and their elements to enhance learning and student engagement. Objective: The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we discuss how game-related methods have been used in the context of software engineering education by means of a systematic mapping study. Second, we investigate how these game-related methods support specific knowledge areas from software engineering. By achieving these goals, we aim not only to characterize the state of the art on the use of game-related methods on software engineering education, but also to identify gaps and opportunities for further research. Method: We carried out a systematic mapping study to identify primary studies which address the use, proposal or evaluation of games and their elements on software engineering education. We classified primary studies based on type of approaches, learning goals based on software engineering knowledge areas, and specific characteristics of each type of approach. Results: We identified 156 primary studies, published between 1974 and June 2016. Most primary studies describe the use of serious games (86) and game development (57) for software engineering education, while Gamification is the least explored method (10). Learning goals of these studies and their development of skills are mostly related to the knowledge areas of “Software Process”, “Software Design”, and “Professional Practices”. Conclusions: The use of games in software engineering education is not new. However, there are some knowledge areas where the use of games can still be further explored. Gamification is a new trend and existing research in the field is quite preliminary. We also noted a lack of standardization both in the definition of learning goals and in the classification of game-related methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.";"09505849";43;"Brazil";"Scopus; Web of Science"

However, mHealth tools, e.g. apps, often have low rates of retention, eroding their potential benefits. Using incentives is a common mechanism for engaging, empowering and retaining patients that is applied by mHealth tools. We conducted a systematic review aiming to categorize the different types of incentive mechanisms employed in mHealth tools for diabetes management, which we defined as incentive-driven technologies (IDTs). As an auxiliary aim, we also analyzed barriers to adoption of IDTs. Methods: Literature published in English between January 2008–August 2014 was identified through searching leading publishers and indexing databases: IEEE, Springer, Science Direct, NCBI, ACM, Wiley and Google Scholar. Results: A total of 42 articles were selected. Of these, 34 presented mHealth tools with IDT mechanisms; Education was the most common mechanism (n = 21), followed by Reminder (n = 11), Feedback (n = 10), Social (n = 8), Alert (n = 5), Gamification (n = 3), and Financial (n = 2). Many of these contained more than one IDT (n = 19). The remaining eight articles, from which we defined barriers for adoption, were review papers and a qualitative study of focus groups and interviews. Discussion: While mHealth technologies have advanced over the last five years, the core IDT mechanisms have remained consistent. Instead, IDT mechanisms have evolved with the advances in technology, such as moving from manual to automatic content delivery and personalization of content. Conclusion: We defined the concept of IDT to be core features designed to act as motivating mechanisms for retaining and empowering users. We then identified seven core IDT mechanisms that are used by mHealth tools for diabetes management and classified 34 articles into these categories. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.";"1357633X";16;"Australia";"Scopus; Web of Science"

These technologies are also very important for the learning and transmission of intangible cultural heritage (ICH) creations, which include, among others, dance, theater, and other skills where body motion has a primary role. However, creating games can be time consuming and usually demands a significant effort. Therefore, this paper focuses on the design and development of a novel framework for the rapid design of body-motion-based customizable game-like applications. This framework consists of two components: (i) an interface that allows the user to design the game and capture the motion data, and (ii) a customizable game for learning and training using off-the-shelf motion-capture sensors like the Microsoft Kinect. The game is automatically configured based on the output of the game design interface. In order to evaluate the proposed system, three pilot-use cases have been selected: (i) the Latin dance Salsa, (ii) the Greek traditional dance Tsamiko, and (iii) the Walloon (Belgian) traditional dance. Moreover, small-scaled experiments concerning the three different use cases were conducted, where both beginners and experts evaluated the game-like application for dance learning. Furthermore, a group of dance experts were asked to design and generate their own game and evaluate their experience. Results showed that the use of such a game-like application could be efficient, as positive feedback was obtained. In summary, participants found that the generated game-like application meets its objectives; it is generally efficient and satisfactory and offers a novel tool for ICH transmission and education. Last but not the least, the dance experts expressed their interest in developing more such games in the future, since they characterized the game design module as easy and intuitive to use. © 2018, Beijing Normal University.";"21979987";7;"Turkey";"Scopus; Web of Science"

But when the feeling of anxiety is persistent and interferes with a person's day to day life then this may likely be an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are a common issue worldwide and can fall under general anxiety, panic attacks, and social anxiety among others. They can be disabling and can impact all aspects of an individual's life, including work, education, and personal relationships. It is important that people with anxiety receive appropriate care, which in some cases may prove difficult due to mental health care delivery barriers such as cost, stigma, or distance from mental health services. A potential solution to this could be mobile mental health applications. These can serve as effective and promising tools to assist in the management of anxiety and to overcome some of the aforementioned barriers. The objective of this study is to provide an analysis of treatment and management-related functionality and characteristics of high-rated mobile applications (apps) for anxiety, which are available for Android and iOS systems. Method: A broad search was performed in the Google Play Store and App Store following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol to identify existing apps for anxiety. A set of free and highly rated apps for anxiety were identified and the selected apps were then installed and analyzed according to a predefined data extraction strategy. Results: A total of 167 anxiety apps were selected (123 Android apps and 44 iOS apps). Besides anxiety, the selected apps addressed several health issues including stress, depression, sleep issues, and eating disorders. The apps adopted various treatment and management approaches such as meditation, breathing exercises, mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. Results also showed that 51% of the selected apps used various gamification features to motivate users to keep using them, 32% provided social features including chat, communication with others and links to sources of help; 46% offered offline availability; and only 19% reported involvement of mental health professionals in their design. Conclusions: Anxiety apps incorporate various mental health care management methods and approaches. Apps can serve as promising tools to assist large numbers of people suffering from general anxiety or from anxiety disorders, anytime, anywhere, and particularly in the current COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.";"13865056";2;"United Arab Emirates";"Scopus; Web of Science"

When properly applied in educational settings, gamification can lead to better learning. Furthermore, it can be boosted when tied to social networks. However, according to the literature, there are three main concerns regarding this topic: (a) instructors and teachers does not have the resources to plan and develop gamification strategies into their classes; (b) gamification needs a systematic approach to achieve the desired positive results; and (c) inexistence of systematic approaches that connect and help in the design of gamification and social network tasks within these contexts. Thus, this work proposes a solution to help instructors and teachers to plan and deploy gamification concepts with social network features in learning environments. In this paper, we detailed our approach depicting the set of items to analyze and compare it with other solutions that are focused on education. Then, it was conducted a case study over a programming course (N = 40) to analyze the planning and deployment phases. Our results demonstrated that our approach is the first to consider the stakeholders (i.e. instructors and teachers) as part of the process. Moreover, even though there are still some obstacles to overcome, the gamified strategies that were created achieved positive acceptance among the students and professor. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd";"02684012";24;"Brazil";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Gamification is growing in popularity in education and workplace training, but it is unclear which game elements are conducive to learning. The theory of gamified learning suggests that one type of gamification, the addition of game fiction/narrative, can be used to improve learning outcomes, and the Technology-Enhanced Training Effectiveness Model (TETEM) suggests individual differences impact the strength of this effect. From this theoretical basis, this study gamified a training module with game fiction in order to improve outcomes over the original training. Results and Conclusion. In a study of 273 learners, trainees were significantly more satisfied with training enhanced with game fiction over the control text (d = 0.65) but did not differ in declarative knowledge scores by condition. Further, trainees in the control condition scored higher on procedural knowledge than trainees in the game fiction condition, although the effect was smaller (d = −0.40). Thus, the use of narrative improved reactions to training but at some cost to training effectiveness. Attitudes toward game-based learning were also tested as a moderator of the condition-outcome relationship. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.";"10468781";36;"United States";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Even though many studies have been conducted to investigate the efficacy of the integration of gamification to different education curriculums, few studies have examined the reactions, behaviors, and attitudes of learners toward the use of gamification in medical education. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the medical students' learning experience and acceptance of the use of gamification for the delivery of electrocardiogram lessons. Materials and Methods: A qualitative research method was used to generate findings in this study. The data collection methods included focus group discussions and interviews. Triangulation methods were used to ensure the validity and reliability of the qualitative data analyzed in this study. The thematic analysis of the data collected in this study helped to garner insights into the perception of participants and experts about the use of GaMed@™ for the delivery of ECG lessons. Results: A total number of 32 medical students and four experts in the fields of user experience, communication, social psychology, and game design participated in this study. The findings showed that in spite of the negative reports about the user experience and application of GaMed@™, the participants and experts affirmed its positive impact on the increased motivation and engagement of users. Conclusions: The impact of this concept can be maximized by tailoring the game design to foster-positive learning attributes, behaviors, and outcomes in students. However, further research studies must be conducted to investigate the impact of gamification designs on specific learning outcomes in students. © 2019 Tzu Chi Medical Journal | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.";"10163190";1;"Malaysia";"Scopus; Web of Science"

The application will help freshmen learn about the institution’s environment and campus, degree program, and course curriculum before school starts. For efficiency and to elicit high emotional engagement, various pedagogical and technological approaches are used for presenting the content, such as gamification and augmented reality. Awareness of their future learning environment, study path, and course details helps students reduce their fear of failure, and this, in turn, prevents educational withdrawal. In addition to raising awareness, the interactive augmented learning for orientation application saves educational institutions significant time and resources by preparing new students for their educational journey on their personal mobile devices.

Background: We adapted an evidence-based, flexibly delivered program for use with low-income, unmarried couples, for whom the outcome literature is scarce. Method: Couples (N = 443) were recruited from maternity units and began CCP. They completed measures before, during, and immediately after the intervention and again 6 months later. Results: Experience of moderate psychological intimate partner violence (IPV) declined and perceived parenting efficacy increased over time; there was no change in severe psychological or physical IPV. Individuals with lower levels of relationship commitment than their partners showed improvement in relationship satisfaction, whereas those with similar or higher levels of commitment maintained their baseline levels despite being in a period of expected satisfaction decline. Conclusion: CCP showed some signs of helping low-income couples during a stressful period, and its flexible service delivery model allowed these couples to participate by reducing the impediments of transportation challenges, conflicting work schedules, and overall time poverty. Implications: The results of this study suggest practitioners interested in using CCP with low-income couples would likely maximize the impact by (a) focusing on pregnant, first-time parents; (b) integrating CCP within postnatal health care; and (c) assuming that a considerable minority of couples will avail themselves of only up to two sessions, and thus practitioners should frontload content, making other content optional or just-in-time. In addition, nonpsychoeducational elements (e.g., gamification, easy computerized tasks to reduce angry responses, watching couple-themed movies) could enliven preventative offerings for perinatal couples. © 2020 National Council on Family Relations";"01976664";1;"United States";"Scopus; Web of Science"

For this purpose, we designed a cybersecurity game based on cognitive constructivism learning theory. We built the game scenes using metaphors to present the main Cybersecurity contents to the students. We delivered the game in a regular course with two objectives: first, to find the primary design factors that affect students' self-perception of success. We propose a structural equation model to find out the elements with the most significant impact on the students' self-perception of success. The results show that the realistic game design and the contextualization of the game do have a notable influence. They are both examples of best practices in game design; second, to evaluate the learning effectiveness of the game. The results suggest a high correlation between playing the game and succeeding in the course. Moreover, chronological analysis of the performance reveals that the intention to play the game could be a simple dropout predictor. Thus, introducing the game in the educational curricula improves student engagement and consolidates their knowledge on cybersecurity. © 2013 IEEE.";"21693536";1;"Spain";"Scopus; Web of Science"

The use of immersive virtual reality offers exciting, yet largely unexplored solutions to this problem. Taking neuroanatomy as an example of a visually and spatially complex subject, the present study investigated whether academic learning using a state-of-the-art Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) yielded higher learning gains compared to conventional textbooks. The present study leveraged a combination of CAVE benefits including collaborative learning, rich spatial information, embodied interaction and gamification. Results indicated significantly higher learning gains after collaborative learning in the CAVE with large effect sizes compared to a textbook condition. Furthermore, low spatial ability learners benefitted most from the strong spatial cues provided by immersive virtual reality, effectively raising their performance to that of high spatial ability learners. The present study serves as a concrete example of the effective design and implementation of virtual reality in CAVE settings, demonstrating learning gains and thus opening opportunities to more pervasive use of immersive technologies for education. In addition, the study illustrates how immersive learning may provide novel scaffolds to increase performance in those who need it most. © 2020, The Author(s).";"23659440";NA;"Netherlands";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Traditional medical curricula rely primarily on clerkships during the clinical period of study to train clinical skills, while the preclinical period is mainly used to teach the basic sciences. In recent years, the early introduction of clinical skills training has received increased attention. This review aims to identify and summarize teaching approaches of clinical skills for medical students during preclinical years, namely, (1) framing objectives (2) learning activities, and (3) evaluation strategies. Although the clinical tutor's role is to ensure that students receive effective preclinical skills through different modes of learning (lectures, presentations, and problem-based learning), the role of advanced technologies, namely, simulation-based learning platforms and gamification are found to be very successful. To improve the communication skills, there is strong evidence in support of role plays, and similarly, for enhancing observation skills, an introduction of fine arts in clinical skills training was found to be very useful. Medical schools worldwide should give high priority to conduct faculty development programs on various aspects of training and teaching modalities, evaluation strategies, and improving the evaluation of various clinical skills.

Current cognitive training games often overlook the important relationship between cognition and emotion, characterised by ‘hot executive function’, and correlated with fundamental academic and life outcomes. Here, we present robust qualitative evidence from a case study which documents the social relationships, motivation and engagement of a class of ten-year-old children who used an active smartphone cognitive training game called BrainQuest in their physical education lessons over a period of 5 weeks.

Design: The authors designed an Escape Room combining Vascular Surgery objectives, knowledge-based problems and technical skills into Vascular Surgery-themed stations. Groups of 3 to 4 medical students participated in the activity. Data collected included time to escape, CanMEDS roles covered during the activity, debriefing interview session, and satisfaction survey. Setting: The Escape Room was installed at the University of Ottawa Skills and Simulation Centre at the Ottawa Hospital, a tertiary care center. Participants: Medical students in their preclerkship years of study were invited to participate in the Escape Room. In total, 13 medical students completed the experience, divided into 4 groups. Results: Thirteen medical students divided into 4 groups participated in the Escape Room. Two teams used a collaborative strategy to complete the activity and successfully escaped with an average time of 53.6 minutes, whereas only 1 of the 2 teams completing the experience employing an individualistic strategy successfully escaped. Following the experience, 83% of participants stated that the experience motivated them to prepare beforehand and believed that the experience consolidated the knowledge that they had read. All the participants also reported that the experience encouraged the use of the CanMEDS communicator and collaborator roles. As well, 76.9% of students mentioned that they enjoyed the practical exercises incorporated into the experience and 53.8% stated that they would like to see the Escape Room format included in the medical curriculum.

Methods: Seventy-four primary education teachers and their 2069 students were randomly assigned to three groups. The first group of teachers (n = 23) were trained to use a face-to-face method. The objective of the training was that the teachers would be able to implement EI into their teaching to improve academic achievement in their students (n = 645) using face-to-face instruction. For the second group (n = 28), the teachers were trained to use an e-learning gamification method. Similar to the first group, the objective of the training was that the teachers would be able to implement EI into their teaching to improve academic achievement in their students (n = 758) using e-learning gamification instruction. The third group of teachers (n = 23) served as the controls and did not receive any special training, nor did they implement EI into their teaching (n = 666). Results: Implementation of EI into classroom teaching effectively improved academic achievement in primary school students using both methods.

Various workshop designs that incorporated numerous gamification elements were compared with non-gamified workshop designs, tested and refined over time. The improved workshop designs led to increased levels of knowledge retention that exceeded the benchmark values from educational literature. We found that gamification exerts a positive impact on knowledge retention. We tested for the moderating effects of gender and age and found no effect of the former and inconsistent results for the latter.

Place attachment refers to the relationship between people and places, which has numerous benefits for individual well-being. Popular location-based AR games often include elements that are known to predict place attachment: exploration, social relations or the experience of enjoyment in a place. We argue that positive emotions triggered by playing can influence players’ place attachment via the process of gamification. We tested this hypothesis in a correlational study conducted among Pokémon Go players. Our analyses showed that satisfaction from playing and the social relations made during play positively predict place attachment, but the amount of time spent on playing does not. A series of mediation analyses showed that relations among game satisfaction, social relations, and place attachment were mediated by the appraisal of the place as exciting. This study demonstrated a mechanism of emotional transfer between positive experiences from playing and place attachment, which may prove useful in other domains, such as education, land conservation, or marketing. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd";"07475632";41;"Poland";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Following a design science research (DSR) method, we created a gamified, “choose your own adventure” style security education, training, and awareness (SETA) artefact using two formats: text and visual. Both artefacts were designed to identify the security threats that trainees are most susceptible to, debrief them about the threat and its potential consequences, and facilitate behaviour change by letting trainees re-evaluate their decisions. Using a longitudinal randomised controlled experiment, we compared these two artefacts to no intervention and traditional security warning emails by assessing both instrumental (changes in attitudes, intentions, and OSD behaviour) and experiential (memorability and user experience) outcomes. Our survey of 1,718 employees showed that the text-based artefact was better at improving instrumental outcomes, and the visual-based artefact was better at improving experiential outcomes.

Our results come from two experiments in France and Quebec and also from an online survey that was made available on the Classcraft platform. These results promote a model of gamification that consists of considering the experience of the students, rather than the game itself, and they confirm that a game is consubstantial to its player. Therefore, we argue for the use of the term “ludicization” to emphasize that transforming a situation into a game does not consist of using elements that have a game-like aspect, but rather of a non-essentialistic vision of play, generating a metaphor around the situation to build a reflexive space where the nature and meaning of interactions are modified. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.";"13602357";26;"Switzerland";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Following this pedagogical trend, the present study aimed to enhance the face-to-face instruction in flipped classrooms with the use of clickers. A game-like clicker application was implemented through a bring your own device (BYOD) model to gamify classroom dynamics in the spirit of question-and-answer competitions. A series of flipped learning lessons were created for the study, with clickers integrated into question-and-answer activities associated with each of the lessons as formative assessments to assist students in the learning of English as a foreign language. In this quasi-experimental research, the data were gathered using a summative assessment, a perception survey, and individual interviews. The collected data were then analyzed to compare the students’ flipped learning experiences, with or without clicker use. The results indicated that the gamified use of clickers had positive influences on student learning, with regard to their performance, perceptions, and preferences. This study thus suggests that the emerging generation of clicker technology allows for a cost-effective BYOD integration model in flipped classrooms, through which it is possible to seamlessly bridge pre-class and in-class activities and to effectively promote student learning. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.";"10494820";49;"Taiwan";"Scopus; Web of Science"

This context has informed the development of a literature that is heavily influenced by cause-effect framing and a focus on effectiveness. However, in recent years an alternative, critical literature has emerged that challenges some of the assumptions of the student engagement movement on the grounds of student rights and freedoms as learners. This review article identifies the following six critiques of student engagement based on an analysis of the literature and arguments stemming from analyses of the effects of neoliberalism, namely performativity, marketing, infantilisation, surveillance, gamification and opposition. It is concluded that at a policy and institutional governance level, there is a need to shift the emphasis from what and how questions concerning student engagement to consider its broader political, economic and ethical implications as a means of challenging the prevailing policy narrative. © 2016 International Association of Universities.";"09528733";21;"United Kingdom";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Methods: The “Surveys of Multi-Modality Imaging” course is a two-credit hour elective course offered to third-year PharmD and doctoral students. Experiential learning methods including active learning application-based exercises were used to supplement didactic lectures in the form of field trips (with follow-up debriefings), small group team-based tasks, hands-on demonstrations, visual modelling, gamification with problem sets, concept maps regarding given modalities, and concluding with written summary reports and formal in-class group presentations. In addition to standard course evaluations, a pre- and post-course survey were conducted to assess the students' confidence regarding course content. Results: Since its implementation in 2013, 101 students have completed the course with 72% being PharmD students (n = 73) and the remainder being doctoral students in pharmaceutical science (n = 28). Pre- and post-assessments completed by the students the last two offerings (n = 40 of a possible 43) indicated a shift in students' self-reported confidence in discussing imaging modalities from a total of 2.4% confidence (pre-course) to 97.4% confidence (post-course). Also, post-course survey indicated that 77.5% (n = 31 of 40 participants) students strongly agreed that our immersive and experiential learning activities were beneficial to overall learning for this elective.

Games have been shown to possess powerful motivators that fuel a person's desire to engage in unattractive activities, such as learning theoretical material. However, to design an educational game that is capable of providing motivated engagement is a challenging task. Previous research has proposed various game motivators and game design principles to alleviate this, but a comprehensive synthesis has yet to appear. In this article, we conducted a systematic literature review that yielded two major contributions: 1) a taxonomy of 56 game motivators in 14 classes; and 2) a taxonomy of 54 educational game design principles in 13 classes, with linkages to the identified game motivators. As a minor contribution, we have also presented a classification of gamification-related terms and proposed different strategies for applying gamification. The results of this article are available for educational game designers and researchers to use as a practical toolkit for the creation and evaluation of motivating educational games that keep players engaged. Moreover, this article is the first step toward the creation of a unified gamification framework. © 2008-2011 IEEE.";"19391382";1;"Sweden";"Scopus; Web of Science"

GAPc is an online active student-centered remedial teaching tool allowing prospective and enrolled students to electronically assess their knowledge of basic and advanced chemistry concepts via different game levels of expertise. This provides them with ways to correct potential shortcomings in view of academic education. A large number of exercises with different degrees of difficulty, links to additional sources of information, automated feedback, and the integrated grading center are key features of GAPc. Notwithstanding that GAPc is conceived as a distance learning and self-learning tool, it works equally well in a classroom setting. Indeed, GAPc was initially meant as a trajectory for precollege students to remediate their acquainted knowledge of chemistry by easy remote access. Today, on the Hasselt University Campus, GAPc is used in the chemistry summer school for senior high school students, and in chemistry courses for freshmen and sophomores enrolled in curricula with a major chemistry component.

Materials and Methods: We designed the serious game, CODIFICO, as an alternative way to teach ICD-10 diagnosis coding to undergraduate medical students. To assess the pedagogical effect of the game, we used the quasiexperimental pretest-posttest design. The participants began by completing a knowledge pretest on Blackboard. After the pretest, the teacher presented the game to the students and invited them to play it for 1 week. Then, the students completed the posttest on Blackboard. We applied the Wilcoxon test to establish the difference between the pretest and posttest. We designed a questionnaire to evaluate the participants' technology acceptance toward the game. Results: Sixty-one undergraduate medical students from a large Colombian private university took part. There was no statistically significant difference between the pretest and the posttest. However, the game had some positive effects on knowledge. The game was well accepted among the participants. Conclusion: The game, CODIFICO, was useful to teach diagnosis determination, not diagnostic coding. Some of the reasons that caused this situation were insufficient attention to the pedagogical theory, excessive reliance on clinical aspects of the medical training, limited resources, and lack of experience at the medical school to design gamification strategies. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.";"2161783X";1;"Colombia";"Scopus; Web of Science"

By focusing on the learning effort, this system can easily and quickly determine whether learners have exerted the minimum effort required for learning. To do this, the system automatically generates a word game and determines whether minimum learning has taken place through the results of the word game. To verify the minimum learning judgment system, we conducted a comparative experiment on the importance of high-frequency words, a word count verification test for word games, and a judgment criteria verification test based on the length of a video lecture. Results of the experiments show that high-frequency words can be used as a feature to determine minimum learning. The appropriate number of words in the word game for the minimum learning judgment was found to be seven, and the results showed that the video length did not affect the minimum learning criteria. In addition, the minimum learning judgment accuracy result was 82%. This is not considered very high judgment accuracy, but the accuracy of the judgment is positive considering the aim of this study. © The Author(s) 2017.";"07356331";4;"United States";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Programming is a challenging and highly important topic for introducing learners to our digital world. Research has shown that motivation plays a key role in programming performance. Gamification using digital badges has the potential to influence motivation, provide social recognition and encourage learner participation. More research is recommended to evaluate its motivational impact in different contexts. Intervention. This research explores the effects of badges on the intrinsic motivation levels of introductory programming students within a higher education institution. The course is offered during the first year of the programme. We report the results of a baseline study without badges and four subsequent badge experiments of different designs over a four-year period. Methods. This quasi-experimental study followed a pre-test/post-test design to measure the effects of badges on the intrinsic motivation levels of university-level introductory programming students. Badges were designed and implemented. Feedback via focus groups and a post-badge survey was collected. Results. Findings are inconclusive as the quantitative results suggest that badges did not increase intrinsic motivation scores. Contrastingly, badge survey and qualitative data indicate that badges were received more positively on average. Discussion. We analyse and discuss the results within the context of motivation and the programming discipline, and discuss external factors that may impact the relationship between gamification and motivation. Conclusion. Further research is necessary to investigate whether gamification, through the use of digital badges, can foster positive intrinsic motivational results, particularly in the well-known challenging domain of introductory programming. © The Author(s) 2019.";"10468781";5;"Netherlands";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Technologies change the field of education, the way people learn and the way they acquire knowledge; consequently, changes need to be made in the way students are taught and in how their knowledge is assessed when using these technologies. In the context of VR/AR educational experiences, significant transformations are needed; in particular, these experiences move away from local teaching to translocal teaching as the virtual world gives students the possibility to disconnect from their physical environment. VR/AR can be combined with haptic solutions and ideas of gamification to support learning and provide diverse experiences.

According to the literature, ESD affects not only the content of education, but also its process and outcomes. This requires a new learning culture based on participative processes and new teaching techniques. Among the different methods and techniques as typologized by Figueirò and Raufflet (2015), action and experiential learning methods offer a promising approach for teaching sustainability. However, no previous studies have empirically addressed the effects of this approach on sustainability learning outcomes. For this reason, with the objective of understanding the potentials and limitations of such methodology, this paper presents an exploratory study of a teaching experience based on the action and experiential learning approach, and in particular on the simulation game technique. A pre-game and post-game survey were developed to evaluate the students' learning experience of a business game focused on sustainability (napuro). The study was carried out at two universities in Switzerland. The results suggest that the action learning approach, and in particular, simulation and gaming, may successfully generate cognitive and affective learning outcomes which in turn may affect students' development of critical thinking skills. In addition, the study suggests the central role of motivation in influencing students' learning outcomes. The game seems to be more effective in influencing the student's expertise in the subject and their attitudes toward sustainability when the student records a high level of motivation to attend the course and interest in the subject before the game. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd";"09596526";29;"Switzerland";"Scopus; Web of Science"

In this context, our work evaluates the use of mobile augmented reality without markers as the technology to implement a multiplayer game scenario that can be used to improve socialization, communication skills and emotional intelligence in primary school children. The present study addresses the usability of two gameplay styles and their impact on users' communication and motivation: competitive vs collaborative play. The game integrates Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) technology without markers to create a geolocation scenario with unlimited physical space. The results indicate that both game modes are intrinsically satisfactory for children triggering positive emotions such as enthusiasm, enjoyment and curiosity that improve the participants’ mood and help increase the degree of involvement. Moreover, we observed that the collaborative game version has a greater impact on emotional affection, social interaction and interest. In addition, we observed in our study that the quality of the communication in the collaborative mode is good in terms of several factors such as sustaining mutual understanding, dialogue management, information pooling, reaching consensus, time management and reciprocal interaction. Finally, several design implications and suggestions related to game time management, scaffolding, mixed competitive-collaborative modes, dynamic 3D content and active learning, among others, are discussed. The present evaluation contributes to the identification of the most relevant aspects to be considered in the future design of MAR-based gamification strategies in education. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd";"03601315";13;"Spain";"Scopus; Web of Science"

The recent popularization of handheld devices such as tablets and smartphones has made it possible to build affordable, scalable, and improvised collaborative gamified activities by creating a multi-tablet environment. In this paper we present Quizbot, a collaborative gamified quiz application to practice different subjects, which can be defined by educators beforehand. Two versions of the system are implemented: a tactile for tablets laid on a table, in which all the elements are digital; and a tangible in which the tablets are scattered on the floor and the components are both digital and physical objects. Both versions of Quizbot are evaluated and compared in a study with eighty primary-schooled children in terms of user experience and quality of collaboration supported. Results indicate that both versions of Quizbot are essentially equally fun and easy to use, and can effectively support collaboration, with the tangible version outperforming the other one with respect to make the children reach consensus after a discussion, split and parallelize work, and treat each other with more respect, but also presenting a poorer time management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd";"03601315";18;"Spain";"Scopus; Web of Science"

We have invented a card-based, role-playing team game called ‘Braincept’ to help aid pharmacology learning for medical students. The aims of the current study are to determine whether the students who played the game perceived any benefit to their pharmacology learning and to gauge any learning gain as a result of playing the game. Here, we present questionnaire data and thematic analysis collected from students who played Braincept along with our data on learning gain associated with play. Our data show that this style of gamified learning has a positive effect on student confidence in handling pharmacological knowledge and that there was measurable learning gain after playing the game. © 2018 The Author(s).";"23752696";5;"United Kingdom";"Scopus; Web of Science"

There are multiple risk factors that together create an increased risk for children in traffic, some of the major reasons include children’s inability to efficiently and actively scan the environment and look for information relevant to the traffic environment, inconsistent behavior, and less developed hazard perception skills. Traffic safety education is one of the most important means for improving knowledge and skills required for children to behave safely in traffic. This study evaluated a newly developed and gamified e-learning platform meant to promote traffic safety among elementary school pupils in Belgium. Participants in this study were from four grades of elementary school and voluntarily took part in the training. They followed a self-study program at home for approximately 15 min per week over a period of 5 weeks in total. The platform included four modules: traffic knowledge, situation awareness, risk detection, and risk management. For each of these modules, a set of photos and videos were used as stimuli and selected from a database of camera recordings of real-life situations. Half of each module consisted of familiar situations for the pupils (i.e., own municipality), while the other half of each module consisted of unfamiliar situations for the pupils (i.e., other municipalities). A fifth module, “the finale,” contained a mix of the first four modules. In total, 44 elementary school pupils (9–13 years old) completed the program. During the first round of measurement (i.e., the first four modules), pupils performed significantly better in the traffic knowledge module when compared with the other three modules. Further, in comparison with unfamiliar situations, pupils scored significantly higher in familiar situations. During the second round of measurement (i.e., the fifth module), pupils achieved higher scores in the risk detection and risk management modules when contrasted to the first measurement. The effect of gamification elements is discussed and the results also indicate the type of traffic safety issues to be emphasized in traffic safety education for children. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.";"16174909";2;"Belgium";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Some e-learning media that are generally used based on survey results include 53.81% google classrooms combined with other applications that are not integrated with the institution’s Learning Management System. This condition provides research opportunities to evaluate the effectiveness of online learning, especially how students are motivated to learn the method, where the results can be used as a reference in developing and refining the method. Based on many studies, that the gamification model can increase individual motivation in carrying out activities, this study uses a gamification octalysis framework to analyze the extent of the role of gamification in the learning process and measure the amount of student motivation in online learning activities. The evaluation results show that the conclusion of the Likert scale results in a “High” level, while the highest score is “Very High”. As for the octalysis test scale, the average score of 6.5 on a scale of 1 to 10. The conclusion from the results of this evaluation is that the motivation to learn e-learning during the Covid-19 period is quite high and has the potential to be developed. While the results of the Octalysis framework with 8 core drives are still average, for that we need innovation in E-learning which aims to increase student motivation based on Octalysis’s 8 core drives. The results of this study recommend that gamification is needed to increase student learning motivation in order to improve learning outcomes. © 2020.

There has not been any recent effort to synthesize or critically analyse the systematic reviews in the area of educational technology. This study analysed 73 systematic literature reviews, including meta-analyses, focused on the evaluation of technology in educational contexts, in order to holistically understand the impact of learning technology use across different aspects of evaluation. Among these reviews, the most common theme examined was learning outcomes (89%), followed by affective elements (45%), behaviours (25%), technological elements (21%) and teaching/pedagogical aspects (19%). Most of the reviews found that the use of technology improved learning outcomes and affective perceptions. Approaches involving interaction, gamification, constructivism, student-centred learning and feedback were most effective. The analysis highlighted the need for more reviews focusing on multiple aspects of learning technology evaluation, on school level education and on the use of technology in naturalistic (non-interventional) settings.

Taking a child-first (as opposed to a law-first) approach, the study has sought to assess children's legal understanding using digital gaming as a research tool. We have identified as an area of particular strength children's attitudes to gender equality, and we have determined that many children demonstrate competency to deal with consumer-related issues appropriately. However, at the other extreme, we have established that children demonstrate considerable uncertainty concerning the levels of force that adult authority figures are permitted to exercise over them. We have found in the course of this study that children are competent and willing to express their views on matters that concern them. However, they do not expect to be invited to do this in their day-to-day lives.

Previous studies have explored online education of health professionals in Second Life (SL), the most widely used virtual world, but none of the previous learning experiences were related to radiology. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential use of SL for undergraduate radiology education and the involvement of students in SL learning activities. Materials and Methods: We delivered a 4-week voluntary undergraduate radiology education program in SL, based on synchronous sessions and asynchronous tasks, with two modalities: introduction to basic radiology for first-cycle (first- to third-year) students and case-based clinical radiology for second-cycle (fourth- to sixth-year) students. Participants completed an evaluation questionnaire about the experiences after the learning program. Results: Forty-six students (20 first-cycle and 26 second-cycle) participated in this study. They found the contents of the course appropriate (mean ≥ 4.53/5), the initiative interesting, and the environment attractive (mean ≥ 4.32/5), and they were willing to participate in future SL experiences (mean ≥ 4.63/5). All students highly rated the organization, the content, the benefit to their medical education, and the professor (mean ≥ 9.05/10). Conclusion: Online radiology education using SL is feasible and well received by medical students of all year groups. The students participated and engaged in this activity very positively and rated the experience highly.

Methods: A paediatric radiology escape room with accompanying tutorial was developed around key learning objectives set within the RCR and ESR undergraduate curriculum. Students were recruited from two different universities and undertook the escape room themed teaching. An 8-question single best answer (SBA) test was completed before, immediately after and at 2 weeks post-teaching to determine participant improvement and retention of knowledge. The general feedback was also collected. Results: The escape room sessions were held three times, for 19 students (6–7 students per session). All groups completed the escape room in ≤ 20 min. Students enjoyed the experience, assigning an average satisfaction score of 9.4/10 (range 7–10). The majority (17/19, 89.5%) preferred this method of teaching to a lecture-based tutorial alone, although all said they found the tutorial component useful. For the SBA test, there was an average increase in 3.6 marks (range 1–6 marks) per participant between before and after the escape room. This improved knowledge was mostly sustained after 2 weeks, with an average increase of 3.4 marks difference (range 1 to 6) per participant compared to before the teaching. Conclusions: A paediatric radiology themed escape room is a feasible teaching method, enjoyed by participants and associated with an increase in radiological knowledge.

Many academics believe that students expect their university learning experiences to be enjoyable, and discourses of game-based learning reflect this, with a dominant narrative highlighting the fun of educational games. Whether students expect learning to be fun or see a relationship between fun and games is under-explored. To address this, we investigated student perceptions of fun in Higher Education using a thematic network analysis based on data from 37 in-depth interviews with undergraduate students. Here, we highlight five themes that encapsulate what students perceive to be a fun learning experience: stimulating pedagogy; lecturer engagement; a safe learning space; shared experience; and a low-stress environment. These aspects are not unique to games, and we conclude by considering the relationship between educational games and fun, and alternative playful approaches. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.";"13562517";12;"United Kingdom";"Scopus; Web of Science"

This study evaluated the effectiveness of urban tourism scenario game in terms of knowledge enrichment, attitudinal change and platform usability reported by a sample of voluntary university students (n = 30). The overall effectiveness of the game is found generally positive. Paired-sampled t-test results show that this game platform is successful in improving participants’ fundamental knowledge about new concepts, models and issues in the urban tourism context. The nature of tourism study in social science involves dynamism of perception and views, and thus leading to attitudinal changes of the game players although these changes are only statistically significant in one-fourth of the attitudinal attributes. The usability is the shortcomings of the game since this dimension is difficult to control except some technical elements. From the statistical results, the game does not reach a high expectation of usability except the educational design of the game.

Gamification has been used widely in recent years in industry and academia as a tool for training and education. Objective: The aims of this paper are to provide an overview of gamification and digital game-based learning (DGBL), review the use of digital games in health professional education, and provide suggestions for future use in pharmacy curricula.Discussion: Many examples of game-based learning in pharmacy and other health professional curricula have been published, however the body of literature on DGBL is less developed. Overall, evaluations of these techniques show that students find them engaging and enjoyable. A recent meta-analysis of studies comparing DGBL to non-game based learning in primary, secondary, post-secondary education found that DGBL significantly enhances learning. Challenges to implementing game-based learning are financial, cultural, and technological.Conclusion: Many areas of the pharmacy curriculum could be appropriate for digital gamification. With more students entering pharmacy school familiar with video games and game-based living the time has come for pharmacy educators to explore how these instructional technologies could benefit a new generation of pharmacy students. As serious games are developed and researched in pharmacy curricula, test scores, student confidence in knowledge and skills, and retention of knowledge and skills are all outcomes that, if published, will help advance the adoption of DGBL into the pharmacy school classroom. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.";"18771297";35;"United States";"Scopus; Web of Science"

More specifically, this paper focuses on gamification, considers the needs of all learners, including those who identify as disabled, and raises important inquiries about equity and access to technological instructional materials. Design/methodology/approach: Juxtaposing Kapp’s (2012) nine elements of gamification with aspects of accessibility, this paper conceptualizes the challenges and possibilities associated with gamified instructional approaches. Findings: This paper examines gamification in light of potential barriers that exist as disabled learners navigate online courses that include one or more of the following aspects of gamification – game-based, mechanics, aesthetics, game-thinking, engage, people, motivate action, promote learning, and solve problems. Notably, online courses enhanced with gamification elements present potential access barriers and challenges to learners who identify with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, or visual disabilities. Research limitations/implications: This paper initiates an important discussion, and as such, it incepts additional investigations into supporting differently abled learners. Practical implications: By examining gamification through the lens of accessibility, this paper contributes yet another perspective of teaching, learning, and instructional design. Originality/value: In addition to socio-economic factors that may preclude one from engaging in a digital play, there is a larger question of how, if at all, gamification is accessible to learners with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, or visual disabilities or impairments. This paper raises important questions for educators, education researchers, and game and instructional designers alike to ensure ubiquitous access to gamified digital materials in general, and online, gamified materials in particular. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.";"20564880";9;"United States";"Scopus; Web of Science"

To our knowledge, empirical research on its effectiveness in education is scarse, and almost absent in physical education. Purpose: The goal was to explore how Gamification can be used in physical education, and what experiential effects may have on students and teachers. Participants and settings: Two hundred and ninety students (age range 6–14 years) enrolled in four schools located in four regions of Spain agreed to participate. The study involved five different grades (from year two of primary school to year two of secondary school), and 12 different classes. Four physical education teachers, one from each school, also agreed to participate. All participating classes experienced the same intervention programme: MarvEF [MarvPE], based on the Marvel universe of super heroes. The project lasted 15 weeks, the whole fall semester, for a total of 30 physical education sessions (2 per week/50 min each). Gamification was the basic methodological approach used to design the three consecutive learning units experienced by all the participating students. Research design: The study followed a pre-experimental, one group pre-test-post-test design, where the same dependent variable (intrinsic motivation) is measured in only one group of participants prior and after the intervention. Data collection: A mixed methods approach was followed. It included quantitative information obtained from a questionnaire for the older students (n = 161), and qualitative information extracted from the younger students’ drawings (n = 126), discussion groups with the participating teachers (n = 5), and teachers’ diary (n = 2). Data analysis: Quantitative data was analysed using the statistical package SPSS (version 22.0). Qualitative data was assessed through content analysis and constant comparison. Findings: Quantitative results showed a significant increase in the students’ intrinsic motivation after experiencing Gamification. Students’ responses reflected one major theme: enjoyment, and two minor themes: friends and learning. On the other hand, teachers’ responses showed three themes: workload, portfolio and narrative. Conclusions: Gamification, implemented on a long-term basis, has been found an instructional framework capable of increasing students’ motivation towards physical education, beyond the initial ‘novelty effect’. Students enjoyed the different approach, and some, despite their young age (seven-eight years), believed that they have learned (which upgrades the education value of the subject). Four of the five elements identified as central to promote meaningful experiences in physical education and sport appeared in this study (Beni, Fletcher, and Ní Chróinín [2017]. ‘Meaningful Experiences in Physical Education and Youth Sport: A Review of the Literature.’ Quest (grand Rapids, Mich) 69 (3): 291–312.): social interaction, fun, challenge and learning. Therefore, Gamification has the ingredients to foster significant physical education experiences in different educational levels (primary and secondary education), in students with different social (low, medium and high socio-economic status) and educational backgrounds (urban, rural) and teachers with different expertise on Gamification (novel and experienced). Finally, as expected, teachers showed concern for the workload of the new pedagogical approach. © 2020 Association for Physical Education.";"17408989";7;"Spain";"Scopus; Web of Science"

The research has an exploratory nature as it involves the design and pilot test of an application based on gamification known as HEgameApp in an undergraduate program in tourism in the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain). This research study analyses whether students' intention to use this gamified app is determined by their perception of expected benefits (functional, hedonic and social), by the costs associated with the use of the application (loss of privacy and difficulty of use) or by their personal characteristics (attitude towards learning, attitude towards innovation and demographic profile). The results show that expected hedonic and social benefits influence a student's intention to use HEgameApp. Our findings also evidence that students' attitude towards learning as well as to innovation has a positive and significant role in a student's intention to use a gamified app. Finally, the results show that the loss of privacy exerts a moderator effect on the relationship between the intention to use the gamified app HEgameApp and expected functional benefits. Therefore, the empirical results demonstrate that educational community could do a great deal to enhance a student's intention to use gamification strategies leading to the greater application of innovative technological, educational tools in tourism face-to-face learning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd";"14738376";4;"Spain";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Owing to the fact that the group of students chosen for the study consisted of pre-service grade school teachers, their opinions on the use of the Wiki environment along with its embedded gamification elements in their future careers have been sought. Of particular interest were the considerations of pre-service teachers concerning the age levels of a target audience that they believed would benefit from instruction with this particular educational tool. Following a mixed-research methodological pattern, the study was conducted in two consecutive stages. The first stage involved a quasi-experiment and the second was handled as a case study. In order to examine the long-term effects of Wiki activities supported by gamification elements on student academic success, a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical test was conducted based on scores from an initial pre-knowledge test, an applied interim examination, and a final examination. In order to determine the opinions of teacher candidates regarding Wiki activities and the process of gamification, results from an open-ended questionnaire were consulted. It was eventually discovered that students in both the Wiki-only (p = 0.02) and gamified-Wiki (p = 0.00) activity groups displayed significantly greater academic success compared to a control group. Although gamification elements also caused a significant difference between the two Wiki groups in terms of the number of times content is displayed (1670 > 637) and edited (38 > 18), it was observed that participation rates fell over time in both groups. As for academic success, there was no difference between the two Wiki groups (p = 0.92). It was found that teacher candidates regard Wiki and gamification activities positively. Also, it was noted that they did not possess an adequate level of consciousness of the fact that student capabilities are an important factor in making effective use of technology. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd";"07365853";17;"Turkey";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Gamification in software engineering (SE) education is in its infancy. However, as SE educators we are particularly interested in understanding how gamification is pollinating our field and the extent to which the above claim is valid in our context. A systematic literature mapping has underscored the difficulty in fully corroborating the above claim because few empirical data are available so far. However, key trends and challenges have been identified. We found that the purpose of applying gamification in the SE field is mostly directly related to improving student engagement and, to a lesser extent, to improving student knowledge, although other targets are the application of SE best practices and socialization. We have also discussed insightful issues regarding the implementation cost of gamification, patterns in the most often used gamification elements, and the SE processes and teaching activities addressed.

However, theoretical underpinnings of the proposed effects of gamification are lacking. This paper applies the theory of gamified learning and extends research exploring the benefits of gamification on student learning through the testing effect. In a quasi-experimental design, university students (N = 473) prepared for three tests using traditional quizzes (i.e., a question, four response options) or gamified online quizzes (i.e., a wager option, a progress bar, encouraging messages). We assumed that students completing gamified quizzes would complete more quizzes and, through the benefits of the testing effect, would demonstrate better learning. Findings supported the testing effect in that students who completed more quizzes performed better on subsequent tests. Furthermore, students who completed the gamified quizzes had significantly better scores on the first test. However, this effect was not due to students completing more quizzes in the gamification group. Additionally, the beneficial effect of gamification did not persist for subsequent tests. This supports that gamification might work through a novelty effect where its influence may not be sustainable. Further analyses showed that higher achieving students benefited more from gamification than lower achieving students. Overall, the results (a) imply that gamification may be a viable option for short-term assignments, (b) highlight concerns of a novelty effect possibly recommending instructors not to use the same gamification method permanently, and (c) indicate that there are contexts where gamification might not be adequate to target low achieving students. Given these results we call for longitudinal studies investigating the novelty effects of gamification and research examining individual differences moderating the effects of gamification. © 2019";"03601315";21;"United States";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Most studies see gamification as a way of introducing gameful design (e.g., competition and social activity) into behavioural interventions. Gamification is often tied to using new digital technologies, especially smartphone apps and, although these might be enabling, there is no theoretical underpinning for making this a necessary condition. In comparison to other sectors, the design of gameful interventions in transport is under developed. Interventions that have or are introducing gamified designs include road safety and travel demand management initiatives and these have been shown to be more ongoingly successful than strategies which do not employ gameful designs. This paper explores gamification in the context of transport with the aim of proposing a framework for the design and implementation of gameful designs, providing a synthesis and critical appraisal of current practice. The proposed framework is underpinned by theoretical discussion and illustrated by case studies that have implemented some elements of gameful design. The framework is designed to lay the groundwork for greater implementation of gamified design in transport and mobility contexts to take advantage of the potential greater success in achieving travel behaviour change as well as highlighting how existing schemes could be improved and providing guidance for future research into gamification. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd";"02642751";12;"Australia";"Scopus; Web of Science"

As mental health can strongly influence academic performance, addressing the loss of community by transitioning to distance education, midsemester, is imperative. This work draws upon the community and wellness benefits associated with online gaming and applies it to ChemDraw. The goal is to improve the class' wellness and social community while teaching valuable organic chemistry skills. In this paper, a molecule, speed-drawing tournament (Molecule Madness) is presented along with reflections describing the impacts on student wellness and organic chemistry skills. Gamification of ChemDraw is achieved by (1) treating at-home practice as video-game training and (2) using video-conferencing software as a medium for multiplayer gameplay. As the primary focus is placed on education rather than entertainment, ChemDraw is subclassified as a serious educational game. Community is developed by in-game, online chat: observers, announcers, and competitors all interact with each other in real time. The tournament provided students an event to look forward to, helped maintain/improve class community, and developed organic chemistry skills (molecular drawing, history of molecules, and conversational IUPAC) in addition to increased appreciation for IUPAC nomenclature. Although an online community cannot substitute for in-person classroom experiences, this activity supplements the loss of community associated with social distancing and could be extended to enhance community within a face-To-face environment. Additionally, ideas are presented that illustrate how other chemistry classes and topics can be gamified in computer environments (both single-and multiplayer) by drawing upon well-established gaming modes (story mode, maker mode, and speed runs). Overall, this work highlights the supplemental role that chemistry video games can play in learning chemistry: by engaging students in an alternative, yet familiar to many format, classroom community and student confidence are maintained/strengthened.

The goal of this work is to understand how gamification has been used to engage students in peer review activities and to summarize the empirical evidence for its effectiveness. Our main contribution is the presentation of a general model of the peer review process that captures the students’ activities and an examination of the specific actions within this model that have been gamified in the current literature. We also summarize the commonly used game mechanics and the context and year level of courses in which prior research has been conducted, along with the reported effects on student behavior. We find that artifact assessment and artifact creation are the two most commonly gamified actions with respect to our peer review model and that the quantity and quality of both the artifacts and the generated feedback are the most popular reward criteria. In addition, Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) are the discipline areas in which gamified peer review activities are most often reported. In general, while the existing peer review literature reports mostly positive effects of gamification on student engagement, the range of student actions which have been incentivized remains narrow.

Currently, research in applying gamification to undergraduate courses is sparse, which is surprising given the overlap between higher education and game design; students and players both follow rules, participate voluntarily, engage with a feedback loop, and work toward a goal. This study applied game design principles via gamification to an undergraduate General Psychology course at a community college. Results indicate better motivation, improved exam scores, a stronger sense of autonomy, and a desire within students to have more courses offered in this manner.

In the last few years, gamification has been widely used to improve learning experiences in various environments. Education is one of the fields that adopted gamification as technological innovation to increase student engagement since it plays a critical role in higher education, especially in digital learning environments. Today, learning management systems (LMSs) are commonly used to facilitate learning processes. However, the engagement and the motivation of students when using such systems require extra attention. There is a need for an instructor to incorporate digital technologies with esteemed innovations to create an engaging learning environment. Increasing students' engagement is said to be evidence of increased learning. Therefore, this paper addresses these challenges by designing, developing, and evaluating a gamified collaborative discussion environment on the moodle LMS. To achieve this, the students in a postgraduate course used a gamified online discussion environment for eight weeks during group work to complete their term projects. Students' online learning pre-test and post-test data are utilized to investigate students' engagement in a gamified discussion environment. The results illustrate that there is a significant difference between pre-test and post-test results, which shows that the gamified online discussion environment has improved students' engagement. Furthermore, students that highly accessed the online course activities had a good engagement, which motivated students to conduct online collaboration according to the game-feature context. © 2013 IEEE.";"21693536";13;"Cyprus";"Scopus; Web of Science"

The theory of gamified learning (Landers, 2014) posits that gamified approaches positively impact students’ attitudes, and in turn this change in attitudes impacts learning; however, research is needed to examine the role of attitude change in gamified approaches (Seaborn & Fels, 2014). A strong negative relationship between students’ attitudes towards statistics and their performance in statistics has been well documented. The need to help students have positive attitudes towards statistics, and therefore be more likely to achieve in the course, makes using gamified learning, which targets attitudes, an ideal domain to test the effects of gamification on attitudes. Methods. The aim in this quasi-experimental study was to examine the ability of gamified modules in a statistics course to have positive impacts on learning and attitudes towards statistics. Students in the experimental group were compared to previous cohorts completing the same course, but without the gamified exercises as well as published results from a large cohort of comparable students. Results. The attitudes of cognitive competence, affect, value and perceived difficulty were all positively impacted after completing the gamified exercises. The experimental group also had large effects of test performance one semester after completing the course. Conclusion. In line with the theory of gamified learning, these findings suggested that the gamified modules were successful in shifting students’ attitudes in a positive direction and subsequently increasing performance. Future studies should introduce randomization between students and examine the specific pathways between attitudes and performance. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.";"10468781";16;"United States";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Design In July 2016, we instituted a gamified microblogging project using Twitter as the platform and modified questions from one of several available question banks. A question of the day was posted at 7-o׳clock each morning, Monday through Friday. Respondents were awarded points for speed, accuracy, and contribution to discussion topics. The moderator challenged respondents by asking additional questions and prompted them to find evidence for their claims to fuel further discussion. Since 4 months into the microblogging program, a survey was administered to all residents. Responses were collected and analyzed. After 6 months of tweeting, residents took the ABSITE examination. We compared participating residents׳ ABSITE percentile rank to those of their nonparticipating peers. We also compared residents׳ percentile rank from 2016 to those in 2017 after their participation in the microblogging project. Setting The University of Connecticut general surgery residency is an integrated program that is decentralized across 5 hospitals in the central Connecticut region, including Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center, located in Hartford. Participants We advertised our account to the University of Connecticut general surgery residents. Out of 45 residents, 11 participated in Twitter microblogging (24.4%) and 17 responded to the questionnaire (37.8%). Results In all, 100% of the residents who were participating in Twitter reported that daily microblogging prompted them to engage in academic reading. Twitter participants significantly increased their ABSITE percentile rank from 2016 to 2017 by an average of 13.7% (±14.1%) while nonparticipants on average decreased their ABSITE percentile rank by 10.0% (±16.6) (p = 0.003). Conclusions Microblogging via Twitter with gamification is a feasible strategy to facilitate improving performance on the ABSITE, especially in a geographically distributed residency. © 2017 Association of Program Directors in Surgery";"19317204";21;"United States";"Scopus; Web of Science"

At the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, anatomy teaching has traditionally been delivered via didactic means. To encourage more active learning, suitable games (non-digital) and the script concordance test were utilized to enhance the process. The flipped classroom approach was also introduced to further trigger active learning. In addition, the use of mobile apps (digital) was also initiated as supplements for SDL. Feedback was collected based on the previously validated PRO-SDL scale. Results from the research yielded inconclusive evidence to support enhanced motivation among our students due to gamification (P > 0.05). However, it did help to encourage active participation for a “fun learning” experience supported by numerous positive comments. More importantly, the participant's continuous assessment (CA1, CA2, and CA3) and objective specific practical exam results were better than the cohort's average (P < 0.05), suggesting that enhanced meta-cognition, and factual recall had taken place. While it is positive, there are some caveats to note with gamification, first and foremost, that it is tutor dependent. Taken together, gamification could represent a new paradigm for anatomy education, and also an opportune time to change the prevailing culture in the healthcare and education industry. Clin.

The discussion is structured around the used gamification mechanisms, the gamified subjects, the type of gamified learning activities, and the study goals, with an emphasis on the reliability and validity of the reported outcomes. To improve our understanding and offer a more realistic picture of the progress of gamification in education, consistent with the presented evidence, we examine both the outcomes reported in the papers and how they have been obtained. While the gamification in education is still a growing phenomenon, the review reveals that (i) insufficient evidence exists to support the long-term benefits of gamification in educational contexts; (ii) the practice of gamifying learning has outpaced researchers’ understanding of its mechanisms and methods; (iii) the knowledge of how to gamify an activity in accordance with the specifics of the educational context is still limited. The review highlights the need for systematically designed studies and rigorously tested approaches confirming the educational benefits of gamification, if gamified learning is to become a recognized instructional approach. © 2017, The Author(s).";"23659440";179;"United States";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Practical software development courses and projects are inherently motivating to students, as they provide necessary elements such as agency, relatedness, and the strong sense of competence upon completing software engineering tasks. In contrast, reading research articles and technical white papers feels dry and non-engaging. Nevertheless, a well-balanced MSc programme curriculum covers both, learning through construction and practical courses as well as research courses. The main motivation for the development of game-centric approaches to the research aspects of curriculum is to improve students’ interest and engagement with those courses. In this paper, we present the methodology and initial evaluations from three gamification strategies used in the Master's degree programme. These are: the game of reading and discussing research articles (GoRaD), the game of arguing and counter-arguing, and combining research and practice. The paper presents our experimentation and initial evaluations of the use of those strategies, as well as plans for future development and enhancements. © 2018 The Authors.

Gamified instruction is touted as a motivational alternative for learning that increases learner autonomy, but research is lacking into its educational merit beyond those claims. This study measured the extent to which a gamified English as a foreign language classroom adhered to 21 principles of good education proposed by Mind, Brain, and Education (MBE) researchers in comparison to a traditional classroom. It also explored the claim that gamification promotes greater learner autonomy. Two sections of a college English class in Ecuador were used in this study. One was gamified and the other used a traditional education model. Both groups completed a 22 Likert Scale item questionnaire which correlated questions with each MBE principle and one question about perceived autonomy. The teacher and the students also provided comments about the experience. The data showed that the gamified group had higher rankings of perceived adherence to all of the 21 principles and a statement about autonomy with 14 of them being significantly higher. The qualitative data also supported the greater perceived adherence to MBE principles and an increase in perceived autonomy amongst students from the gamified group. It was concluded that gamified instruction did provide a learning environment that adhered more closely to proposals made by MBE researchers for good education and did create an atmosphere where students felt greater control of their learning. © 2020 ACTFL";"0015718X";NA;"United States";"Scopus; Web of Science"

To date, despite growing interest and some initial attempts, their potential to engage consumers in energy efficiency behaviours has been understudied. To provide an overview of serious games and gamification to engage individuals in pro-environmental behaviours for energy efficiency, a computer-based search for relevant publications was performed in several databases. After applying the inclusion criteria and removing duplicates, 10 papers were included in this systematic review. Results showed that serious games and gamification have been used in three different areas related to energy efficiency: environmental education, consumption awareness, and pro-environmental behaviours. This review also showed that applied gaming interventions can be used in more than one of these three areas (comprehensive interventions). The main observation to be drawn from this review is that both serious games and gamification can foster energy-saving behaviours and vary widely in terms of type of games and of features that might be appealing and motivating. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd";"22146296";56;"Italy";"Scopus; Web of Science"

These systems can deliver high-level multisensory learning experiences that are important in the teaching of many subjects, especially those involving abstract concepts or requiring spatial skills, such as organic chemistry. Haptic experiences with VR, however, remain a challenge. In addition, development has focused on general entertainment/gaming; VR systems in chemistry implement simulations of the chemistry laboratory and other advanced systems whereas those that support safe, game-like, immersive and multisensory learning of organic chemistry with haptics at pre-university education levels are scarce. We developed the VR Multisensory Classroom (VRMC) as an immersive learning environment within a VR head-mounted display, where learners employ hand movements to build hydrocarbon molecules and experience haptic feedback through gloves with built-in sensors and hand-tracking with the Leap Motion system. We report here the evaluation of the first prototype by learners from diverse backgrounds who reported on the ability of the VRMC to support high engagement, motivation, interest and organic chemistry learning as well as diverse learning styles.

EPCs are traditionally visualized as 2D graphs and their size varies with the complexity of the process. While process modeling experts are used to interpreting complex 2D EPCs, in certain scenarios such as, for example, professional training or education, also novice users inexperienced in interpreting 2D EPC data are facing the challenge of learning and understanding complex process models. To communicate process knowledge in an effective yet motivating and interesting way, we propose a novel virtual reality (VR) interface for non-expert users. Our proposed system turns the exploration of arbitrarily complex EPCs into an interactive and multi-sensory VR experience. It automatically generates a virtual 3D environment from a process model and lets users explore processes through a combination of natural walking and teleportation. Our immersive interface leverages basic gamification in the form of a logical walkthrough mode to motivate users to interact with the virtual process. The generated user experience is entirely novel in the field of immersive data exploration and supported by a combination of visual, auditory, vibrotactile and passive haptic feedback. In a user study with N = 27 novice users, we evaluate the effect of our proposed system on process model understandability and user experience, while comparing it to a traditional 2D interface on a tablet device. The results indicate a tradeoff between efficiency and user interest as assessed by the UEQ novelty subscale, while no significant decrease in model understanding performance was found using the proposed VR interface.

This study describes and evaluates the Engaging an Interdisciplinary Team for NSCLC (GAIN 3.0) experiential learning-based educational curriculum. Methods: GAIN 3.0 was designed to enhance interdisciplinary collaboration for effective NSCLC diagnosis, assessment, and treatment. The program used a flipped classroom model that included an e-learning component prior to a live 6-hour interactive program. The interactive program included hands-on simulations, small group workshops, gamification, and case discussions. Participants included academic and community members of multidisciplinary lung cancer teams. Assessments included an online baseline survey, a pretest and posttest, a program evaluation, a long-term survey (LTS), and on-site faculty evaluation of participants. Results: Of 416 attendees to 13 live GAIN 3.0 programs (nine in the United States and four in Europe), 304 (73%) completed the pretest and 187 (45%) completed the posttest. Out of a perfect score of 12 points, program participants had a mean test score of 6.3 ± 2.1 on the pretest (52%) and 7.8 ± 2.1 on the posttest (65%) (P =.03). There was an overall knowledge increase of 13% from pretest to posttest. Most LTS respondents (65%) rated the GAIN 3.0 live programs as “high impact.” On the LTS, the areas with the greatest gains in participants who had very high confidence were communication across disciplines, use of a team-based approach, and personalized treatment. Conclusions: GAIN 3.0 was a highly successful interdisciplinary activity that improved participants’ knowledge, competence, and likely the clinical care provided to patients with NSCLC. © 2017 American College of Chest Physicians";"00123692";4;"United States";"Scopus; Web of Science"

However, empirical studies have reported several problems that may occur with flipped classroom activities, including the failure of students to access out-of-class learning materials. Students who do not complete out-of-class work benefit little from the subsequent in-class discussion and problem-solving activities. This study offers a new contribution by exploring whether gamification could be a strategy to motivate students to participate in more out-of-class activities without forfeiting quality of work. We applied crucial aspects of five motivation theories to propose a goal-access-feedback-challenge-collaboration (GAFCC) gamification design model. We then implemented and tested this theory-driven model in two quasi-experimental studies involving postgraduate students. Collective results from the two experiments revealed that (a) the GAFCC class completed significantly more pre- and post-class activities than the control class and (b) the GAFCC class produced higher quality work than the control class. Participants’ perceptions of gamification were also collected through interviews, and reported in this study. This evidence supports a call for further research into the use of the GAFCC model in flipped classroom implementation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd";"03601315";34;"Hong Kong";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Implicit skills such as abnormality detection require repeated practice on clinical service and have few digital substitutes. Using mechanics traditionally deployed in video games such as clearly defined goals, rapid-fire levels, and narrow time constraints may be an effective way to teach implicit skills. Materials and Methods We created a freely available, online module to evaluate the ability of individuals to differentiate between normal and abnormal chest radiographs by implementing mechanics, including instantaneous feedback, rapid-fire cases, and 15-second timers. Volunteer subjects completed the modules and were separated based on formal experience with chest radiography. Performance between training and testing sets were measured for each group, and a survey was administered after each session. Results The module contained 74 cases and took approximately 20 minutes to complete. Thirty-two cases were normal radiographs and 56 cases were abnormal. Of the 60 volunteers recruited, 25 were “never trained” and 35 were “previously trained.” “Never trained” users scored 21.9 out of 37 during training and 24.0 out of 37 during testing (59.1% vs 64.9%, P value <.001). “Previously trained” users scored 28.0 out of 37 during training and 28.3 out of 37 during testing phases (75.6% vs 76.4%, P value =.56). Survey results showed that 87% of all subjects agreed the module is an efficient way of learning, and 83% agreed the rapid-fire module is valuable for medical students. Conclusions A gamified online module may improve the abnormality detection rates of novice interpreters of chest radiography, although experienced interpreters are less likely to derive similar benefits.

Background: The family nurse practitioner program uses graduate Health Education Systems Incorporated examination as a quality indicator and program benchmark. A downward trend in Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores stimulated a need for change. Two strategies were implemented to enhance engagement and improve synthesis of clinical information. Case-based learning and gamification involves the use of game thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts to engage users in solving problems while the case-based discussions act as formative assessment tool, providing information on student's progress and development. Objectives: To assess the implementation of innovative strategies on the Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores and to enhance students engagement and synthesis of clinical information. Method: Case presentations were created in the Learning Management System an online program, for every module. Interwoven throughout the module are various game elements. The game elements include voluntary participation with immediate feedback that can be both positive and negative and provides a social connection. The student has the freedom to fail and the freedom to choose without significant repercussions. Results: The results showed examination scores increased significantly. Using a one-way analysis of variance to compare Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores between semester cohorts of students, followed by a post hoc pairwise comparison a statistically significant difference (p <.001) between previous semesters was identified. Conclusion: Although there are many approaches for online learning, using case presentations can mirror different social and cultural situations to challenge the learner. Case-based discussion and gamification strategies are effective in engaging students in a challenging environment. Student responded positively to case-base presentation with game elements.

The questions, though, are which gamification approach is most suitable at that level and how to assess its suitability? This paper aims to attempt to partially answer these two questions, in the context of lean thinking education. Design/methodology/approach: The paper offers an assessment criteria to investigate the impact of lean gamification based on the evaluation of motivational, cognitive and social processing during games. In addition, a study is conducted among selected games using these assessment criteria. The study included statistical as well as comparative analysis. The study was based on a sample of undergraduate students learning various lean thinking concepts through physical games over the course of six months. Findings: Results showed different interaction levels between the three evaluation criteria depending on the type and design of the lean game. The reported scores and analysis drew various lessons on how to use gamification in the context of lean teaching, outlined some best practices in lean games design and suggested recommendations in mapping lean games from industrial domain to higher education domain. Research limitations/implications: The scope of this research was bounded by the sample size of students as well as the selected nine lean thinking games. Larger pool of students as well as other lean thinking games can offer further insights and confirm the outlined ones. Practical implications: The presented work will help lean thinking educators in higher education to better understand the student dynamics associated with engaging them in this type pf pedagogical approach. It will help guiding lean thinking games’ designer on how to better cater for this segment of lean thinking learners. Finally, it will aid in promoting lean gamification as an effective learning tool. Social implications: The social impact is achieved through enhancing lean thinking education to a wide number of students. This will positively impact the society through the application of the effective lean tools at different stages, levels and places in these students’ life experiences. Originality/value: This study offers one of the very few applications in gamification assessment in the context of lean thinking. Furthermore, it integrates the social processing criterion for the first time with the classical two other criteria (motivation and cognitive) used in games education assessment. Finally, it offers new insights for lean thinking game designers for higher education learners. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.";"20404166";12;"United States";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Location-based games (geogames) have been established following mainly a ‘seek-and-find’ game-mechanic, challenging mechanics like simulations are rarely used. We describe an approach for creating an educational location-based game (geogame). The central design problem consists in integrating an ecological simulation into the location-based game flow. We show how to combine these two game mechanics by simplifying complex simulations while maintaining their validity. In an empirical study we evaluate our geogame with secondary school students (N = 329). Our quasi-experimental pre-post-test design focuses on the game-related enjoyment provided by a simplified simulation task within a geogame compared to a more complex desktop simulation and to a geogame without simulation. The results show that the players of the Geogame spend much less time on interacting with the simulation than on other tasks. Nevertheless, the simulation within the geogame contributes positively to the game playing experience. Player enjoyment is even found to be slightly higher in the simulation geogame than in the indoor simulation. A critical threshold of time for using simulations within location-based game mechanics is discussed and related design-pattern for geogames are presented to support educators and game developers in the co-design of challenging location-based games.

This exploratory study is focused on a particular part of corporate applications – using gamification to empower knowledge workers and to help them to interact with each other. Based on a review of the extant literature and an exploratory case study, we conceptualise different ways in which gamification supports knowledge workers and influences the dynamics of their interactions. The case study we present is that of online retailer Zappos who have been pioneers in this field. This paper is intended as the beginning of a journey towards utilising gamification in various aspects of knowledge work. Through studying the Zappos case, we draw out key learning points that can be used by other organisations in their journey to use gamification to empower knowledge workers. The paper also identifies areas for further research relevant to expert and intelligent systems, including the potential for synergies between gamification and intelligent systems, and the use of gamification in intelligent systems implementation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd";"09574174";2;"United Kingdom";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Many complications can arise if diabetes is poorly managed. Hence, the need for adequate knowledge, skills, and ability to care for oneself, known as diabetes self-care management, is needed to reduce complication rates. We used an interactive platform that incorporates principles of gamification to enhance user engagement to enhance diabetes knowledge. The purpose of this descriptive pilot study was to discover what adult patients with diabetes thought about this novel educational approach to diabetes education. Materials and Methods: We collected focus group data from participants at a diabetes clinic after they played an interactive diabetes trivia game, on our software platform (Kaizen Education). Transcripts were coded and common themes were identified. Results: We conducted 9 focus groups that included 33 adult (age >18) participants who had diabetes. An overarching theme of play/gaming as a form of learning was apparent, and after analyzing the coding several themes emerged, including preferences and desired environments (clinic and home) for learning, desired players (including family, significant others), and a good balance of question difficulty. Conclusions: Participants were overwhelmingly positive about gamified education and felt empowered to lead discussions with their health care providers about diabetes self-care education, in a sense ""flipping"" the traditional clinic patient education paradigm. These results suggested that a flipped clinic approach could be beneficial, empowering, and engaging for patients. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.";"2161783X";NA;"United States";"Scopus; Web of Science"

We surveyed 139 students aged 18–31 years (M = 20 years, SD = 1.5) enrolled in an undergraduate informatics course focused on social networking technologies. Surveys were conducted at 3 time points during the course (beginning, middle, and end). Overall, we found positive trends with respect to students' perceptions of gamification's impact on their learning, achievement, and engagement in the course material. Although students who played and identified variously with recreational games were more alike than not, we did uncover one notable difference with respect to how students' gaming frequency impacted their engagement in the course. Nongamers expressed somewhat less motivation to do well in the course than frequent gamers. For all other measures of engagement, however, nongamers appeared to be equally engaged by the gamified format of the course as gamers. There were virtually no differences between male and female students' perceptions of gamification. This study contributes new insight into the conditions under which gamification succeeds or fails in educational settings. These insights will be useful to designers and instructors of gamified learning environments as they seek to engage and support a variety of learners. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd";"02664909";15;"United States";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Because simulation can provide substantial quantitative participant feedback, leaderboards can be used, not only locally but also in a multidepartment, multicenter fashion. Quick Response (QR) codes can be integrated to allow participants to access and upload data. We present the development, implementation, and initial evaluation of an online leaderboard employing principles of gamification using points, badges, and leaderboards designed to enhance competition among healthcare providers. Method This article details the fundamentals behind the development and implementation of a user-friendly, online, multinational leaderboard that employs principles of gamification to enhance competition and integrates a QR code system to promote both self-reporting of performance data and data integrity. An open-ended survey was administered to capture perceptions of leaderboard implementation. Results Conceptual step-by-step instructions detailing how to apply the QR code system to any leaderboard using simulated or real performance metrics are outlined using an illustrative example of a leaderboard that employed simulated cardiopulmonary resuscitation performance scores to compare participants across 17 hospitals in 4 countries for 16 months. The following three major descriptive categories that captured perceptions of leaderboard implementation emerged from initial evaluation data from 10 sites: (1) competition, (2) longevity, and (3) perceived deficits. Conclusions A well-designed leaderboard should be user-friendly and encompass best practices in gamification principles while collecting and storing data for research analyses. Easy storage and export of data allow for longitudinal record keeping that can be leveraged both to track compliance and to enable social competition.

Firstly, this research aims at helping countries implement an equitable, innovative and context-appropriate stay-home game plan for the millions of disadvantaged and under-privileged students severely affected by the forfeiture of school closures; and secondly, this study proclaims that the burgeoning popularity of gamification has the potential to lay the bedrock foundation for ‘Literacy in the New Norm’. Design/methodology/approach: The temporal closure of schools around the world to limit the spread of the COVID-19 has resulted in massive educational disruptions triggering adverse effects and bringing much of education under grave threat. Through a review of the current empirical and conceptual literature, this study proposes a new gamification concept in a non-technology environment. Findings: Well underway are global dialogues that hold conversations on implementing mitigation strategies to counter the looming global health crisis. This has generated the impetus for a more concerted effort by concerned governments and international organizations to identify appropriate solutions for the continuity of learning so that the learning never stops. While educators and learners plunge further into the core of reconstructing education, the authors recognize that the fundamentals of technology and virtual connectivity have all along contributed to the multi-faceted e-learning stage set. However, concerns regarding the paradigm shift to remote online learning would certainly exacerbate inequalities cardinally felt across disadvantaged communities around the globe. Originality/value: As the world is currently bound by strict isolation measures, learners of all ages have been relegated to the confines of their homes. For the most part, the stark realities of technological mishaps that have befallen underprivileged school children, serve as a reminder to help target children all over the world who are in most peril of losing ground in terms of continued education. It is on these grounds that the criterion set out in this article elucidates the nature and scope of a supplementary stay-home game plan detailing the use of game affordances that bear intelligently in the creation of home-based activities for parents to give it their best effort in fostering a collaborative and meaningful parent-child relationship that spawns the new language of literacy in the new norm. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.";"23985348";1;"Hong Kong";"Scopus; Web of Science"

The ubiquity of smartphone use and app methodology, as Grant argues, have the potential to disrupt racial knowledges and facilitate anti-racist action. I use Nicholas Mirzoeff’s ‘zones of appearance and non-appearance’ and Derek Hook’s discussion of ‘racialising embodiment’ to discuss the potential of one such app, Everyday Racism, to challenge and disrupt white supremacy. The Australian-based app uses gamification to encourage users to participate in ‘bystander anti-racism’. However, by failing to question the neutrality of the default white bystander, the app risks reproducing hegemonic constellations of white agency versus racialized inaction. I argue that, in the zone of appearance, it is not enough to make racism apparent. It is necessary to appear.

Answering our research question, “What guidelines may provide to future research, the key themes and concepts found in published scientific papers on gamification?”, we conclude that the researchers identified eight themes (gamification; game; use; users; business; points; engagement; learning) and twenty-eight related concepts. The present systematic review contributes to establishing possible guidelines for prospective studies, based on the analyzed papers, considering particularly their 'Conclusions' and on the 'Future research' sections, integrating game design contents in business, learning and education.

Therefore, while coming to traditional classrooms, it is required to call for different forms of teaching that are more motivating and engaging for them. One approach to this problem is combining games and education. Gamification could be defined as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts. The research gap in the literature could be found in requiring more experimental studies assessing if gamification can improve learning outcomes. To this end, this paper further contributes to determining if a gamified social e-learning platform can improve the learning performance and engagement of MSc students. The developed platform combined submission of activities with points, achievements, leaderboards, and rewards (with a virtual store) and social elements such as friends, forums, Q&A, blogs, and microblogging. Results show that, indeed, social gamification is a suitable technique to improve the learning outcome of students, at least for those skills related to programming, providing more communication skills and producing more engagement and motivation while using the platform. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.";"10613773";3;"Spain";"Scopus; Web of Science"

However, many of these applications fail to achieve the desired benefits of gamification, mainly because of a poor design. Objective: This paper explores the conceptualization, implementation and monitoring phases of meaningful gamification strategies and proposes a solution for strategy experts that hides the implementation details and helps them focus only on what is crucial for the success of the strategy. The solution makes use of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology. Method: An easy-to-use graphical editor is used to provide the high-level models that represent the design of the gamification strategy and its deployment and monitoring. These models contain the event pattern definitions to be automatically transformed into code. This code is then deployed both in a CEP engine to detect the conditions expressed in such patterns and in an enterprise service bus to execute the corresponding pattern actions. Results: The paper reports on the use of both a graphical modeling editor for gamification domain definition and a graphical modeling editor for gamification strategy design, monitoring and code generation in event-based systems. It also shows how the proposal can be used to design and automate the implementation and monitoring of a gamification strategy in an educational domain supported by a well-known Learning Management System (LMS) such as Moodle. Conclusion: It can be concluded that this unprecedented model-driven approach leveraging gamification and CEP technology provides strategy experts with the ability to graphically define gamification strategies, which can be directly transformed into code executable by event-based systems. Therefore, this is a novel solution for bringing CEP closer to any strategy expert, positively influencing the gamification strategy design, implementation and real-time monitoring processes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.";"09505849";12;"Spain";"Scopus; Web of Science"

One of the approaches to this type of innovation consists of using the platforms where MOOCs are hosted for the development of courses that are aligned to their on-campus curricular contents. They are known as Small Private Online Courses (SPOCs), which allow online access to knowledge for groups of students with a well-defined profile. The platforms where MOOCs (and SPOCs) are hosted have been designed to support large volumes of data and visits. However, these platforms present important limitations regarding the implementation of collaborative learning activities. To address this problem, this article presents MyMOOCSpace, a cloud-based mobile system aimed at supporting effective collaboration in MOOCs, by combining key aspects of collaboration from the research area of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) with game-based dynamics. MyMOOCSpace has been tested in three quasi-experiments that were run in four Latin-American universities with a total of 68 participants. The objective was to assess its usability and its effect in enhancing collaboration among students in a SPOC. The results obtained on usability show that MyMOOCSpace is easy to use, and that participants felt pleased with while using it.

In order to make sense of the contradictory findings regarding the effectiveness of implementing game design elements in an online learning environment, this paper complements the available body of research by addressing three holes. We have (1) analysed gamification's underlying motivational processes from a Self-Determination Theory-perspective, thereby accounting for the motivational effects of various game design implementations; (2) empirically assessed subtle motivational changes over time, and (3) accounted for the potential individual differences in motivational effects of gamification. Over a period of 15 weeks, we administered four surveys to measure the possible evolution in students’ (N = 40) motivational levels in response to interacting with need-supporting game elements that were implemented in Google + Communities used in a university course. Participants’ autonomous and controlled motivation was curve linear, showing an initial downward trend that surprisingly shifted to an upward tendency towards the end of the semester. Their controlled motivation stayed stable throughout. The results illustrated the significance of the individual nature of motivational processes, the importance of sensitive longitudinal motivation measurements, and the relevance of the implemented game elements’ design characteristics.

Design: Prospective, single-blinded, pilot, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Large university teaching hospital. Participants: Participants were anesthesiology residents on their cardiac anesthesiology rotation. Interventions: EchoEducator, a TEE image–based smartphone application of learning content through questions, was developed. Content was derived from the Examination of Special Competence in Basic Perioperative Transesophageal Echocardiography and the Objective Structured Clinical Examination portion of the APPLIED Examination and focused on identification of basic TEE views, cardiac structures, and pathology. Residents were randomly assigned to receive access to either the application or to standard intraoperative teaching. Thirty residents met inclusion criteria, and 18 residents completed the study. A pre-intervention assessment was given at the beginning of the rotation, and a post-intervention assessment was given after 2 weeks. Measurements: The primary outcome was the difference between the post-test score and the pre-test score. Standard bivariate statistics and the chi-square test were used for categorical variables, and the Student t test was used for continuous variables.

Once play is positioned as a state of mind, activities that constitute work need not be disjunct from playful behavior. Yet for most workers, work is rarely if ever playful, and attempts to import play behavior into the workplace (‘gamification’) do not result in greater playfulness. Part of this problem results from specific aesthetic values for games having dominated both work and play. As Roger Caillois warned half a century ago, sport-like values have increasingly saturated the culture of the overdeveloped world. Meanwhile, gamification processes have only been able to export task-focussed reward structures from the domain of play–practices that descend from Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but that have been denuded of their playful qualities. In parallel to the gamification of work has been the gamification of games, namely an increasing emphasis on tasks to structure video game play (e.g., achievements), and thus make them more compelling yet less playful. In so much as this entails forcing particular patterns of understanding onto both players and workers, this makes gamification a parallel to Jacques Rancière's stultification in education: a binding of wills instead of an emancipation. If we want a world where work could be more playful, we must begin by breaking the cultural dominance of sport-like and task-like aesthetics of play, and endeavour to overcome the underlying fears that prevent work from being played. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.";"1369118X";4;"United Kingdom";"Scopus; Web of Science"

For uncommon events in medicine, such as pediatric CPR, more frequent training is associated with improved performance among healthcare providers and physicians in training. Gamified learning may facilitate motivation to practice CPR, though studies to support this are lacking. Intervention. Residents were interviewed to understand motivating factors for CPR practice outside of a traditional classroom certification setting. Methods. We used a qualitative study design within a larger multinational study. Semi-structured, one-on-one interviews were completed with pediatric residents using a constructivist approach. Transcripts were reviewed independently by two authors (IHG, JLS). Results. The inductive framework gradually moved away from gamification and towards that of self-determination. Participating residents reported several types of intrinsic and extrinsic motivational drivers towards practicing CPR, such as practicing CPR to prepare, or as a connection to clinical practice. Some themes were amotivational, such as performance anxiety, and detracted from their drive to practice. Despite a gamification design to this curriculum, these components were rarely mentioned. These themes related to achieving Maslow’s three psychological needs of autonomy, relatedness and competence. Conclusion. The motivation to practice CPR among residents aligns with the self-determination theory. By stimulating intrinsic motivating factors, future curriculum design may better motivate residents to practice CPR. © The Author(s) 2020.";"10468781";2;"United States";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the implementation of a mental gamification from blended learning based on the flex model and efficacy of this program on students. METHODS: In this study, with the design of mental illness lessons for undergraduate and executive groups, using flex model, two parts of technical and educational design were used. In the technical section, three parts on dynamics, mechanisms, and elements of gaming were considered. Intervention was studied on different groups of medical students including medical, health, and laboratory sciences. Effect of this educational program and its impact on their students' learning, motivation, and satisfaction was studied using quantitative and qualitative analyses. RESULTS: The results of the students' prospective about the efficacy of the method showed that the mean scores of most of the items were higher than the average. This implies that students' attitude toward using gamification was positive. In the other part, the qualitative results of the study were analyzed and the students' analysis of their advantages and disadvantages and their perceptions on the impact of the intervention was examined. CONCLUSION: Based on the flex model, mental gamification based on blended learning is effective in shaping the students' satisfaction. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

As a key risk mitigation policy, organisations are investing in professional training courses for their employees to raise awareness on cyber attacks and related defences. Serious games have emerged as a new approach that can complement instruction-led or computer-based security training by providing a fun environment where players learn and practice cyber security concepts through the game. In this paper we propose Riskio, a tabletop game to increase cyber security awareness for people with no-technical background working in organisations. Riskio provides an active learning environment where players build knowledge on cyber security attacks and defences by playing both the role of the attacker and the defender of critical assets in a fictitious organisation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd";"01674048";9;"United Kingdom";"Scopus; Web of Science"

However, little is known about how different students experience and are engaged by it. We present a long-term study which identified distinct behavioral and performance patterns in participants taking a gamified college course. Our study lasted for three years, during which we deployed three consecutive instances of the course, each featuring improvements based on student feedback from the previous instances. To understand how different students behaved in our gamified experience, according to their daily performance, we performed cluster analysis and assessed student engagement in the last year using a formal instrument. We then did a cluster-wise analysis using different performance and behavioral measures, to further assess and characterize every cluster. To wit, we identified six different student clusters, each featuring different behaviors and performance levels. However, only four were present in the last year, which differed in terms of engagement with the course.

Most research in this field has been conducted in more economically advanced and developed regions, and there is a paucity of research in emerging country contexts. It is argued that gamification can be effectively utilised in these contexts to address learner engagement and motivation. The study investigated the extent to which six determined predictors (perceptions about playfulness, curriculum fit, learning opportunities, challenge, self-efficacy and computer anxiety) influence the advocacy to accept a gamified application by South African tourism teachers. Tourism education was selected for empirical study because of its popularity in developing countries and where the economy heavily depends on the sector. However, it is a highly under researched area. Data was obtained from 209 tourism teachers, and was tested against the research model using a structural equation modelling approach. Findings reveal that the constructs of perceived playfulness, curriculum fit have a positive, direct impact on the construct of behavioural intention. The exogenous constructs of challenge, learning opportunities, self-efficacy and computer anxiety have an indirect effect on behavioural intention via perceived playfulness or curriculum fit.

Then, a scale initially including 26 items was developed based on the observation results and related literature. The quantitative data were gathered using this scale and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was applied to examine the factor structure of the scale. The observation results were categorised under the following six themes: learning effect, expected outcome, competition, entertainment, engagement and intention. After required EFAs were implemented, three items were removed; thus, the final scale consisted of 23 items, and six factors that affect the gamification process in undergraduate education were revealed.

Summary: Use of digital games that include elements of gamification or consist of standalone videogames or virtual-reality-based games, represent a promising intervention strategy to address the HIV prevention and care continuum, especially among youth. Our review demonstrates that there is significant room for growth in this area in designing, developing, testing and most importantly, implementation and dissemination these novel interventions.

Educational researchers and practitioners both struggle with identifying when, where, and how to use gamification design concepts. The present study provides findings from a meta-analysis that integrated the empirical, quantitative research on gamification in formal educational settings on student learning outcomes. This was achieved by examining the overall effect size, identifying which gamification design elements (e.g., badges) were used, and determining under what circumstances (e.g., engineering education) gamification works. The final corpus of data included 30 independent studies and associated effect sizes comparing gamification to non-gamification conditions while accounting for N = 3083 participants. The overall effect size using a random-effects model is g =.464 [.244 to.684] in favor of the gamification condition, which is a small to medium effect size. We examined 14 different gamification design elements (e.g., leaderboards) and showed that each leads to different effects on student learning outcomes. Further, the type of publication (e.g., journal article), student classification (e.g., undergraduate), and subject area (e.g., mathematics) are also investigated as moderators.

Gamification use is often suggested for difficult activities because it enhances users' engagement and motivation level. Due to such benefits, the use of gamification is also proposed in education environments to improve students' performance, engagement, and satisfaction. Computer science in higher education is a tough area of study and thus needs to utilize various already explored benefits of gamification. This research develops an empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in teaching computer science in higher education. Along with the learning outcomes, the effect of group size on students' satisfaction level is also measured. Furthermore, the impact of gamification over time is analyzed throughout a semester to observe its effectiveness as a long-term learning technique. The analysis, covering both learning outcome and students' satisfaction, suggests that gamification is an effective tool to teach tough courses at higher education level; however, group size should be taken into account for optimal classroom size and better learning experience. © 2020 ACM.";"19466226";3;"Pakistan";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Based on the use of game mechanics, gamification aims at engaging students in their learning. However, there is not much research on the use of gamification in school settings, especially when it comes to foreign language learning; hence, we know little about to what extent this aim is actually fulfilled. This study intends to contribute to filling this research gap. Silva’s four dimensions of play–built from Henriot’s theory of play–are used as an analytical framework to study a teaching situation where a gamified application, developed for this research project, was introduced in a French-as-a-foreign-language class in a Norwegian upper secondary school. This article focuses on the students’ engagement in their learning activities and their control over the tasks. The interaction analysis of video data reveals that students are indeed showing expressions of playfulness and autonomy. The analysis also shows that the students are engaged in the activity and are voluntarily completing additional language tasks. These findings are promising for the use of gamified resources in foreign language learning classes. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.";"17501229";4;"Norway";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Gamification refers to designing information systems to afford similar experiences and motivations as games do, and consequently, attempting to affect user behavior. In recent years, popularity of gamification has skyrocketed and manifested in growing numbers of gamified applications, as well as a rapidly increasing amount of research. However, this vein of research has mainly advanced without an agenda, theoretical guidance or a clear picture of the field. To make the picture more coherent, we provide a comprehensive review of the gamification research (N = 819 studies) and analyze the research models and results in empirical studies on gamification. While the results in general lean towards positive findings about the effectiveness of gamification, the amount of mixed results is remarkable. Furthermore, education, health and crowdsourcing as well as points, badges and leaderboards persist as the most common contexts and ways of implementing gamification. Concurrently, gamification research still lacks coherence in research models, and a consistency in the variables and theoretical foundations. As a final contribution of the review, we provide a comprehensive discussion, consisting of 15 future research trajectories, on future agenda for the growing vein of literature on gamification and gameful systems within the information system science field. © 2018 The Authors";"02684012";207;"Finland";"Scopus; Web of Science"

In this sense, the Bi-National Laboratory on Smart Sustainable Energy Management and Technology Training between Mexico and the United States of America was launched with the purpose of trying MOOC technology and measuring its impact on the academic, business, and social sectors. Under this scenario, this study aimed to show the relationship between using gamification and level of performance in a MOOC on energy topics. The methodology was quantitative, using the course analytical data for socio-demographic information and predictive models. A total of 6246 participants enrolled in the MOOC and 1060 finished it. The results showed that participants aged between 20 and 50 had the highest completion rates in the gamified challenge; the higher academic degree, the more inclined participants were to solve the gamified challenge; and no such distinction exists by gender.

Such applications are widely used for the purposes of bringing a gamification in the education industry nowadays. The primary purpose of this research is to determine the opinions of teachers who are active in the education industry and their experience in using ‘Kahoot’ as a teaching aid in bringing the diversification in the industry. In this study, a semi-structured interview form was used as a data collection tool. Opinions of prospective teachers participating in the study was taken into consideration to form an end conclusion of this research study. The research data also involves a semi-structured student opinion form, and a procedure of content analysis was undertaken in the analysis of the data. The study group of the research consists of 38 teacher candidates studying in Kazan (Volga region) Federal University, Institute of Legislation and Comparative Law under the Government of the Russian Federation, Plekhanov Russian University of Economics and Sechenov University. As a result of the study performed over the set of teachers and students, it was concluded that the ‘Kahoot’ program is widely beneficial for students and teachers. It was also concluded that the Kahoot program is helpful in eliminating the deficiencies in learning. However, one of the shortcomings of the ‘Kahoot’ program is that it is an internet-based programme. Hence it may be problematic for some of the students to use the programme who have less knowledge in the internet domain. At the end of the study, a positive set of opinions about the Kahoot program was suggested, which majorly revolved around the idea that the programme is not internet based. © 2020.

In a between-subjects experimental field study, students were randomly assigned to three different conditions (no badges, badges visible to peers, badges only visible to students themselves). The results show that badges have less impact on motivation and performance than is commonly assumed. Independent of condition, students’ intrinsic motivation decreased over time. Contrary to expectation, the badges that could only be viewed by the students themselves were evaluated more positively than those that could also be viewed by others. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd";"03601315";55;"Germany";"Scopus; Web of Science"

The use of reward-based gamification strategies is one approach to promote student engagement and prevent dropout. However, there is a lack of solid empirical studies analyzing the effects of rewards in MOOC environments. This paper reports a between-subjects design study conducted in a MOOC to analyze the effects of badges and redeemable rewards on student retention and engagement. Results show that the implemented reward strategies had not significant effect on student retention and behavioral engagement measured through the number of pageviews, task submissions, and student activity time. However, it was found that learners able to earn badges and redeemable rewards participated more in gamified tasks than those learners in the control group. Additionally, results reveal that the participants in the redeemable reward condition requested and earned earlier the rewards than those participants in the badge condition.

The development of this design framework started as a response to complex changes in society and education (e.g. high turnover rate of knowledge, changing labour market), which require a more creative response of learners to the world problems that surround them. Many of these challenges are related to science and it would be expected that students are attracted to science, however the contrary is the case. One of the origins of this disinterest can be found in the way science is taught. Therefore, after reviewing the relevant literature we propose the SLAM framework as a tool to aid the design of science courses with high motivational impact on students. The framework is concerned with the assumption that science learning activities should be applicable and relevant to contemporary life and transferable to ‘real-world’ situations. The design framework proposes three design dimensions: context, technology and pedagogy, and aims at integrating learning in formal and informal contexts through blended learning scenarios by using today’s flexible, interactive and immersive technologies (e.g. mobile, augmented reality, virtual reality). © 2016 The Open University.";"02680513";19;"Portugal";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Gamification is a technique used to increase student motivation and engagement in small-scale educational contexts. However, the effects of gamification on student engagement have been scarcely explored in MOOC environments, and the findings so far are inconsistent. To address this gap, this research work examines the students’ behavior toward earning badges and how it relates to their engagement in a gamified MOOC. According to the results, the behaviors toward badges of the active students were generally positive and significantly correlated with other variables measuring their engagement (e.g., pageviews, submitted tasks, forum posts), although this positive behavior seems to decrease throughout the course. Additionally, students that reported high motivation by badges at the end of the course showed a higher engagement level than those that were not appealed by badges. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.";"16155289";12;"Spain";"Scopus; Web of Science"

More specifically, the aim was to empirically explore and develop knowledge about the process of designing for gamification teaching in K-12 education, to develop gamification teaching design principles and, in addition, to study how emergent technologies could be used in this context. Four sub-studies were conducted between 2014 and 2018 which included four groups of university students as co-creators in the teaching designs. The empirical material is based on observations from the field test in which school students tested university student designs. Post interviews were conducted with participating school teachers and university students. In addition, university student written reports were included. Findings illustrate four themes; 1) The design process of the gamification teaching activities, 2) The gamification teaching design principles developed, 3) The school students' experiences of the gamification designs and 4) Designing gamification teaching activities - a complex process. Findings show that designing for gamification teaching designs using emergent technologies is quite a complex process. This complexity concerns, among other things, the puzzle of combining the different knowledge domains into the TPACK Model (i.e. technological knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, content knowledge) in an emergent teaching practice (gamification) with the use of emergent technologies. The co-creation process and the move between these knowledge domain areas could maximize the effect of achieving a pedagogical balance concerning what school students perceive as fun without sacrificing focus on their knowledge acquisition and learning processes. © 2019.

This article aims at gaining an in-depth understanding of the power of gamification as shaping motivation based on the principles of basic psychological need satisfaction derived from Self-Determination Theory. This study is based on the qualitative analysis of 125 surveys (n = 40) and 2 focus group interviews (n = 7) gained throughout a 15-week university master course in which students voluntary interacted with a gamified platform. The results show the ambivalent motivational power of game elements in technology-supported learning environments—affording feelings of autonomy, competence and relatedness in some cases, thwarting them in others—with situational factors playing an important role in this process. These findings aid in understanding the workings of gamification and might help in explaining the mixed results about the effectiveness of gamification reported in previous literature.

The purpose of this one-group, pretest, posttest experimental study was to determine if a game could be used as an adjunct teaching method to improve students’ understanding of connections between imaging findings and differential diagnoses. A novel board game focusing on differential diagnoses in thoracic radiography was developed. One hundred fourth-year veterinary students took a brief pretest, played the board game, and took a brief posttest as a part of their respective clinical radiology rotations. Pretest results were compared to posttest results using a paired t-test to determine if playing the game impacted student understanding. Students’ mean scores on the posttest were significantly higher than mean pretest scores (P < 0.0001). Thus, results indicate that playing the board game resulted in improved short-term understanding of thoracic differential diagnoses by fourth-year students, and use of the board game on a clinical rotation seems to be a beneficial part of the learning process. © 2016 American College of Veterinary Radiology";"10588183";3;"United States";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Methods: Two first-year classes of dental undergraduate students were recruited for the study which extended over 4 months and ended in January 2015. A pre-intervention assessment of students’ academic writing skills was performed using criteria to evaluate writing. The same criteria were used to evaluate the final writing assignment after the intervention. Students’ satisfaction with game aspects was assessed. The per cent change in writing score was regressed on scores of satisfaction with game aspects controlling for gender. Perceived improvement in writing was also assessed. Results: Data from 87 (94.6%) students were available for analysis. Students’ overall satisfaction with the gamified experience was modest [mean (SD) = 5.9 (2.1)] and so was their overall perception of improvement in writing [mean (SD) = 6.0 (2.2)]. The per cent score of the first assignment was 35.6 which improved to 80 in the last assignment. Satisfaction with playing the game was significantly associated with higher percentage of improvement in actual writing skills [regression coefficient (95% confidence interval) = 21.1 (1.9, 40.2)].

Innovations in basic science teaching methods are needed to keep up with an ever-changing landscape of technology. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether students in a medical and dental histology course would have better grades if they used gaming software Kahoot® and whether gamification effects on learning and enjoyment. Methods: In an effort to both evoke students' interest and expand their skill retention, an online competition using Kahoot® was implemented for first-year students in 2018 (n = 215) at the University of Eastern Finland. Additionally, closed (160/215) or open-ended (41/215) feedback questions were collected and analyzed. Results: The Kahoot® gamification program was successful and resulted in learning gains. The overall participant satisfaction using Kahoot® was high, with students (124/160) indicating that gamification increased their motivation to learn. The gaming approach seemed to enable the students to overcome individual difficulties (139/160) and to set up collaboration (107/160); furthermore, gamification promoted interest (109/160), and the respondents found the immediate feedback from senior professionals to be positive (146/160). In the open-ended survey, the students (23/41) viewed collaborative team- and gamification-based learning positively.

This is because it allows the expression of several problems related to digital design, artificial intelligence, databases, compilers, and formal languages, among others, as a sequence of Boolean operations and variables, which can be dealt with by using Boolean algebra methods to optimize algorithms, minimize digital components, and so forth. This study presents a piece of web-based software, denominated as MiniBool, which has been developed with the objective of supporting the learning of Boolean algebra in a blended learning setting. This educational proposal gives students the opportunity to reinforce learning at any time and in any place. It additionally increases the learners’ motivation by including gamification, through the use of a ranking that shows the students’ level of participation. MiniBool was evaluated by means of a formal experiment, which was carried out with Discrete Mathematics students at a higher education institution in Mexico, where two groups were formed randomly: A control group, whose members attended classes and reinforced their knowledge in a traditional manner with a pencil and paper, and an experimental group, which learned in a blended learning context, receiving the same classes as the control group, but reinforcing what they had learned using MiniBool. The statistical results obtained indicate that the use of MiniBool has a positive and motivating effect on learning and that a greater academic performance is achieved than when the traditional teaching-learning method is applied. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC";"10613773";1;"Spain";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Although cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills are lifesaving skills, the gap between awareness and actual training remains significant. Advances in technology are shaping the future of education and innovative learning solutions are essential to facilitate effective and accessible training. This project objective is to develop a self-directed educational system for hands-on CPR training using virtual reality (VR) technology. Methods. HTC VIVE was the chosen VR engine, and Unity3D was the software used for development. CPR skills including chest compressions, rescue breathing, and automated external defibrillator (AED) are taught in VR through focused instructions, demonstrations, and simulated interactive scenarios with hands-on training sessions. A tracking system was designed using virtual planes and VIVE-Tracker for accurate measurements of chest compressions (rate, depth, and recoil), hands’ position and AED. A real mannequin was integrated in the VR space and overlaid with virtual 3D-human model for realistic haptic feedback and hands-on training. VIVE-controller was used for precise calibration between the mannequin location in real environment and the virtual human model in VR space. Results. The VR-CPR prototype was designed to be generic, approachable, and easy to follow. Realism and interaction were achieved through 3D virtual scenes simulating common sites at which cardiac arrest may occur. Variety in scenarios and gamification features like scoring and difficulty levels of training were made to enhance users’ engagement. The VR-mannequin hybrid system enabled quality training and immersive learning experience. Further, real-time feedback and scoring system are built for self-directed learning and optimal performance. Conclusions. The developed VR-hybrid product is a structured educational tool for hands-on CPR training and ongoing practice. This innovative technology provides self-directed learning with no restrictions of time, place, or personnel, which are the main challenges with current traditional courses. This product is a promising CPR training initiative in the evolution of digital education. © The Author(s) 2019.";"10468781";7;"Denmark";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Data sources PubMed (including MEDLINE), CINAHL, Science Direct (including EMBASE), BioMed Central, ACM digital, Emerald Insight, Google Scholar and Research Gate. Methods Studies that were published between 1 January 2002 and 31 May 2018 in English were included if the participants were adults, with at least one long-term condition, were able to self-administer their medication and were treated in primary care settings. The quality of evidence was assessed with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system and the risk of bias was appraised using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results From a total of 27 studies that matched the inclusion criteria, 12 were excluded due to low quality of evidence, 10 were rated moderate and 5 were rated high quality. All the included studies had low sample size and limited follow-up duration. Thirteen of the included studies found that the use of a PHR has increased medication adherence. The identified design features are reminders, education, personalisation and tailoring, feedback and alerts, gamification, medication management, medical appointment management, diary and self-monitoring, health condition management, set goals, patient's blog and tethered. It was impossible to draw conclusions as to which feature is important to what group of patients and why. The most frequently identified conditions were HIV and diabetes. This review did not identify any papers with negative results. It was not possible to numerically aggregate the PHR effect due to high heterogeneity of the medication adherence measurement, study type, participants and PHRs used. Conclusion Although we found recurrent evidence that PHRs can improve medication adherence, there is little evidence to date to indicate which design features facilitate this process. © 2019 Author(s).";"20446055";5;"United Kingdom";"Scopus; Web of Science"

Based on continued research, however, the badge began to be recognized as a scale to measure the learner's knowledge and skill and an important means of helping learners to gradually build intrinsic motivation by using certain extrinsic motivators. As the badge's value has grown, the importance of its design has garnered attention. Objective: The objective of this research was to establish a badge design framework that can be used in a gamified learning environment. Methods: Data were collected from previous studies on badge design, 943 badge cases were extracted from 11 online and offline gamification in education contents, and their patterns and features were analyzed. Results: Based on the analysis of results from previous studies and 943 collected badge cases, our study suggests three conditions for badge design. Through the literature review and collected badge cases, our study designed a badge design framework. First, it is necessary to distinguish whether the type of learning activity required for earning badges is physical or conceptual. Second, it is necessary to distinguish whether the scale of an activity required for earning badges requires individual learning or interaction-induced learning. Third, it is important to review whether the time and effort invested in earning badges is simple, repetitive, and short-term or continuous and long-term. Based on these three conditions, collected badge cases were analyzed. To verify self-developed badge types, we conducted a chi-square test on the collected cases and confirmed that there was a significant difference for each of the eight badge types (Pearson chi-square 1117.7, P<.001). Conclusions: Through its literature review on previous studies, this study demonstrated the badge's educational effectiveness. The badge design framework suggested in our study is expected to resolve some of the difficulties experienced during the badge design process in a gamified learning environment, encourage efficient badge design, and maximize learning effect. © JMIR Serious Games.All right reserved.";"22919279";2;"South Korea";"Scopus"

The duration of the study lasted an entire school year. The central theories underpinning flipped learning with gamification design were based on the first principles of Instruction and self-determination theory. A mixed methods approach was used with quantitative (i.e., tests and an optional assignment) and qualitative (i.e., student interviews) methods applied. The test results indicate that students in the flipped class (n = 28) significantly outperformed those in the traditional (n = 27) and online independent study (n = 21) classes. In addition, flipped learning with gamification promoted students’ cognitive engagement better than the other two approaches. The findings of student interviews suggest that peer interactions inside the flipped classroom were critical to promoting students’ mathematics achievement and cognitive engagement, as opposed to online learning resources and gamification per se.

Gamification offers a great potential to promote and support the learning process by providing attractive, motivating and effective learning tools in order to achieve specific educational goals. So far studies have been conducted in various fields including sciences, mathematics, business and language, to examine the effectiveness of gamification in improving students’ performance. Nevertheless, little attention has been given in accounting education to the potential of gamification to enhance students’ performance when it is employed in the classroom. Learning accounting can be very tough and challenging for students especially when the subject is taught in a conventional way. To help students in understanding the underlying concepts of accounting and remembering the format of financial statements, the authors have proposed an accounting game, called “Accounting on the Block” (AOTB). This paper is aimed at demonstrating the effect of gamification approach of accounting teaching and learning on students’ performance as opposed to conventional approach. AOTB games were experimented in two accounting courses, Financial Accounting 2 (FAR160) and Financial and Management Accounting (ACC466) offered at one of the Higher Learning Institutions in Pahang during two academic sessions. The participants consisted of 32 students from FAR160 course and 54 students from ACC466 course. For each course, students were split into two groups: One group was taught with conventional lectures (control group) and the other group was taught using AOTB games (experimental group). The pre- and post-tests were conducted and recorded for both groups. The results of this study show that students who were exposed to the gamification performed better than the students who were taught via a conventional method. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

Ideation is often identified as a key component of the ''fuzzy front end'', and recognized as one of the highest leverage points for a firm. Today's democratizing innovation has led to a situation that the best ideas for new products and services no longer originate only from companies' staff. Instead, they come from almost anywhere and anyone. By opening up the ideation phase in the digital era, companies actually open their doors to external experts and solution-providers, searching for new partners and new technologies to incorporate into their existing products and services.

More so, the purpose of the study aims to use the GT through LS in teaching probability courses to Senior High School (SHS) students. Specifically, the paper aims to document the use of GT in teaching simple and compound probability of events and to develop integrative gamification using manipulatives in teaching probability. A qualitative case study was adopted in which a team was created to conduct an LS. Results revealed that the use of gamification was perceived to be effective in teaching probability to SHS students. Also, manipulatives were utilized in which students’ performances were graded based on the rules in each activity and according to the scoring rubric. Notwithstanding, the use of manipulative in each activity was effective in engaging learners in the teaching-learning process and in gaining an understanding of probability. Surprisingly, the use of probing questions was then recommended by the experts in the LS since they saw a more meaningful discussion in it. It was recommended to integrate the lesson to real-life experiences of the students aside from using typical examples found in the book. A positive note highlighted is its ability to foster cooperation and care for others among students. Notable observations can be linked to the qualities of the teacher in the effective facilitation of gamification. Now, what makes the LS essential is that it teaches the entire educators to be keen on emphasizing the objectives after implementing game-based activities that it is not about winning or gaining points but learning to cooperate and helping one another. © 2020, IJSTR.";"22778616";NA;"Philippines";"Scopus"

It has been defined as the use of gaming elements and mechanics in nongaming environments. While having multiple uses in commercial, military and medical sectors, gamification is using techniques similar to those in games to motivate and engage actions and behaviors. This paper takes a deeper look at techniques suitable for education and e-learning, and comes out with a model that describes the design of educational gamification. The application of gamification in e-learning has been done by following the framework proposed in this paper. This framework combines gamification processes and ordinary e-learning processes in one model called “Gamified e-learning design model” (GED). The ultimate goal of this paper is to expound and demonstrate through empirical means that applying the (GED) model when building elearning platform can improve the students’ participation, performance, and motivation, and thus it promotes learning. The result of the experiment is the demonstration that gamification can promote, engage and enhance learning. It has been proved by gathering data using questionnaires and by examining selected group of students that have experienced the gamified system used in testing. Although most of the results were positive, there is still a need for further research and testing for gamification use in learning applications. There is also a need for testing in bigger environment, involving larger amount of participants. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.";"18286003";11;"Jordan";"Scopus"

It can be used as a web-based education tool to increase student engagement and motivation. According to United Nations, in addition to our past research with hundreds of Arab deaf people over ten years, we reached the conclusion that most deaf people are undereducated or semi-literate. This is due to poor ways of communication with society and lack of means that support lifelong learning. Parity in life and self-learning systems are rights to everyone regardless of their ability. From this point, the aim of this project is to develop an e-learning system for teaching a difficult subject, such mathematics, to the Arab deaf students. A gamification technique will be followed and different gamification components will be included through the process of system development to motivate the deaf students. This framework is supported with an Arabic Sign Language (ArSL) acting avatar to support more clarity, interactivity, and integration for the deaf learners. Therefore, the proposed framework will fulfill the psychological satisfaction needs of the intended users. © Common Ground Research Networks.";"18359795";1;"Egypt";"Scopus"

Nevertheless, the quality of the results in PA depends on good evaluations of reviewers. Thus, the main drawback for scaling up the use of PA is the presence of inadequate behaviours, such as being too harsh or too soft in the assessment, or even not offering a helpful feedback. This usually occurs due to the lack of motivation and engagement of students in the PA process. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a gamified peer assessment model, where gamification elements are used to engage students in PA activities. Two experiments using the proposed model within an intelligent tutoring system called MeuTutor shows satisfactory outcomes. We verified that the average grade given by students to an essay are equivalent to those given by experts, but the time and costs to complete the assessments were largely reduced. Furthermore, the use of gamification helped to increase the amount of students' access to the system in 64.28%; increase in 10.53% the number of essays written and submitted; and improve the quantity and quality of assessments for each essay. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd";"07475632";26;"Brazil";"Scopus"

Many studies show improvements with respect to traditional methodologies. Several educational strategies have also been combined with Gamification with interesting results. Interest is growing and evidence suggest Gamification has a promising future. However, there is a barrier preventing many researchers from properly understanding Gamification principles. Gamification focuses of engaging trainees in learning with same intensity that games engage players on playing. But only some very well designed games achieve this level of engagement. Designing truly entertaining games is a difficult task with a great artistic component. Although some studies have tried to clarify how Game Design produces fun, there is no scientific consensus. Well established knowledge on Game Design resides in sets of rules of thumb and good practices, based on empirical experience. Game industry professionals acquire this experience through practice. Most educators and researchers often overlook the need for such experience to successfully design Gamification. And so, many research papers focus on single game-elements like points, present non-gaming activities like questionnaires, design non-engaging activities or fail to comprehend the underlying principles on why their designs do not yield expected results. This work presents a rubric for educators and researchers to start working in Gamification without previous experience in Game Design. This rubric decomposes the continuous space of Game Design into a set of ten discrete characteristics. It is aimed at diminishing the entry barrier and helping to acquire initial experience with Game Design fundamentals. The main proposed uses are twofold: To analyse existing games or gamified activities gaining a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses and to help in the design or improvement of activities. Focus is on Game Design characteristics rather than game elements, similarly to professional game designers. The goal is to help gaining experience towards designing successful Gamification environments. Presented rubric is based on our previous design experience, compared and contrasted with literature, and empirically tested with some example games and gamified activities. © 2019 by the authors.";"22279709";8;"Spain";"Scopus"

Besides their many advantages, smartphones might pave the way to compulsive usage and addictive experiences. To remedy this problem, this study proposes an authentic approach which integrates consumer behavior theories and techniques such as unhook and gamification. An education program has been designed based on these approaches to decrease the problematic smartphone use. Method: The participants of the education program consisted of 305 students (48.2% girls and 51.8% boys) with a mean age of 14.57 (SD = 0.74). The Demographic Form and Smartphone Addiction Scale for Adolescents (SASA) were conducted before the education program and three weeks after the education. Results: The results of the paired sample t-test analysis before and after the education program revealed that the SASA total scores decreased significantly (p < 0.01). There are significant differences in terms of gender, mothers’ education and class levels. Conclusion: This research emphasizes the role of an interdisciplinary approach to the addiction problem. The content used in the education program includes strategies that originally aimed at increasing consumption. The effectiveness of the program can be enhanced further in the future along with self-regulatory additions. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.";"16617827";6;"Turkey";"Scopus"

Serious games have advantages in the dissemination of reliable information during the pandemic; they can provide qualified content while offering interactivity to the user, and they have great reach over the internet. Objective: This study aimed to develop a serious game with the purpose of providing science-based information on the prevention of COVID-19 and personal care during the pandemic while assessing players’ knowledge about COVID-19–related topics. Methods: The study was conducted with the interdisciplinary collaboration of specialists in health sciences, computing, and design at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The health recommendations were grouped into six thematic blocks, presented in a quiz format. The software languages were based on the progressive web app development methodology with the Ionic framework, JavaScript, HTML5, cascading style sheets, and TypeScript (Angular). Open data reports of how users interact with the serious game were obtained using the Google Analytics application programming interface. The visual identity, logo, infographics, and icons were carefully developed by considering a selection of colors, typography, sounds, and images that are suitable for young audiences. Cards with cartoon characters were introduced at the end of each thematic topic to interact with the player, reinforcing their correct answers or alerting them to the need to learn more about the disease. The players’ performance was assessed by the rate of incorrect and correct answers and analyzed by linear correlation coefficient over 7 weeks. The agile SCRUM development methodology enabled quick and daily interactions of developers through a webchat and sequential team meetings. Results: The game “COVID-19–Did You Know?” was made available for free on a public university website on April 1, 2020. The game had been accessed 17,571 times as of September 2020. Dissemination actions such as reports on social media and television showed a temporal correspondence with the access number. The players’ error rate in the topic “Mask” showed a negative trend (r=–.83; P=.01) over the weeks of follow-up. The other topics showed no significant trend over the weeks. Conclusions: The gamification strategy for health education content on the theme of COVID-19 reached a young audience, which is considered to be a priority in the strategy of orientation toward social distancing. Specific educational reinforcement measures were proposed and implemented based on the players’ performance. The improvement in the users’ performance on the topic about the use of masks may reflect an increase in information about or adherence to mask use over time. © Juliano De Souza Gaspar, Eura Martins Lage, Fernando José Da Silva, Érico Mineiro, Isaias José Ramos De Oliveira, Igor Oliveira, Rayner Guilherme De Souza, Juan Rodrigues Oliveira Gusmão, Camila Fernanda Donadoni De Souza, Zilma Silveira Nogueira Reis.";"22919279";1;"Brazil";"Scopus"

Nine third-through sixth-grade classrooms (n = 292 students) in one elementary-middle school in Detroit, Michigan (49% female, 95% nonwhite; 80% qualified for free/reduced lunch) participated in this 20-week intervention where teachers implemented 5 × 4 min moderate-to-vigorous activity breaks per day. Gamification of activity breaks occurred during weeks 13–20 of the intervention and included the use of game design elements and classroom goals for activity break intensity. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during activity breaks was measured via direct observation. There was a significant effect of intervention with a 27% increase in student MVPA participation during the gamified intervention weeks compared with the standard intervention weeks (p = 0.03). Gamification of activity breaks resulted in 55% (compared with 25% during the standard intervention) of students accumulating approximately 20 min of health-enhancing physical activity per day in their classroom.

This study explores promoting motivation in a distance education, third-year computer programming course via a gamified approach to improve coursework participation and student experience. Motivation was examined from a Self-Determination Theory (SDT) perspective, as gamified approaches often rely on external motivation and the explicit use of competition to engender internal motivation leading to desired behaviours. The results of using gamification in education are mixed, and its use is controversial. Two cycles of action research on the introduction of eight playful elements are reported on, and data relating to student engagement with the course and a student questionnaire was gathered. There was little evidence that the intervention led to behaviour change or improved scores; however, students responded very positively to the intervention, although some negative themes emerged. The extent to which the playful approach supported the basic psychological needs of SDT is discussed and the intervention's results critically considered, including whether the effort involved in such an approach was worth it. It was concluded that such playful approaches might have positive motivational effects. © 2018 Athabasca University.";"14923831";6;"South Africa";"Scopus"

Despite having a dearth of comparable qualitative research found to date that may be compared to this particular research, it is felt that data gleaned from this Big Data study may be extrapolated to the general student populace. Over a full year study, Monday through Friday on 48 elementary learners of English, NVivo 11 Pro was utilized to wade through the copious amount of information ranging from field notes, interviews, discussions, and transcripts of recorded classroom interactions. Data culled offered results to demonstrate that 87% of students' initial responses showed gaming to be their most preferred activity in English classes; however, subsequent investigations from themes and succeeding interviews facilitated data to show that unanimous agreement within the student body favored games the most for learning/language usage. The caveat in choosing games as the primary choice is that certain types of games or prerequisites be enacted; such as through, proper leveling, stimulation, competition, and/or cooperative work. Therefore, upon implementing the eight conditions of optimal language learning a post-methods curriculum in the gamification of English language acquisition was acquired and accepted by student and teacher alike. © 2017 International Information Institute.";"13434500";1;"South Korea";"Scopus"

It comprises a collection of exercises including recent service robot applications in real life, with different robots such as autonomous cars, drones or vacuum cleaners. It uses Robot Operating System (ROS) middleware, the de facto standard in robot programming, the 3D Gazebo simulator and the Python programming language. For each exercise, a software template has been developed, performing all the auxiliary tasks such as the graphical interface, connection to the sensors and actuators, timing of the code, etc. This also hosts the student’s code. Using this template, the student just focuses on the robot intelligence (for instance, perception and control algorithms) without wasting time on auxiliary details which have little educational value. The templates are coded as ROS nodes or as Jupyter Notebooks ready to use in the web browser. Reference solutions for illustrative purposes and automatic assessment tools for gamification have also been developed. An introductory course to intelligent robotics has been elaborated and its contents are available and ready to use at Robotics-Academy, including reactive behaviors, path planning, local/global navigation, and self-localization algorithms. Robotics- Academy provides a valuable complement to master classes in blended learning, massive online open courses (MOOCs) and online video courses, devoted to addressing theoretical content. This open educational tool connects that theory with practical robot applications and is suitable to be used in distance education.

A major part of the SC training program relies on simulations, which are challenging and costly when dealing with more than 80,000 soldiers. In 2014, the French Military Health Service decided to develop and deploy 3D-SC1, a serious game (SG) intended to train and assess soldiers managing the early steps of SC. Objectives: The purpose of this paper is to describe the creation and production of 3D-SC1 and to present its deployment. Methods: A group of 10 experts and the Paris Descartes University Medical Simulation Department spin-off, Medusims, coproduced 3D-SC1. Medusims are virtual medical experiences using 3D real-time videogame technology (creation of an environment and avatars in different scenarios) designed for educational purposes (training and assessment) to simulate medical situations. These virtual situations have been created based on real cases and tested on mannequins by experts. Trainees are asked to manage specific situations according to best practices recommended by SC, and receive a score and a personalized feedback regarding their performance. Results: The scenario simulated in the SG is an attack on a patrol of 3 soldiers with an improvised explosive device explosion as a result of which one soldier dies, one soldier is slightly stunned, and the third soldier experiences a leg amputation and other injuries. This scenario was first tested with mannequins in military simulation centers, before being transformed into a virtual 3D real-time scenario using a multi-support, multi-operating system platform, Unity. Processes of gamification and scoring were applied, with 2 levels of difficulty. A personalized debriefing was integrated at the end of the simulations. The design and production of the SG took 9 months. The deployment, performed in 3 months, has reached 84 of 96 (88%) French Army units, with a total of 818 hours of connection in the first 3 months. Conclusions: The development of 3D-SC1 involved a collaborative platform with interdisciplinary actors from the French Health Service, a university, and videogame industry.

The literature reviewed showed a lack of design principles applied to the development of serious games for children with ADHD and more particularly to learn mathematics. More and more in our context we have to consider alternative solutions including the use of technology in response to the special needs of this sector of the population. Our serious game was designed to meet thirteen children diagnosed with ADHD, six special education teachers, parents, as well as specialists in the care of the ADHD. The work that has been done with them consists of semi-structured interviews, observation by class intervals, a Wizard of Oz experiment and a CSUQ e to measure system usability, information quality, interface quality and overall user satisfaction. In this paper, we present the results, although not conclusive, are encouraging, as they show a high percentage of agreement between users' satisfaction and the serious game tested. At the same time, children and teachers showed motivation and enthusiasm in the use of these types of resources to promote children's learning, especially those diagnosed with ADDH.

Gamification in higher education can provide to students better opportunities to develop commitment skills, increasing their motivation and making them more interested in what they are learning. The purpose of this review is to collect information, synthesize and integrate published works on the influence of gamification with the motivation and learning of students. With this, it is intended to establish the current state of knowledge on gamification in education, which will allow a better approach to future lines of research. Representative studies were identified through a systematic search in 4 databases: EBSCO SPORTDISCUS, SCOPUS, ISI and SCHOLAR GOOGLE, extracting data about the study design, participants, variables, instruments and results. We included 22 studies, 19 originals and 3 reviews of the literature. Initial evidence indicates that gamification in higher education motivates students and improves their learning, providing university students with better opportunities to develop commitment skills. The use of PBL (Points, Badges and Leaderboards) improves motivation and is considered as an adequate combination of mechanics in the implementation of any gamification process in higher education.

""Earthquake in the city"" was implemented in a school in Tehran, Iran, and its effectiveness on learning the concepts of professional commitment was evaluated. ""Earthquake in the city"" was built based upon a fantasy scenario occurring in an imaginary city. Each student took on a role in the city (citizen or healthcare provider). After finishing the game, participants were asked about the concept of professional commitment. Their definition was scored by a group of medical ethics experts separately in terms of compliance with the actual definitions and compared with their peers in the control group who did not participate in the game. A group of 16-year-old teenagers studying in the 11th grade participated in this intervention. The average score of conformity with the actual concept of professional commitment among the case group participants was significantly higher than the average value for the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The results of this study could provide insights to planners and educators engaged in the education system so that gamification can be incorporated as an influential tool to teach the concepts of professional commitment.

However, most of the currently available nutrition apps lack scientific evaluation and user acceptance. Objective: The objective of this study was the systematic design of a theory-driven and target group–adapted dietary mobile app concept to promote healthy eating habits with a focus on drinking habits as well as consumption of fruits and vegetables in adolescents and young adults, especially from disadvantaged backgrounds. Methods: The design process was guided by the behavior change wheel (BCW). The development process comprised 3 stages. In stage 1, the target behavior was specified, and facilitators and barriers were identified. Furthermore, important insights into target group interests, needs, and values in the field of nutrition and apps were revealed. To this end, 2 empirical studies were conducted with the target group. In stage 2, results of stage 1 were translated into behavior change techniques (BCTs) and, finally, into app functionalities and features. Consequently, in stage 3, the concept was evaluated and optimized through expert interviews. Results: Facilitators and barriers for achieving the target behavior were psychological capabilities (eg, self-efficacy), reflective motivation (eg, fitness), automatic motivation, social support, and physical opportunity (eg, time). Target group interests, needs, and values in the field of nutrition were translated into target group preferences for app usage, for example, low usage effort, visual feedback, or recipes. Education, training, incentives, persuasion, and enablement were identified as relevant intervention functions. Together with the target group preferences, these were translated via 14 BCTs, such as rewards, graded tasks, or self-monitoring into the app concept Challenge to go (C2go). The expert evaluation suggested changes of some app features for improving adherence, positive health effects, and technical feasibility. The C2go concept comprises 3 worlds: the (1) drinking, (2) vegetable, and (3) fruit worlds. In each world, the users are faced with challenges including feedback and a quiz. Tips were developed based on the health action process approach and to help users gain challenges and, thereby, achieve the target behavior. Challenges can be played alone or against someone in the community. Due to different activities, points can be collected, and levels can be achieved. Collected points open access to an Infothek (information section), where users can choose content that interests them. An avatar guides user through the app. Conclusions: C2go is aimed at adolescents and young adults and aims to improve their fruit and vegetable consumption as well as drinking habits. It is a theory-driven and target group–adapted dietary mobile intervention concept that uses gamification and was systematically developed using the BCW. © Anna Rohde, Anja Duensing, Christine Dawczynski, Jasmin Godemann, Stefan Lorkowski, Christine Brombach.";"22915222";6;"Switzerland";"Scopus"

Due to inconsistent practice opportunities in the clinical setting, a disparity of skill levels among students has been observed. In addition, the poor availability of faculty professors is a limiting factor in teaching and adequately preparing medical students for their clerkship years. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, medical students do not have access to traditional suturing learning opportunities. Didactic courses are available on videoconferencing platforms; however, these courses do not include technical training. Objective: Our overarching goal is to evaluate the efficacy and usability of web-based peer-learning for advanced suturing techniques (ie, running subcuticular sutures). We will use the Gamified Educational Network (GEN), a newly developed web-based learning tool. We will assess students’ ability to identify and perform the correct technique. We will also assess the students’ satisfaction with regard to GEN. Methods: We will conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial with blinding of expert examiners. First-year medical students in the Faculty of Medicine of Université de Montréal will be randomized into four groups: (1) control, (2) self-learning, (3) peer-learning, and (4) peer-learning with expert feedback. Each arm will have 15 participants who will learn how to perform running subcuticular sutures through videos on GEN. For our primary outcome, the students’ ability to identify the correct technique will be evaluated before and after the intervention on GEN. The students will view eight videos and rate the surgical techniques using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills Global Rating Scale and the Subcuticular Suture Checklist as evaluation criteria. For our secondary outcomes, students will anonymously record themselves performing a running subcuticular suture and will be evaluated using the same scales. Then, a survey will be sent to assess the students’ acceptance of the intervention. Results: The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and has been approved by our institutional review board (CERSES 20-068-D). No participants have been recruited yet. Conclusions: Peer learning through GEN has the potential to overcome significant limitations related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of availability of faculty professors. Further, a decrease of the anxiety related to traditional suturing classes can be expected. We aim to create an innovative and sustainable method of teaching surgical skills to improve the efficiency and quality of surgical training in medical faculties. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for such tools is imperative. ©Natasha Guérard-Poirier, Michèle Beniey, Léamarie Meloche-Dumas, Florence Lebel-Guay, Bojana Misheva, Myriam Abbas, Malek Dhane, Myriam Elraheb, Adam Dubrowski, Erica Patocskai.";"19290748";NA;"Canada";"Scopus"

Programming is difficult for students to learn, given that it includes a lot of new, complex, and abstract topics. All of this has led experts to the conclusion that new teaching techniques are required if students are to be motivated and engaged in learning on programming courses. Gamification has come to be an effective technique in education in general, and is especially useful in programming courses. This motivated us to develop an open source gamified platform, called UDPiler, for use in a programming course. Objective: The main goal of this article is to obtain empirical evidence on the improvement of students' learning performance when using UDPiler in comparison to a non-gamified compiler. Method: A quasi-experiment was performed with two groups of first-year engineering students at Diego Portales University in Chile, using a non-gamified compiler and a gamified platform, respectively. Results: The results reveal that the students obtained better marks when the gamified platform was used to learn C programming. In addition, there is statistical significance in favor of there being a positive effect on the learning performance of those students who used the gamified platform. Conclusions: The results allow us to conclude that gamification is an encouraging approach with which to teach C programming, a finding that is aligned with previous empirical studies concerning gamification on programming courses, carried out in academic contexts. Nonetheless, we are aware that further validation is also required to corroborate and strengthen the findings obtained and to investigate whether the kind of gamified elements (mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics) used have any influence on students' performance, among other issues that deserve further investigation and that are explained throughout this article. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.";"19466226";18;"Spain";"Scopus"

Using a standardised rubric, a sample of gamified activities is studied to measure the prevalence of the various components used to implement gamification. This research provides an empirically validated catalogue of specific components used to implement gamification, which can serve to guide the work of academics and practitioners. It demonstrates variance in the use of the different types of component, indicating that the utility of gamification components may differ.

They all collect learning data and analyse learning behaviours, and ultimately achieve personalised learning dynamically. However, further research is needed on the ways to effectively access and analyse information about learning within an enjoyable environment and with positive results when realising personalised learning. In order to solve this problem, we connect the time in class and after class with semantic knowledge and combine these elements with gamification and a better interaction experience. We explore whether this teaching method can offer students a better learning experience and positive learning outcomes. Our approach plays an obvious role in personalised learning. Our results indicate that a teaching method which connects the two parts of a class with gamification and a means of interaction in AR (augmented reality) produces novel and enjoyable feelings, stimulates students' enthusiasm and improves the learning effects when they do personalised learning. © Authors.";"13058215";11;"Portugal";"Scopus"

The main goal is the creation of a technological infrastructure for the permanent enhancement of cultural resources. Hence, ArkaeVision represents a user-centric integrated system able to offer different modalities of exploitation of Cultural Heritage assets, including virtual representations of monuments, works of art and objects, as well as the stories associated to them. ArkaeVision therefore introduces a new communication paradigm, made of game-alike exploration of a 3D environment, virtually reconstructed, with elements of digital fiction and an engaging stortytelling, applied to two case studies: the exploration of the Hera II Temple of Paestum with Virtual Reality (VR) technology, and the exploration of the slab of the Swimmer Tomb with Augmented Reality (AR). The emotional component is fundamental in ArkaeVision, because it generates the motivation and leads people to use immersive viewers, as the HTC Vive, which allow the learning process to be activated more quickly, as many cognitivists and psychologists reported in the latest researches. Also the involvement of users through gamification is well expressed in ArkaeVision. This model of action (and interaction) designed for the public allows to emphasize the role of users through a system that is “guided” by their choices and times, in order to increase users’ engagement within the virtual exploration, and favour the content understanding by direct experience. Evaluations conducted on a preliminary prototype suggested that the communicative approach is very promising for education and engagement into cultural heritage experiences. © 2019";"22120548";13;"Italy";"Scopus"

The so-called “digital natives” acquire, as a consequence of their early exposure to these technologies, different patterns of work, distinct attention conducts, new learning preferences and, generally, better skills for learning and working within rich online social contexts. So, it seems reasonable that the traditional education systems evolve and shape their practice to leverage those new patterns. Despite the fact that online social networks (osns) are widely recognized as a powerful vector for adding a new social dimension to the learning management systems (lmss), osns do not fully integrate the specific features of the learning process yet and traditional lmss do not exploit the advantages of an active social environment for reinforcing the learning experience. In this paper, we report the design, implementation, and use of a software platform (SocialWire) that leverages on the basic capabilities of an osn and extends the functionality toward its use in very general learning environments. We argue that this approach, together with gamification elements, is helpful in increasing the students’ motivation, besides improving the learning experience and performance. This software system has been in use for 3 years in different subject areas in our university. Our outcomes and the feedback provided both by teachers and students support the introduction of social features, gamification elements, and informal processes into the traditional teaching practices. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In game-based learning, the learner's engagement is increased and learning is made meaningful by applying game-like features such as competition and rewarding through virtual promotions or achievement badges. In this paper, the state of the art of game-based learning in building services engineering education at university level is reviewed and discussed. A systematic literature review indicates that educational games have been reported in the field of related disciplines, such as mechanical and civil engineering. The development of system-level educational games that realistically simulate work life in building services engineering is still in its infancy.

Collective intelligence could potentially decrease the error rates of nonexperts. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and impact of collective intelligence for the detection of skin cancer. Methods: We created a gamified study platform on a stack of established Web technologies and presented 4216 dermatoscopic images of the most common benign and malignant pigmented skin lesions to 1245 human raters with different levels of experience. Raters were recruited via scientific meetings, mailing lists, and social media posts. Education was self-declared, and domain-specific experience was tested by screening tests. In the target test, the readers had to assign 30 dermatoscopic images to 1 of the 7 disease categories. The readers could repeat the test with different lesions at their own discretion. Collective human intelligence was achieved by sampling answers from multiple readers. The disease category with most votes was regarded as the collective vote per image. Results: We collected 111,019 single ratings, with a mean of 25.2 (SD 18.5) ratings per image. As single raters, nonexperts achieved a lower mean accuracy (58.6%) than experts (68.4%; mean difference=-9.4%; 95% CI -10.74% to -8.1%; P<.001). Collectives of nonexperts achieved higher accuracies than single raters, and the improvement increased with the size of the collective. A collective of 4 nonexperts surpassed single nonexperts in accuracy by 6.3% (95% CI 6.1% to 6.6%; P<.001). The accuracy of a collective of 8 nonexperts was 9.7% higher (95% CI 9.5% to 10.29%; P<.001) than that of single nonexperts, an improvement similar to single experts (P=.73). The sensitivity for malignant images increased for nonexperts (66.3% to 77.6%) and experts (64.6% to 79.4%) for answers given faster than the intrarater mean. Conclusions: A high number of raters can be attracted by elements of gamification and Web-based marketing via mailing lists and social media. Nonexperts increase their accuracy to expert level when acting as a collective, and faster answers correspond to higher accuracy.

We describe here AntibioGame®, a serious game for improving the training of medical students in antibiotic use in primary care. Objective: We aimed to design a serious game for antibiotics teaching and to evaluate its usability and playability by medical students. Methods: We used various gamification techniques (e.g. use of mascots, avatars, rewards, leader board) and cartoon graphics in the design of AntibioGame®. This game implements clinical case templates built from a list of learning goals defined by a medical team through an analysis of clinical practice guidelines. The game was evaluated by asking medical students to rate their satisfaction and the usability and playability of the game on an electronic form and through group discussions. The electronic form was derived from the MEEGA + scale, a five-point Likert scale including 32 items for assessing both usability and playability. Results: AntibioGame® is a case-based game in which students play the role of a doctor meeting patients in consultation and helping other health professionals to solve their problems, as in real life. The scenarios are realistic and cover situations frequently encountered in primary care. The 57 medical students enrolled found the game attractive, usable, fun, and appropriate for learning. Game quality was considered “good” (score = 60 on the MEEGA + scale). All the students said they would recommend the game, 96 % liked it and 81 % would use it for revision. Conclusion: AntibioGame® is a promising tool for improving knowledge in antibiotic prescription that could easily be included in multifaceted programs for training medical students. © 2020 The Authors";"13865056";4;"France";"Scopus"

As other basic engineering subjects, it needs an active participation of the students in the learning process. However, nowadays, one of the main difficult to teach this kind of disciplines is to keep the student's motivation and participation in the learning process. For this reason, the use of new tools, as the educational gamification, can help to change the way to understand and teach this subject (Ballesteros et al., 2019). In this context, the application of game-based activities to engineering education has increased in popularity among students (Blumenfeld et al., 1991). In this work, we present the application of a escape room-based to heat transfer interactive evaluation for third year chemical engineering students. The plot of our escape lab-room is focused on a crazy scientific (Dr. Nusselito Graetzoff) that is obsessed with the heat transfer. He has retained a group of scientists and has the code for a missile launch. It is a national security case! The students (distributed by groups) play the role of heat transfer specialists from different Research Centers, which have to complete two missions: release the imprisoned scientists, and avoid the missile launch planned by Dr. Nusselito. Therefore, the students have to solve different questions/cases related to heat transfer issues, obtaining the codes that will allow them to complete their mission. The plot of the activity is conducted by using videos, in which the different parts of the activity are described. In addition, the professors supervise and help the correct progress of the escape room. We used the same kind of theoretical and applied problems in both evaluation methods, traditional exam and escape room one. After this experience, we can confirm the increase of student participation regarding to previous years. In addition, the students showed enthusiastic attitude (Fig. 1a) and a high satisfaction level. Therefore, the students’ participation of escape lab-room, to heat transfer teaching was completely successful, although this activity only accounts for a 10 % of the total course score. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers";"17497728";2;"Spain";"Scopus"

The continuous learning loops were formed using the gamification mechanism and transformation, enabling students to connect and practice the three elements of empathy ability: emotion, cognition and expression. Via the game elements of competition, interaction, storytelling, real-time responses, concretizing feedback, integrated peer learning, and equality between teachers and students, students who play patient roles are able to perceive different levels of comfort, which encourages the development of insight into the meaning of empathy. Thereby, the goals of the empathy lesson is achievable within a creative game-based learning environment.";"0047262X";1;"Taiwan";"Scopus"

The management of tuberculosis education through the DOTS program is performed in clinics and hospitals only to patients and their families. The purpose of this study is to describe the development and testing of a prototype (social-game education) for interactive education for tuberculosis patients in particular and the general public. The data collection process is through direct observation of tuberculosis patients and health professionals (doctors, nurses, and DOTS health workers). Challenge the game in the prototype was provided with content that contained tuberculosis information that had been previously validated by a specialist. In addition to tuberculosis information as the main content, two important elements are making up this prototype, which are gamification and social media elements. In the game elements, this study adopted elements of the leaderboard, badge/achievement, challenge, and level. As for the third element, social media includes likes, comments, and shares. Prototype application testing was conducted on two participant groups (N = 48) consisting of 23 tuberculosis patients and 25 random participants. By using the user experience questionnaire (UEQ) technique, this research focuses on identifying the user's motivation in capturing compositional information as well as the clarity of the prototype.

Previous works deal with teaching about privacy using educational online content, and media literacy. However, these tools do not necessarily promote less risky behaviors, and do not allow the assessment of users' behavior after the learning period. Moreover, few research studies about the effects of social gamification have been performed for this population segment (i.e., teenagers). To address this problem in this article, we propose the use of gamification in an OSN called Pesedia to facilitate the teaching/learning process, and assess its effectiveness in promoting suitable privacy behaviors. We tested our proposal comparing teenagers' performance in two editions of a course about social networks, and privacy (with, and without gamification) for one month. We measured the impact of gamification in the participants' behaviors toward privacy concepts as a consequence of the privacy teaching/learning process, and the participants' engagement in the educational process. The results show that there are significant differences in participants' behavior regarding privacy, and engagement in the gamified social network. Moreover, there is also a significant difference in participants' engagement for the gamified male participants. The gamified social network proposed in this article may be relevant, and useful for educators who wish to develop, and enhance teenagers' privacy skills, or for a broader base of aspects related to the development of digital competences, and technology in education. © 2008-2011 IEEE.";"19391382";NA;"Spain";"Scopus"

Platforms such as Kahoot!, accompanied by the student's smartphone, allow the teacher to create a classroom response system (CRS) a fast and straightforward way. The present study, with a non-experimental design, is developed to assess the use of this tool in higher education, both in a face-to-face format and through a virtual learning environment. After applying an electronic questionnaire (20 items; α=.958) to a sample of 148 students (94 in the face-to-face mode and 54 in the virtual mode) whose teachers had used Kahoot! with the same methodological planning, a high degree of predisposition for their employment as future teaching professionals and positive perception of the resource is detected, especially when assessing their potential for self-assessment of the learning process and assimilation of the basic concepts of the subject.

Lessons cannot be envisaged without the use of tools such as computers, tablets or mobile devices. Many lecturers use audience response systems (ARS) to keep their classes engaged. ARS software allows teachers to interact with students via polls, text responses, or multiple-choice questions displayed via their mobile devices. A new example of the use of this type of devices in education is gamification, a technique that uses a set of activities with ludic character as a learning methodology in order to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge and competences. One of the most used gamification tools is Kahoot!, a free learning application based on a mixture of game and creativity, which encourages attention and participation of students through questions and answers formulated by the teacher and designed in a way that students respond via their mobile phones. This paper examines the use of Kahoot! in a subject belonging to the chemistry area. In order to assess the benefits of this tool, it was tested in a group of students to review the knowledge and skills acquired during the theoretical lessons prior to the exams, and the academic results were compared with those of a control group of students who did not use the tool. The results demonstrate that the use of Kahoot! led to an improvement in the teaching–learning process of the students and a noteworthy rise in their marks, and that its positive effects rise with increasing the frequency of use of this didactic tool. © 2020 by the authors.

To succeed, players must collaborate and think critically and creatively. Our objectives were to provide a novel team-building activity, teach interesting content about radiology as a specialty, cultivate grit, and share the game with other programs. Materials and Methods: Escape Rooms were held during orientation (BOOT Camp) for incoming radiology residents and for upper level residents and faculty with advanced content (four teams totaling 20 residents and faculty). We repeated the Escape Room 27 times for 144 residents from more than 10 countries at Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) 2018. Results: Players were engaged and competitive. They were able to connect the activity to their future responsibilities – analyzing knowledge under pressure (being on call), communicating effectively (conveying results and recommendations), having the dexterity and motor skills required for physical puzzles (hand-on procedures), being able to multi-task and come up with differential diagnoses under extreme stress and time pressure (being on call). A post-RSNA survey confirmed satisfaction with the activity, with overall enjoyment receiving the highest rating. Conclusion: It is feasible to create a portable, inexpensive Escape Room as a novel educational platform for radiology residents.

Video games, however, are very successful at sustaining high levels of motivation and engagement through a set of tasks for hours without apparent loss of focus. In addition, gamers solve complex problems within a gaming environment without feeling fatigue or frustration, as they would typically do with a comparable learning task. Based on this notion, the academic community is keen on exploring methods that can deliver deep learner engagement and has shown increased interest in adopting gamification – the integration of gaming elements, mechanics, and frameworks into non-game situations and scenarios – as a means to increase student engagement and improve information retention. Its effectiveness when applied to education has been debatable though, as attempts have generally been restricted to one-dimensional approaches such as transposing a trivial reward system onto existing teaching materials and/or assessments. Nevertheless, a gamified, multi-dimensional, problem-based learning approach can yield improved results even when applied to a very complex and traditionally dry task like the teaching of computer programming, as shown in this paper. The presented quasi-experimental study used a combination of instructor feedback, real time sequence of scored quizzes, and live coding to deliver a fully interactive learning experience. More specifically, the “Kahoot!” Classroom Response System (CRS), the classroom version of the TV game show “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?”, and Codecademy’s interactive platform formed the basis for a learning model which was applied to an entry-level Python programming course. Students were thus allowed to experience multiple interlocking methods similar to those commonly found in a top quality game experience. To assess gamification’s impact on learning, empirical data from the gamified group were compared to those from a control group who was taught through a traditional learning approach, similar to the one which had been used during previous cohorts. Despite this being a relatively small-scale study, the results and findings for a number of key metrics, including attendance, downloading of course material, and final grades, were encouraging and proved that the gamified approach was motivating and enriching for both students and instructors. © ACPIL.";"14794403";67;"United Kingdom";"Scopus"

This workshop also uses deductive and inductive modes of clinical reasoning and provides opportunities for learners to practice toggling from one to another while reviewing. Methods: Using exemplar musculoskeletal vignettes, this workshop allows residents to practice engaging and toggling between both modes of information processing. This workshop also includes pre- and posttests, small-group learning, and a small-group competition. Results: The workshop was implemented with a group of 26 physical medicine and rehabilitation residents. Although residents did well on the pretest, the workshop improved their test performance. Residents liked the workshop and thought it improved their diagnostic ability. Discussion: A workshop that included team- and case-based learning, key features assessment, script theory, and gamification was effective in engaging residents and resulted in high resident satisfaction and the perception of increased ability to tackle clinical problems. Learning from our experience with the previous workshop resulted in significant reduction in faculty time required, and increased the number of residents who were able to complete both pre- and posttests.";"23748265";NA;"United States";"Scopus"

In the future, it is expected that gamification will overtake the traditional way of learning resulting in issues such as scalability, upgradation of learning modules. To address these issues, merging gamification with cloud computing seems a viable solution. However, the employability of gamification through cloud computing is still in its infant stage. Hence, this article investigates the applicability of gamification through cloud computing and presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art gamification in education and learning. We also identify the subject areas that can be gamified and taught using the cloud service. The critical elements and minimum requirements necessary to gamify education are also identified. Moreover, a specific cloud-assisted gamification architecture is proposed and discussed together with its possible applications.

Design/methodology/approach: Dietrich et al. (2017) six-step framework was applied to a co-design project involving four groups of 14- to 16-year-old Australian high school students. Data collection included observations by three facilitators, written feedback from members of each group and video presentations of the generated ideas. The data analysis focused on investigating the applicability of the six-step framework to young consumers and evaluating the quality and practicality of the generated ideas. Findings: Sensitization is key to enabling young consumers to become equal participants during the co-design process. Sensitization allowed the participants to engage in the design task in a playful manner, which fostered active participation and creative insights during the co-design session. A team approach based on interactivity and group autonomy enabled adolescents to contribute insights into their specific needs and wants. This was complemented by a trusting environment and the presence of immediately available yet “hands off” facilitators. Research limitations/implications: The findings are limited to one specific sample and design task. Future research is required that investigates co-design with young consumers in different contexts. Practical implications: This paper provides guidance for the application of co-design with young consumers by highlighting the importance of sensitization and facilitation. Originality/value: This study marks one of the first approaches to co-designing alcohol education programs, including VR components, with young consumers. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the consequences of involving young consumers through co-design. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.";"17473616";21;"Sweden";"Scopus"

The impact and consequences of this innovative technology have not yet been satisfactory explored. This empirical study investigated the cognitive and social aspects of collaboration in a shared, immersive virtual reality. A unique application for implementing a collaborative immersive virtual environment (CIVE) was developed by our interdisciplinary team as a software solution for educational purposes, with two scenarios for learning about hypsography, i.e., explanations of contour line principles. Both scenarios allow switching between a usual 2D contour map and a 3D model of the corresponding terrain to increase the intelligibility and clarity of the educational content. Gamification principles were also applied to both scenarios to augment user engagement during the completion of tasks. A qualitative research approach was adopted to obtain a deep insight into the lived experience of users in a CIVE. It was thus possible to form a deep understanding of very new subject matter. Twelve pairs of participants were observed during their CIVE experience and then interviewed either in a semistructured interview or a focus group. Data from these three research techniques were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis, which is research method for studying individual experience. Four superordinate themes-with detailed descriptions of experiences shared by numerous participants-emerged as results from the analysis; we called these (1) Appreciation for having a collaborator, (2) The Surprising ""Fun with Maps"", (3) Communication as a challenge, and (4) Cognition in two realities.

An innovative burn prevention intervention was developed using these channels. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Cool Runnings, an app-based intervention to increase knowledge of childhood burn risk (specifically hot beverage scalds) and correct burn first aid among mothers of young children. Methods: This was a 2-group, parallel, single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants were women aged 18 years and above, living in Queensland, Australia, with at Least 1 child aged 5-12 months at time of enrollment. The primary outcome measures were change in knowledge about risk of burns and correct burn first aid assessed via 2 methods: (1) overall score and (2) categorized as adequate (score=4) versus inadequate (score<4). Efficacy of gamification techniques was also assessed. Results: In total, 498 participants were recruited via social media and enrolled. At the 6-month follow-up, 244 participants completed the posttest questionnaire. Attrition rates in both groups were similar. Participants who remained in the study did not differ from those lost to follow-up on any characteristics except education level. Although similar at baseline, intervention group participants achieved significantly greater improvement in overall knowledge posttest than control group participants on both primary outcome measures (overall knowledge intervention: mean [SD] of overall knowledge 2.68 [SD 1.00] for intervention vs 2.13 [SD 1.03] for control; 20.7% [25/121] adequate in intervention vs 7.3% [2/123] in control). Consequently, the number needed to treat was 7.46. Logistic regression showed participants exposed to the highest level of disadvantage had 7.3 times higher odds of improved overall knowledge scores than participants in other levels of disadvantage. There were also significant correlations between gamification techniques and knowledge change (P<.001). In addition, odds of knowledge improvement between baseline and 6-month follow-up was higher in participants with low-moderate app activity compared with no app activity (odds ratio [OR] 8.59, 95% CI 2.9-25.02) and much higher in participants with high app activity (OR 18.26, 95% CI 7.1-46.8). Conclusions: Despite substantial loss to follow-up, this RCT demonstrates the Cool Runnings app was an effective intervention for improving knowledge about risks of hot beverage scalds and burn first aid in mothers of young children. The benefits of combining gamification elements in the intervention were also highlighted. Given the low cost and large reach of smartphone apps to deliver content to and engage with targeted populations, the results from this RCT provide important information on how smartphone apps can be used for widespread injury prevention campaigns and public health campaigns generally. © Jacqueline Burgess, Kerrianne Watt, Roy M Kimble, Cate M Cameron.";"14388871";6;"Australia";"Scopus"

The increase in teaching and learning methodologies that are mediated by ICT in the field of education and in the domestic settings encourages the design of new effective technological tools, supported by scientific research and development to improve student learning. The challenge psychology is facing in the education field is to promote those technologies and make them available to the education community. Technologies also would produce attractive items for users and realistic commercial issues for businesses. This also allows an effective transfer for scientific work, providing visibility to Research and Development. In this context, the main aim of the article is to describe the process to get an agreement between Babyradio (a children's entertainment company: https://babyradio.es/) and our research team, starting a collaborative work between two groups of people (Babyradio's technical designer and Psychologist-Engineers software designer), in order to create several educative applications (APPs) in the field of early mathematics cognition. The institutional framework of the relationship of the R & D project and a children's entertainment company is described. The article also focuses on experience in Psychology, Technological Innovation, and Entrepreneurship. In considering the efficiency of the agreement, we present different APPs designed for tablets and smartphone devices, adapted to the different operating systems (IOS, Android, Windows). APPs are designed to instill the cognitive fundamentals associated with early math learning for students aged 4 to 7 years. The study developed after this babyradio-university enterprise agreement contributes to the development of mathematics skills in children, aged 4-7 years, so that they can successfully meet the mathematics school requirements; it also contributes to encouraging a more positive attitude toward mathematics. This study also suggests how the education system and software and educational content developers' companies would manage verified instructional APPs, with a more realistic commercial perspective. © 2019 Mera, Ruiz, Aguilar, Aragón, Delgado, Menacho, Marchena, García Sedeño and Navarro.";"16641078";3;"Spain";"Scopus"

To reach this goal, a quality and inclusive education together with a proper and complete formation in technology (communications, robotics, programming, computational thinking (CT), etc.) must be imparted at all educational levels. Moreover, all individuals should have the same opportunities to develop their skills and knowledge, as stated in Goal 4 of the Sustainable Development Goals, Sustainable Education. Following this trend, in the present work, a practical experience about how to teach CT using robotics is developed, showing the results and evaluation of the lessons on robotics taught to students in their 4th year of compulsory secondary education, and where the students showed a high degree of apathy and demotivation. The teaching unit was based on an action research approach that includes a careful selection of pedagogical techniques and instruments to attract and keep the attention and interest of the students. In addition to the robotics lessons, a previous computational thinking training with Blockly Games was carried out, which contributed to noticeably increase the students motivation and to introduce them to the programming of robots. Moreover, gamification was used to motivate and evaluate the individual knowledge, and the students were required to present the work performed through a final project. The individual needs of the students were fulfilled with a daily monitoring. The results show that the pedagogical techniques, instruments and evaluation were adequate to increase the motivation of the students and to obtain a significant learning, showing how the teaching of CT may attract students that have lost interest and motivation, while providing them with abilities that will be essential for the learning throughout life. © 2019 by the authors.";"20711050";10;"Spain";"Scopus"

One of such phenomena is serious play. Traditionally, the playful and the serious, at the intersection of which serious play arises, are positioned as independent and mutually exclusive elements of the social world. We examine what changes in the social reality, in the relations of the playful and the serious, in the position of man in modern social processes make serious play possible and how serious play redetermines the conditions of its occurrence. For this, we used methods of philosophical analysis and hermeneutics: interpretation, conceptualization, comparative analysis. As a theoretical and methodological basis, we used the categorical apparatus of social philosophy, theory of practice, pragmatism, and social epistemology. As a result, we found that serious play is thought of as a social process in the range from an individual to global scale. In serious play, the subject, through the generation of meanings, performs both the production and reproduction of culture in predetermined ontoaxiological bases, and constructs these bases, while realizing the degree of his freedom, responsibility and immersion in the world he creates through his practices. The significance of the results of our research lies in the fact that the concept of serious play at the intersection of serious and game relations reveals the potential of serious play as an element of sociocultural reality. Serious play reflects the level of complexity of modern reality and ensures that a person adapts to the ever-increasing dynamics of this complexity. The trend of gamification registers this in the space of higher education, which causes a change in the role of the university in the modern social world. Serious play redefines the position of a person in the modern, dynamic and individualized social world. For the first time, serious play is conceptualized at the intersection of the playful and the serious as independent and mutually exclusive elements of sociocultural reality and is analyzed in the trend of the gamification of higher education. © 2020 LLC Ecological Help.

Although there have been a number of programmes aimed at preventing scalds in children, very few have specifically addressed hot beverage scalds, and fewer have reported a reduction in injury rates. In Australia, hot beverage scalds account for 18 % of all childhood burns - a figure that has remained constant for the past decade. Innovative new technologies, such as Smartphone applications (apps), present a novel way for delivering individual-level injury prevention messages. The low cost, scalability and broad reach make this technology an ideal channel for health interventions. One of the latest methods being used in health-related apps aimed at behaviour change is gamification. Gamification uses the gaming principles of rewards, competition and personalisation to engage participants and motivate them towards preferred behaviours. This intervention will use a Smartphone app-based platform that combines gamification and behaviour-change strategies to increase knowledge and awareness of hot beverage scald risks and burn first aid among mothers of young children. Methods/design: This is a two-group, parallel, single-blinded randomised control trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of a Smartphone app-based injury prevention intervention. The primary outcome measure is change in knowledge. Change in knowledge is measured in three components: knowledge of correct burns first aid; knowledge of the main cause of burns/scalds in children aged 0-15yrs; knowledge of the main age group at risk for burns/scalds. The secondary outcome measures relate to the gamification methods, measuring participants frequency of engagement with the Cool Runnings app. Queensland-based mothers aged 18+ years who own a Smartphone and have at least one child aged 5-12 months are eligible to participate. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate an app-based delivery of injury prevention messages, and the first study to test the efficacy of gamification techniques in an injury prevention intervention. If this intervention is found to be effective, this RCT will provide a platform for targeting other childhood injury prevention campaigns.

These technologies may be distinguished based on education content and approach into the following three categories: Online-offline digital education, which uses massive open online courses, CD-ROM, and similar learning tools; mobile learning, which uses mobile phones, tablets, and other devices to connect to the Internet of things; and digital simulation education, which uses virtual reality, virtual patient simulation, serious gaming, and gamification. Preliminary positive findings regarding the effectiveness of using the above technologies have been reported in the literature. Therefore, to better understand the impact of new technology, it is recommended that relevant medical/nursing educators should continue introducing practical courses to evaluate their impact on learning. However, funding limitations and the declining birthrate/population aging are two key threats to education that remain to be effectively addressed and overcome. © 2020, Taiwan Nurses Association.

While there was a soaring increase in the number of enrollments for this stage of schooling, there was also a decline in the institutionality of the school and an intensification of a certain grammar of the pedagogical crisis. Driven by constant educational reforms, a strong political investment in High School is observed focusing both on teacher's training and on the production of school curricula adjusted to the new demands of 21st century society. Therefore, this text analytically considers the relationships established between the school curriculum and the recent policies and practices for teacher's training for High School implemented in the Brazilian context. Based on curricular studies and traditions of contemporary social theory, especially on recent writings by Gilles Lipovestsky, three scenes of initial teacher's training that took place in courses in southern Brazil, developed by public and private Higher Education Institutions, will be examined. Such experiences seem to show a decline in academic legitimacy in the recent training models in favor of a centrality of practices, a gamification of procedures and the fading of curricular knowledge and its public function. © 2020, Emerson de Pietri.";"15179702";NA;"Brazil";"Scopus"

The benefits of tourist destinations in Indonesia finally form three patterns, namely natural, cultural, and human-made. City and village tourism are very popular with the community because of the high interest of the community to capture the moments of Instagram able and viral tourism spots. One of them is village tourism. For people who are educated with life in the village, it is necessary to make it more interesting with gamification. In this study, the aim was to change the pattern of visitors' activities, which initially only took pictures but were also invited to explore the village potential through a mobile application. Also, this study is used to improve and help preserve and introduce village tourism potential. Gamification can be an alternative to developing village tourism potential. A common occurrence in tourist villages is a lack of management innovation to add village tourism potential to visitors further. So, we design mobile village tourism for village education.

However, problems exist in current learning recommender systems available to students in that they are often general learning content and unable to offer personalized service. To overcome this, in the context of a learning style based on an Interpretive Structural Model (ISM), an adaptive learning path recommendation system is proposed comprising: (a) Fuzzy Delphi Method, (b) Fuzzy ISM and (c) Kelly Repertory Grid Technology. The results show that the learning outcome with ALPRS is better than those from general learning course guided recommendation mechanisms, and the scores of system satisfaction with ALPRS and personal service are higher than 90%. Results of recall (95%), precision (68%), F1 index (45%) and MAE (8%) prove that ALPRS outperforms other approaches.

Gamification is starting to play an important role in education with the objective of providing engagement and improving the motivation of students. One specific example is the use of badges. The analysis of users' interactions and behaviors with the badge system can be used to improve the learning process, e.g., by adapting the learning materials and giving game-based activities to students depending on their interest toward badges. In this work, we propose some metrics that provide information regarding the behavior of students with badges, including if they are intentionally earning them, the concentration for achieving them and their time efficiency. We validate these metrics by providing an extensive analysis of 291 different students interacting with a local instance of Khan Academy within our courses for freshmen at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

This research’s aim is to determine the approaches of preservice science teachers about physics that they have difficulty in understanding and physics problem solving that they have difficulty in solving through metaphors. The participants of the research are comprised of 139 students who are studying in different classes in the science teacher education program at the Faculty of Education at a university in the Eastern Black Sea Region. In the pattern of phenomenology, the data were collected through a questionnaire and have been subjected to content analysis by NVivo 11 program. Generated metaphors are generally grouped under the headings nature, benefits and needs. It has been found that the codes often emphasize the link between physics and daily life, difficulty, combining different kinds of knowledge and skills, and relation with logic. Some of the results reached are those: Even though preservice teachers associate physics and physics problems with life, they remember the solution process of routine physics problems when they face with a physics problem. They have difficulties in understanding physics and solving physics problems, and think that solving physics problems probably depends on combining information in a related way. Related to these results, suggestions such as giving different types of problems in physics lessons, gamification the physics teaching, adding a lesson about physics problem solving strategies have been offered. © 2020, Hacettepe University.

Past research demonstrates that serious games are prime candidates to utilise these principles, however the potential benefits of this approach for delivering drug education are yet to be examined in Australia, a country where drug education in schools is mandatory. Design and Methods: The serious game ‘Pure Rush’ was developed across three stages. First, formative consultation was conducted with 115 students (67% male, aged 15–17 years), followed by feasibility and acceptability testing of a prototype of the game (n = 25, 68% male). In the final stage, 281 students (62% female, aged 13–16 years) were randomly allocated to receive a lesson involving Pure Rush or an active control lesson. The lessons were compared in terms of learning outcomes, lesson engagement and future intentions to use illicit drugs. Results: Students enjoyed playing Pure Rush, found the game age-appropriate and the information useful to them. Both the Pure Rush and the active control were associated with significant knowledge increase from pre to post-test. Among females, multi-level mixed-effects regression showed knowledge gain was greater in the Pure Rush condition compared to control (β = 2.36, 95% confidence interval 0.36–4.38). There was no evidence of between condition differences in lesson engagement or future intentions to use illicit drugs. Discussion and Conclusions: Pure Rush is an innovative online drug education game that is well received by students and feasible to implement in schools.

Better patient education has been proposed to improve pain management of patients. Serious games have not been previously developed to help patients to learn how to manage their postoperative pain. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the development of a computer-based game for surgical patients to learn about postoperative pain management and to evaluate the usability, user experience, and efficacy of the game. Methods: A computer game was developed by an interdisciplinary team following a structured approach. The usability, user experience, and efficacy of the game were evaluated using self-reported questionnaires (AttrakDiff2, Postoperative Pain Management Game Survey, Patient Knowledge About Postoperative Pain Management questionnaire), semi-structured interviews, and direct observation in one session with 20 participants recruited from the general public via Facebook (mean age 48 [SD 14]; 11 women). Adjusted Barriers Questionnaire II and 3 questions on health literacy were used to collect background information. Results: Theories of self-care and adult learning, evidence for the educational needs of patients about pain management, and principles of gamification were used to develop the computer game. Ease of use and usefulness received a median score between 2.00 (IQR 1.00) and 5.00 (IQR 2.00) (possible scores 0-5; IQR, interquartile range), and ease of use was further confirmed by observation. Participants expressed satisfaction with this novel method of learning, despite some technological challenges. The attributes of the game, measured with AttrakDiff2, received a median score above 0 in all dimensions; highest for attraction (median 1.43, IQR 0.93) followed by pragmatic quality (median 1.31, IQR 1.04), hedonic quality interaction (median 1.00, IQR 1.04), and hedonic quality stimulation (median 0.57, IQR 0.68). Knowledge of pain medication and pain management strategies improved after playing the game (P=.001). Conclusions: A computer game can be an efficient method of learning about pain management; it has the potential to improve knowledge and is appreciated by users.

The problem of the study results from the contradiction between the broad potential of the gamification tools to motivate and involve students in modeling, to improve their skills, and the ideas of the general methodology about gamifying the educational process as well as the lack of well-designed techniques and methods of using the appropriate software to teach modeling at school. The purpose of the study is to define the didactic value of the gamification tools used to teach modeling at school and to develop a methodological approach to the structured lesson planning using computer game instruction technology. The article describes the types of schoolchildren activities, which allow the use of gamification tools for modeling, to develop schoolchildren's research skills and the ability to use modern tools to solve theoretical and experimental problems. It describes methodological methods and recommendations on organizing information and pedagogical interaction between the participants of the educational process by applying educational programs available on gaming platforms both at the level of personal communication between the teacher and the student, and at the level of the tripartite ""teacher-student-computer"" interaction. The results of the study can be used, firstly, to change the techniques and methods of teaching modeling at school; secondly, to improve conventional training programs included in the curriculum for university students of pedagogical departments and faculties; thirdly, to develop and improve specific educational programs in various subjects on the gaming platforms for schools in order to improve the quality of education, social integration, and career orientation. © 2018 by the authors.";"13058215";10;"Russia";"Scopus"

The use of different technologies, as well as gamification in the classroom, can help us to meet this goal. In this case, it is presented the use of two techniques, which are a digital escape room, using Genial.ly and a breakout, for learning algebra in the third course of secondary education. To carry out the experience, a comparison of the course 2018/2019 and the course 2019/2020 is made. Students of both courses completed an exam of algebraic fractions and then an equations exam; the exams were done in the course 2019/2020 taken after having used the techniques. The results show that there are low significant differences between both courses in the algebraic fractions exam qualifications, but those of the equations exam were significant, with a difference of almost two points, which led us to conclude that the use of this techniques improved the qualifications of students. Finally, the perception that students had of the experience was very positive, as shown by the data obtained and allowed them to improve their knowledge as well as their motivation and teamwork. © 2020 by the authors.

In Brazil, the digital textbook increased its market share with the Textbook National Program (PNLD, in Portuguese), that in 2014 inaugurated government shopping of textbooks with multimedia and interactive resources. In 2015, some criterial changes in the shopping conditions expanded the possibilities of digital textbooks in public schools. The results, however, are still shy in terms of pedagogical contribution and use of information and communication new technologies, with few academic contributions presents in textbooks and without extensive discussions about how teachers can use the material. Even in the private market, where there are different technological and financial constraints, the scenario is similar, as show this article that has focus on Sciences materials. From an editorial point of view, there are four factors related to these results: cost, time, technological limitations and development experience. This last topic involves not only planning objectives and didactic sequences, but also technological development and the relationship of the developer with the new digital technologies, in which is valuable the idea of natives and digital immigrants. However, some national and international initiatives are replacing the original digital textbook format - A ""PDF linked model"" where textbook and digital objects are clearly dissociated - with a ""embedded model"", that incorporates into the body of the text some multimedia interactive elements. The navigation and the visual appearance is enhanced with this proposal, but pedagogical questions remain typically relegated to the background, behind market issues. In the end, some trends and possibilities are presented to new generations of digital textbooks: digital social networks integrated, responsive statistical methods, eye-tracking technology and the inclusion of gamification in the digital textbook.";"1138414X";1;"Brazil";"Scopus"

Despite increasing academic research exploring the use of gamification in education little is known about teachers’ main drivers and barriers to using gamification in their courses. Using a phenomenology approach, 16 online structured interviews were conducted in order to explore the main drivers that encourage teachers serving in Higher Education institutions to using gamification in their courses. The main barriers that prevent teachers from using gamification were also analysed. Four main drivers (attention-motivation, entertainment, interactivity, and easiness to learn) and four main barriers (lack of resources, students’ apathy, subject fit, and classroom dynamics) were identified. Results suggest that teachers perceive the use of gamification both as beneficial but also as a potential risk for classroom atmosphere.

However, most studies use a one-size-fits-all approach to gamification, where individual differences and needs are ignored. In a previous study, we identified four types of students attending a gamified college course, characterized by different levels of performance, engagement and behavior. In this paper, we present a new experiment where we study what data best characterizes each of our student types and explore if this data can be used to predict a student's type early in the course. To this end, we used machine-learning algorithms to classify student data from one term and predict the students' type on another term. We identified two sets of relevant features that best describe our types, one containing only performance measurements and another also containing data regarding the students' gaming preferences. Results show that performance alone can be used to predict student type with 79 percent accuracy by midterm. However, its accuracy improves when paired with gaming data at earlier stages of the course. In this paper, we clearly describe our findings and discuss the lessons learned from this experiment. © 2016 IEEE.";"19391382";17;"Portugal";"Scopus"

Four weeks following T1, a follow-up assessment (T2) is completed by the participants, consisting of all questionnaire items to assess the stability of the intervention effects. Mixed-method analysis of covariance will be used to calculate the primary intervention effects (ie, physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake) while controlling for covariates, including family health climate, behavior-specific self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation. Results: This study is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and ethically approved by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. For both trials, it is hypothesized that the apps will positively influence physical activity and healthy eating in the whole family. Furthermore, SF2.0 is expected to produce stronger effects (ie, higher effect sizes) compared to SF. SF app development and piloting are completed. Data acquisition for the SF trial is terminated and discontinued due to the COVID-19 pandemic. SF2.0 app development and piloting are completed, while data acquisition is ongoing. Participant recruitment for the SF 2.0 trial started in February 2020. The results for SF are expected to be published in mid-2021, and the results of SF2.0 are expected to be published in mid-2022. Conclusions: In this study, it is hypothesized that targeting the whole family will facilitate behavior change at the individual level and the family level, as the implemented strategies address changes in daily family life. Furthermore, subsequent app development (SF2.0) with supplementary addition of motivation-enhancing features and a JITAI approach is expected to enhance positive intervention effects. © Kathrin Wunsch, Tobias Eckert, Janis Fiedler, Laura Cleven, Christina Niermann, Harald Reiterer, Britta Renner, Alexander Woll.";"19290748";3;"Germany";"Scopus"

Recent studies analyze the relationship between entrepreneurial attitude and different learning experiences. However, there is a lack of studies that relate entrepreneurship and business simulations with adopted gamification techniques. Moreover, even though some studies have been focused on management students at college and university level, entrepreneurial attitude in high school students has remained practically unnoticed for educational research. In this study, the entrepreneurial attitude of high school students is analyzed on the basis of the EAO (Entrepreneurship Attitude Orientation) scale through the participation of students on a gamified business simulation. Results have been obtained through a specific experience of gamified business simulation for students from different high schools of the province of Granada (Spain) in which near 1000 students from ages 16 to 18 that had taken basic business and economics subjects were involved over a gamified business simulation competition of 20 weeks. Results show that all EAO dimensions are positively affected by the gamified simulation experience except Personal Control. Thus, inclusion of this type of gamified simulation experiences in high school curricula is highly desirable to, among other positive effects; lower the psychological barriers related to self-esteem or lack of innovativeness that could inhibit individuals from becoming entrepreneurs. © 2016, Ministry Education and Science.

Within a Māori (indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand) worldview, genomic data obtained from taonga (treasured) species has whakapapa – generally defined as genealogy, whakapapa layers the contemporary, historical and mythological aspects of bioheritage – thus genomic data obtained from taonga species are taonga in their own right and are best studied using Māori principles. We contend it is the responsibility of researchers working with genomic data from taonga species to move beyond one-off Māori consultation toward building meaningful relationships with relevant Māori communities. Here, we reflect on our experience embedding Māori principles in genomics research as leaders of a BioHeritage National Science Challenge project entitled ‘Characterising adaptive variation in Aotearoa New Zealand’s terrestrial and freshwater biota’. We are co-developing a culturallyresponsive evidence-based position statement regarding the benefits and risks of prioritising adaptive potential to build resilience in threatened taonga species, including species destined for customary or commercial harvest. To achieve this, we co-developed a research programme with the local subtribe, Ngāi Tūāhuriri, that integrates Māori knowledge with emerging genomic technologies and extensive ecological data for two taonga species, kōwaro (Canterbury mudfish; Neochanna burrowsius) and kēkēwai (freshwater crayfish; Paranephrops zealandicus). The foundation of our research programme is an iterative decision-making framework that includes tissue sampling as well as data generation, storage and access. Beyond upholding the promises made in The Treaty of Waitangi, we contend the integration of Māori principles in genomics research will enhance the recovery of taonga species and enable the realisation of Māori values. © 2019 New Zealand Ecological Society.";"01106465";11;"New Zealand";"Scopus"

Many previous studies, however, focused on investigating user perceptions, while some experiment studies lacked control groups. Additionally, many studies in the higher education context focused on the discipline of Computer Science and Information Technology, and involved participants mainly in Europe or North America. In this paper, we report the effects of game mechanics on student cognitive and behavioral engagements through two experiment studies conducted in an Asian university. In Study 1, we employed a randomized experiment-control group design. The experiment group (n = 11) attended an education-related course on Designing Questionnaire that incorporated the use of game mechanics (points, badges, and leader board), as well as course activities informed by the Self-Determination theory of motivation. The control group (n = 11) attended the same course and activities taught by the same instructor but without the game mechanics. In a subsequent semester, we repeated the research with a larger cohort of students (Study 2) through a quasi-experiment design (n = 20 experiment, and n = 22 control group). The deployment of game mechanics produced greater student contribution in the discussion forums, but no significant difference on students' recall of factual knowledge. However, we found that the use of game mechanics had a positive effect on motivating students to engage with more difficult tasks, and that the quality of artifacts produced by participants in the experimental groups were higher than those in the control groups. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.";"03601315";96;"Hong Kong";"Scopus"

One pedagogical approach to help engage students involves the use of games. Educational games can provide students with a motivating and stimulating environment while providing them with immediate feedback to promote learning. Purpose: This systematic review examines research focused on the implementation of games to teach undergraduate engineering students; it summarizes prevailing features and cites examples from a variety of engineering disciplines. Scope/Method: The systematic review was conducted through a detailed search of Science Direct journals and the Scopus, Web of Science, Compendex/Inspec, and ERIC Education Research Abstract databases using terms pertinent to games in engineering education. A total of 191 papers was included after application of the inclusion/exclusion criteria. After screening those to determine if assessment of student learning outcomes was performed, 62 papers were found suitable for more detailed analysis. Conclusions: Research on the implementation of games in undergraduate engineering classrooms has shown that, despite diverse forms of assessment applied, there is a general trend that both student learning and attitudes are improved by game-based activities. However, since only a relatively small subset of the literature demonstrates a systematic, validated approach in assessment, significant opportunities remain for future research. © 2016 ASEE.";"10694730";84;"United States";"Scopus"

Nowhere else is this more important than in education. Considering the careful build-up and implementation of game-elements could improve academic performance outcome and student motivation. However, Gamification could require much more time to be designed and applied to education related activities and it also comes with significant operating and design cost to provide highly engaging activities for students. One of the main problems in designing Gamification is the question: “which game elements should be applied to student activities?”. Moreover one must make sure that it has great impact on students' performance in terms of their education related performance. Hence, in this research, we focused on studying the impact of each element in order to investigate the behavioral outcome of game elements in educational environments through the concept of knowledge and game-based learning from the Gamification concept. In our experiment, we examined the impact of each game element on senior high school students based on the basic elements of Gamification such as Leaderboard, Cooperative and Awarding badges. In addition, we studied the effect of the game-based learning application called Aqua Republica from UNEP and DHI centers with partner of Thailand. The experiment design compared two groups: the “Non-Gamified” and the “Gamified” groups participating in the game-based learning activity Aqua Republica. Academic indicators and numerical indicators were used to directly measure the effect and behavioral outcome of the use of game elements. Finally, the study suggested that leaderboards could improve the overall performance of students so it can be worth implementing it in classroom activities. © 2019 Kassel University Press GmbH.

In the organizational context, the Technology-Enhanced Training Effectiveness Model [TETEM] provides a framework to understand how technologies, like gamification, can effect change in various instructional outcomes. Specifically, application of TETEM suggests that gamification may not effect change in instructional outcomes when learner attitudes towards game-based learning and experience with video games are low. Method In this study, we test this model in the gamification context by assigning potential learners to read scenarios describing gamified instruction or traditional, PowerPoint instruction in a random order and assessing their training valence. Results On average, participants anticipated greater value from gamified instruction, but as predicted by TETEM, this effect was moderated by both video game experience and attitudes towards game-based learning. Among potential learners with high experience and attitudes, gamification produces better outcomes than PowerPoint, but among potential learners with low experience and attitudes, gamification produces worse outcomes than PowerPoint. Implications We provide empirical support for TETEM and conclude that for gamification to be successful, the attitudes and experience of participants must be assessed and ensured before gamification is implemented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd";"07475632";74;"United States";"Scopus"

Drive by Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study believes that motivational affordance resulted from gamification activity may lead to psychological outcome, and this psychological outcome will lead to behavioural outcome. Methodology: The study was conducted using qualitative action research methodology with descriptive analysis in two classes of Enterprise Strategy course. Three phases were involved for data gathering. Main Findings: In phase 1, when traditional lecture was solely used, students seemed to be passive, indifferent and reluctant to participate. In phase 2, when traditional lecture is supplanted with gamification activity, students have participated actively. Similar results of phase 2 was found in phase 3, where different set of students were observed. Students also perceived that using gamification in classroom provide enjoyable and fun environment, attractive and exciting, besides enhancing knowledge. Students also perceived that gamification activity increases participation, improving motivation, creating competition, developing teamwork and bonding between students and instructor and should be conducted more. Application: The results of this study may be beneficial to students in term of new technique used in teaching and learning process through enhancement of knowledge circulation from lecturers to students or between the students themselves. The results may also heighten the awareness of instructors in identifying alternative tools besides conducting traditional lectures. The results also may encourage administrators in helping the instructors towards upgrading their teaching methods and performance using latest applications for the purpose of improving students’ engagement.

It is recognised that patient safety and human factors' education is necessary for doctors to practice safely. Teaching patient safety to medical students is difficult. Institutions must develop expertise and build curricula while students must also be able to see the subject as relevant to future practice. Consequently graduates may lack confidence in this area. Method We used gamification (the application of game design principles to education) to create a patient safety simulation for medical students using game elements. Gamification builds motivation and engagement, whilst developing teamwork and communication. We designed an escape room - a team-based game where learners solve a series of clinical and communication-based tasks in order to treat a fictional patient while avoiding a € clinician error'. This is followed up with an after action review where students reflect on their experience and identify learning points. Outcome Students praised the session's interactivity and rated it highly for gaining new knowledge and skills and for increasing confidence to apply patient safety concepts to future work. Conclusion Our findings are in line with existing evidence demonstrating the success of experiential learning interventions for teaching patient safety to medical students. Where the escape room has potential to add value is the use of game elements to engage learners with the experience being recreated despite its simplicity as a simulation. More thorough evaluation of larger pilots is recommended to continue exploring the effectiveness of escape rooms as a teaching method. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

In this sense, teachers can find multitasking students that can perform many activities but without reflexively undertaking them. Education tries to solve these type of problems so the learning-teaching process is as significant as possible. Therefore, future teachers should always have tools for keeping students’ attention, as well as to raise interest in the studied subjects. Within these new tools, escape rooms are, because they not only increase students’ motivation but also encourage teamwork and reflexive learning, as the tasks to be solved are complex. However, as male and female present different perspectives towards gamification, in this work, escape rooms have been studied applying a gender perspective. In the University of Seville, Spain, a descriptive-interpretative exploratory study took place intending to analyse future female teachers’ conceptions about escape rooms. A 17-item questionnaire was applied to 99 female students of the Degree in Primary Education. Results show that subjects highly valued the ludic part of the escape rooms as a didactic activity, which fosters significant learning. Students also appreciated that the activity was close to their reality and that it was integrating students’ interests in the Primary Education classroom. The main conclusion of the study is that, even if there is room for improvement and there is a need to make them more appealing to female students, escape rooms are considered an excellent educative resource as well as an adequate alternative teaching methodology. © 2020, University of Wollongong.

Gamification is among the new training methodologies, which is a didactic approach based on the game structure with an attractive component for students. Within gamification, flipped learning and problem-based learning, escape rooms can be found as a technical aspect, which is focused on providing enigmas and tracks for the various educational content that students have assimilated through learning based on problem solving. The aim of this study is to identify how the use of gamification with the use of educational escape rooms affects activation and absence of a negative effect on students. 61 Master students of the Autonomous City of Ceuta participated in this case study. They were divided into three study groups (1 control group; 2 experimental groups) that followed different formative actions (control group—traditional; experimental groups—escape rooms). To achieve the objectives, a mixed research design based on quantitative and qualitative techniques was followed. The instrument used for data collection was the GAMEX (Gameful Experience Scale). The results reveal that the students who had taken a gamified formative action through escape rooms obtained better assessment results in the indicators concerning motivation, teamwork, commitment, activation, and absence of a negative effect on the learning process than those with the traditional methodology. © 2020 by the authors.

Coexistence in schools inevitably implies conflicts among peers, which can have a negative impact inboth the students' well-being and their academic achievement. In this sense, the main objective of the present article is to introduce and describe the evaluation of the Training Program in Emotional Management Happy 8-12. This software focuses on the education of the pupils' emotional competences in order to solve conflicts in an assertive way. The program consists of 25 conflicts which students need to solve according to the management program of emotions developed by the Psychopedagogic Orientation Group (GROP). Method. The sample of the study consisted of 574 students of 5th and 6th grade of primary education. 301 of the participants were boys (52.4%) and 273 were girls (47.6%). Average age was 10.53, with a standard deviation of.662. The design employed in the present work was a quasi experimental design with pretest and posttest with a control group. The instruments and techniques used for the evaluation were: QDE, STAIC, CES, playground climate, anecdotic registration of conflict behaviours and academic performance. Results. Our results indicated that Happy 8-12 significantly improved the emotional competences of the students, reduced anxiety levels, and ameliorated the atmosphere in both the playground and in the class, noticeably augmenting the academic success. Conclusión. The results of this study show that training the management of emotions improves students' well-being at the same time that it acts as a preventive strategy for more severe disruptive behaviours, such as bullying. It also optimises the coexistence in the educative centres. © Education & Psychology I+D+i and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (Spain).";"16995880";10;"Spain";"Scopus"

Two educational card games were previously developed to help students learn about factors affecting contrast and blackness as well as radiographic artifacts. Second-year veterinary students played one of the two card games as a part of their normal studies for their veterinary imaging course and later took the radiographic physics quiz normally administered during the course. Performance on quiz questions related to each of the two games was compared between students who played each respective game and those who did not. The hypothesis was that students who played a game would perform better on related questions than those who did not play that game. For the contrast and blackness questions, students who played the associated game as part of their studies performed better than those who only studied by conventional means (mean 4.3 vs. 3.8 out of 5 points, p = .02). However, there was no significant difference in results between groups for artifacts questions (mean 4.7 vs. 4.5 out of 5 points, p = .35).

An important premise of entrepreneurship education is that it can be learned and students can be taught to formulate entrepreneurial mentality, skills and competencies, something that can result in the formulation of startups and business initiatives. Given the importance of entrepreneurship, the necessity to formulate efficient entrepreneurship education frameworks and training programs arise. In this work, we present the design of an entrepreneurship educational environment that is based on learning in 3D virtual worlds. Innovative 3D virtual reality technologies were utilized to provide immersive and efficient learning activities. Various topics of entrepreneurship education courses were designed and formulated to offer students the opportunity to obtain theoretical knowledge of entrepreneurship. The 3D virtual reality educational environment utilizes pedagogical approaches that are based on gamification principles, allowing students to study in immersive ways as well as in game-based learning activities on real challenges that can be found in business environments. The game-based learning activities can help students gain necessary skills, helping them to tackle everyday obstacles on their entrepreneurial pathways. An experimental study was performed to explore the learning efficiency of the environment and the gamified learning activities as well as assess their learning impact on student's motivation, attitude, and overall learning experience. The evaluation study revealed that the framework offers efficient gamified learning activities that increase students' motivation and assist in the formulation of entrepreneurship mentality, skills and competencies. © 2019 by the authors.";"20711050";9;"Greece";"Scopus"

Educational games promote learning and enhance collaboration among nursing students. This pilot teaching strategy consisting of three simulation games was implemented in the first and fourth semester of an undergraduate baccalaureate nursing program. Traditionally, students learn in relatively stable environments such as laboratory settings. However, students' clinical experiences may include patients with high acuities and complex health issues. Nursing students express fear regarding attending clinical experiences. Methods: These gamified simulation scenarios were designed to have students experience the unexpected, to face their fears in a controlled environment. This unique design combined game elements with a simulation experience. Students' assessment was based on their knowledge of patient safety and the environment of care as reflected in our program outcomes based on Quality and Safety Education for Nurses competencies. The aim of this project, gamified simulations, was designed as an innovative teaching strategy to engage students and encourage reflective self-assessment of skills. Results: One hundred percent of the participants expressed that the learning experience was beneficial, engaging, and decreased their fears of the unexpected. All students expressed increased readiness for the clinical setting based on this experience. Conclusions: The gamification of patient safety simulation scenarios was found to be a creative innovation to increase student enthusiasm for learning and self-reflection.

This implementation of an educational escape room explored the feasibility of using a blended online/offline escape room activity in a large enrollment pharmacy management course. Educational activity and setting: An educational escape room activity based on a mixture of online and paper-based clues was designed and implemented in the human resources module of a third professional year pharmacy management course with 141 students. The proof of concept was assessed via an instructor post-activity feasibility analysis and a log of estimated time for all design, development, and delivery components. The instructional objectives of creating a fun, engaging, and collaborative method of teaching were evaluated through an anonymous online student survey. Findings: The blended environment escape room was implemented successfully. Student perceptions of the activity were generally very positive. In comparison with a typical classroom experience, 91% (n = 126) of participants indicated they were more engaged in thinking about the problems and 89% (n = 123) enjoyed the escape room more. With an instructional design that addresses logistical requirements, educational escape rooms can be conducted in courses with large enrollments. Time requirements for this type of teaching method are substantial, but reasonable, if the activity is repeated in subsequent semesters. Educational escape rooms can be used to provide a more enjoyable student experience that immerses them as active participants in the learning environment. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.";"18771297";35;"United States";"Scopus"

Scholars hold that migration can be considered as a switching of people's place of residence, but the migration of people is not limited to the migration of residence. The marketing field also borrows the population migration theory to further explore the switching behavior of customers; educationalists also discuss migration of learning through migration theory. In this regard, the migration of human beings is a process of historical evolution, though it takes several decades to understand history from the perspective of such evolution. Hence, if there is a decision-making system that simulates evolution and estimation through 3D graphics, then players may better understand the impact of environmental migration and changes on humanity. This study adopts Push-Pull-Mooring (PPM) theory to explain the migration of human beings. Push is generated from people's dissatisfaction with their place of residence, Pull is from attractions of the new environment, and personal mooring produces the intention of switching. A set of Gamification Environmental Education Applications (GEEA) and a migration scale for such apps are developed herein to explain the state where computer gamers switch to mobile app games. The results show that all four hypotheses are supported, and the path coefficient of each hypothesis is highly significant. The R2 values of five intrinsic constructs are Push (R2 = 0.321), Mooring (R2 = 0.574), Pull (R2 = 0.413), Switching intention (SI) (R2 = 0.552), and SB (R2 = 0.626), where the R2 value of SB is quite high, indicating that the relationship between the switching behavior (SB) and the four precursors exhibits great explanatory power. Hence, the explanatory power of this model is convincing, and the teaching materials designed through gamification education deliver better learning outcomes. © 2018 by the authors.";"20711050";12;"Taiwan";"Scopus"

However, the benefit and implementation of such gaming platforms are not clearly studied. This analysis assesses the feasibility of Kahoot! regarding simplicity and low-cost performance as a learning/teaching tool for medical education in (histo-)pathology. Materials and Methods: In this feasibility pilot study, we developed 36 modules for different benign and malignant tumors, covering four major topics: gastrointestinal tract, dermatology, urogenital tract, and hematology. Each module included histomorphological text-based questions for education of 2nd-year medical students. The online gaming-platform Kahoot! was anonymously implemented before and after “classical” medical education which included discussions of histological slides for each tumor entity using Microsoft PowerPoint-based presentations in combination with microscopical demonstrations. Participating students were invited to a seven-questions evaluation about the online educational approach. Results: Overall, 23 of 51 students of the study class completed the pre-and the post-evaluation of Kahoot! in one or more organ systems. The percentage of correct answers increased from the initial mean/median of 47.2/45% to 77.2/76.3%. Simultaneously, the time for answering questions decreased by roughly 50% (from mean/median time of 9.1/8.3 seconds to 5.1/4.3 seconds) from pre-to post-assessment. The results were independent of gender; however, there were scoring differences between the different organ systems. Students positively evaluated the routine implementation of the gaming-platform Kahoot! within medical education. Conclusion: Kahoot! is as a simple, direct, and low-cost application in medical teaching improving learning outcomes of pathomorphological topics with high acceptance by students.

The goal of the study is to conduct an experiment on the implementation of a flexible mobile application for studying the “macroeconomics” by students of economic specialties and to compare the results obtained with the selected control group. A total of 20 sophomores (10 each from two universities: Sechenov University, Department of Economics and Management; and Azerbaijan State Economic University, Department of Economic Theory) were offered to study the course in macroeconomics using a mobile application during the semester (from September to December 2019). Students were selected from two universities for the scientific objectivity and from the second year of the bachelor‘s degree, since “macroeconomics” is studied in the early courses, regardless of the further, specific economic direction of the student. Students did not attend lectures and practical classes with a teacher; all training was performed with the help of an application. A control group of the same specialty and year (also 20 people) was selected to confirm or contradict the effectiveness of such a mobile application. The control group students studied “macroeconomics” in the traditional way, namely attending lectures and practical classes with a teacher, during this semester. As a result of the experiment, the study group students liked training with the application. Meanwhile, 70% of the students would not like to have such training for all disciplines, permanently. But students supported studying using a special mobile app as a supplement to the main format of teaching. During the final examination, held by the traditional method (a written exam -answers to 4 open questions and 10 multiple choice questions), the following results were obtained. Students, who were using m-learning, on average, got higher results by 0.2 points, according to the overall assessment, a 5-grade scale, and separately according to the test results more by 2 correct answers than students with the traditional education. Thus, this can be explained since students using mobile app practiced material in a form of game or case, which helped them to immerse themselves more in the problem and to assimilate the material.

However, much more analysis is required about the success or failure of these initiatives in order to know if this new MOOCs paradigm is appropriate for different learning situations. This work aims at analyzing and reporting whether the introduction of MOOCs technology was good or not in a case study with the Khan Academy platform at our university with students in a remedial Physics course in engineering education.

Netland (2013), based on a study of production systems in 30 firms, considered that all production systems share the same principles and that these are similar to the Lean system's principles. From its beginnings, the Lean system has evolved and spread to all sectors, and, although it is not the objective of this contribution to explain the scope of Lean, we can confirm that the literature still has no agreed definition of Lean production and, in some way, the general purpose formulations of the concept diverge. However, it is clear that the roots of Lean production should be acquired by future engineers for them to become Lean Thinkers. Understanding and assimilating these concepts on the theoretical level can be complex and so adequate tools need to be employed. We aimed to do this through gamification with LEGO.&copy; Set.Gamification has evolved from activity based learning and is an innovative learning system designed to improve knowledge through experience. It is the process of adding games or game-like elements to something (such as a task) to encourage participation. The Lean Management concepts we worked with were (1) Production based on takt time, (2) Process synchronization, (3) Small lot production, (4) Waste elimination, (5) Setup time reduction, (6) Lead time reduction (7) Cross training, (8) Employee involvement, (9) 5S, (10) Standardized work, (11) Visual control and Management and (12) Supplier involvement. The experience consisted of building a small LEGO ©structure and designing a balanced production line. The main aim was for students to acquire knowledge from the experience by highlighting ways to improve the production system and avoid waste through better planning and by applying some Lean practices. The experience was a complete success in terms of student involvement, and enjoyed satisfactory results in terms of Lean concept acquisition. In Conclusions, we categorize which Lean concepts were more easily consolidated through the game and propose improvements for subsequent experiences. Although the students acquired high levels of the abovementioned concepts, there were four concepts that did not meet the learning objective: Production based on takt time, Small lot production, Setup time reduction and Cross training. The problem was students did not have a standard framework within which to solve the case and, while proposing the concept of creating an innovative production system was solid, the lack of a standard framework made it difficult to compare the different solutions presented by the students. We hope this teaching experience will encourage Production and Operation management lecturers to adapt their lessons to this fascinating new way of teaching management concepts.";"1132175X";NA;"Spain";"Scopus"

It has been enthusiastically employed in various fields such as web-based businesses, health, wellness, and has been widely researched in the field of education. While many of the pioneer studies revealed positive effects of gamification for learning, more inconclusive and even negative effects have been reported in subsequent research. It is also uncertain whether the positive outcomes are sustainable and not limited to just novelty effects. Studies in this field continue to mature and the thrust is to move beyond the preliminary and often vague question of “Does gamification work?” to more specific inquiries like “Why does gamification work?”, “What is gamification’s effect?” or “How to make gamification work?” In order for the knowledge gains from research studies to be synthesizable, there has been a call for gamification approaches to be based upon established psychological, behavioural or learning theories instead of ad hoc methods. This paper responds to this need by presenting a gamification framework that is based on the well-established motivational theory, the Self-Determination Theory (SDT). The SDT addresses motivation through the distinction of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. In order to foster authentic learning motivations, gamification should be designed to affect intrinsic motivation for the learning activity itself. This paper outlines how this can be achieved by strategically employing game dynamics and components to meet the psychological needs that support intrinsic motivation. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.";"18234690";2;"Malaysia";"Scopus"

Of the distinct techniques introduced in the literature to engage students, gamification, is likely the most widely explored and fruitful. Game elements that intrinsically motivate students, such as graphical feedback and game-thinking, reveal more reliable long-term positive effects, but those involve significant development effort. This paper proposes a game-based assessment environment for programming challenges, built on top of a specialized framework, in which students develop a program to control the player, henceforth called Software Agent (SA). During the coding phase, students can resort to the graphical feedback demonstrating how the game unfolds to improve their programs and complete the proposed tasks. This environment also promotes competition through competitive evaluation and tournaments among SAs, optionally organized at the end by the teacher. Moreover, the validation of the effectiveness of Asura in increasing undergraduate students’ motivation and, consequently, the practice of programming is reported. © 2020 by the authors.

By using mobile technology and benefiting from their features we can provide a pervasive learning without being restricted by time and space (Learning anywhere and anytime). GBL over the last decade has played an important role in increasing the motivation of the learner player through the integration of gamification into the learner's learning process. The combination of the two elements gave birth to a new concept of educational system called Ubiquitous Learning Game (ULG). Mobile technologies are very diverse and market demands push the continued development of new technologies and features that present a big challenge in time and development costs. On the other hand creating a nice game for different player profiles requires the addition of the learner's model in the design phase of the game.

As there appeared a lot of game-based teaching methods, the techniques called gamification as well as differences between them are reviewed because both of them are supposed to be similar in education of late. Another problem with games in education is that some scholars still do not differentiate properly between gamification and game-based learning. This misconception is reflected even in their recent scientific works where gamification sometimes is regarded as mere usage of games in learning process. According to researches, the impact of games on learning process is efficient in terms of developing vocabulary and speaking skills, improving foreign language acquisition, boosting motivation and engagement of students and creating opportunities to apply acquired knowledge in practice. Moreover, implementing games in class environment (depending on the type of the game used) enhances critical and logical thinking, problem solving, team work skills. Using various games in the learning process is particularly efficient for IT students, since it is related to their major. Another advantage of game-based learning is that it can be realized within the learning management system (LMS).

The two most relevant game approaches are “serious games” (games with a serious background) and “gamification” (the application of game-typical elements in nongame contexts). The term serious games is used to describe games that are used to convey serious content, such as health issues. Gamification uses game-design elements such as points, leaderboards, awards, profile design, and team events to increase motivation and performance, for example in learning environments. This narrative article examines the mode of action and study situation as well as the advantages and disadvantages of playful applications in prevention and health promotion and exemplifies some of these applications. Serious games and gamification show great potential in prevention and health promotion. Especially in the case of target groups that are difficult to reach and disinterested, a direct connection to their living environment can be established. The foundations for the effective use of playful approaches in the work and training of health professionals are their already high level of familiarity with the medium of games and that games directly address the basic psychological needs to increase motivation. © 2020, The Author(s).";"14369990";3;"Germany";"Scopus"

It has a serious impact on the child's personality, upbringing, education, socialization, development, and academic success from the preschool period to the university and beyond. In general, traditional teaching methods usually have a fixed learning structure which disables the child to be motivated, creative and innovative. Learners receive theoretical rather than practical instructions, which discourage them from keeping and recalling concepts and information more quickly. Moreover, traditional teaching usually lacks attracting the full attention of learners which decreases their interaction, engagement and investment in the content. Thus, the development of innovative approaches offering better education is an effective way to address this problem. On the other hand, recent researches in the fields of cognitive science and educational neuroscience show that play-based learning is a promising approach to use in early childhood education. Four key success factors for learning have been identified to strengthen children's skills, namely attention, active engagement, feedback, and consolidation. Thus, the proposed approach presents a digital play-based learning approach deploying serious games augmenting the pedagogical aspect of the Montessori approach. Our purpose is to improve children's skills in their early years education through play-based learning and gamification. It aims to provide children with a rich variety of serious gaming activities and challenging experiences in an interactive environment. We developed several serious games based on Montessori pedagogical principal and the four pillars of learning. For the evaluation, we have chosen a representative sample of children from rural regions. © 2020, ComSIS Consortium. All rights reserved.";"18200214";1;"Morocco";"Scopus"

Evidently, there are studies that show that the use of computer games in students can improve critical thinking skills. Therefore, a critical thinking game can be devised to help solve the above problems. Critical thinking games are built using the Digital Game Based Learning - Instructional Design method, paradigm that uses computer games as a way to deliver learning content and utilize gamification to attract end users and engage them to understand the intended content. Design of Digital Game-Based Learning consists of several stages that must be carried out, including analysis, design, development, quality assurance, implementation, and evaluation. This critical thinking training game is named Lulu’s Friend. Lulu’s Friend game only implements 3 critical thinking skills, namely interpretation, analysis, and conclusions.

It remains unclear, however, which app features are particularly effective and encourage sustained app usage. Behavior change techniques (BCTs) and gamification are promising approaches to improve user engagement. However, little is known about the frequency BCTs and gamification techniques (GTs) are actually used. This app review aims to provide an overview of BCTs and GTs in current diabetes management apps. Methods: Google’s Play Store was searched for applications using a broad search strategy (keyword: “diabetes”). We limited our research to freely available apps. A total of 56 apps matched the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in terms of the features they offer to support self-management. We used a taxonomy comprising 29 BCTs and 17 GTs to evaluate the applications. Two independent raters tested and evaluated each app. Results: Interrater agreement was high (ICC =.75 for BCTs; ICC =.90 for GTs). An average of 7.4 BCTs (SD = 3.1) and an average of 1.4 out of 17 GTs (SD = 1.6) were implemented in each app. Five out of 29 BCTs accounted for 55.8% of the BCTs identified in total. The GT most often identified was “feedback” and accounted for 50% of the GTs. Conclusions: The potential of BCTs and GTs in diabetes management apps has not been fully exploited yet. Only very restricted sets of BCTs and gamification features were implemented. Systematic research on the efficacy of specific BCTs and GTs is needed to provide further guidance for app design. © 2019 Diabetes Technology Society.";"19322968";7;"Germany";"Scopus"

It turned out to be a practical solution as it proved to be promoting an atmosphere that fosters friendship and loyalty, and these close-knit relationships motivate employees; align them to work much harder, cooperate and be supportive to each other. This is possible because every individual possesses diverse talents, weaknesses, communication skills, strengths, habits, and hence it is optimally balanced out. Gamification is a method to enhance employee engagement, behavioral change and motivation. Application of gamification is not limited to eCommerce business models, but can be applied to various other business models in the sectors like education, research, healthcare etc. So also, the human resource pooling is building and grouping of human resources for best use to improve the operational efficiency and reduce the costs. The human resource pooling can happen during fine tuning of a cultural fit, organization mergers, change in organization structure, technological changes and on acquiring new technology. In this study we have considered a group of 120 employees who were further divided to 6 functional groups, having 20 employees in each functional group. In this paper we report the outcome of application of gamification and resource pooling techniques and benefits in an eCommerce industry. © IAEME Publication";"09766502";1;"India";"Scopus"

We empirically investigate this by exploring the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation on the participation and performance of over 100 undergraduate students in an online gamified learning intervention. The paper makes a number of contributions. First, by synthesizing the literature the central concepts required for a learning intervention to be considered gamified are mapped and the development of an online gamified learning intervention is described. Second, the effect of gamification on learning outcomes is examined using a pre- and post-intervention survey. We find that gamified learning interventions have a positive impact on student learning. Third, our results show that while generally positive, the impact of gamified intervention*ns on student participation varies depending on whether the student is motivated intrinsically or extrinsically. These findings will be of practical interest to teaching and learning practitioners working in a range of educational contexts, and at all levels of education, who wish to increase student engagement and enhance learning. © 2014 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.";"10494820";158;"Ireland";"Scopus"

Scholars and practitioners in the field of education call for innovative ways of engaging youth-a reason why gamification has gained more attention in recent years. This paper aims at exploring the role of gamification in affecting pro-environmental behavioral change and searching for best practices for educational purposes. For that aim, pro-environmental gamification platforms are identified and analyzed by applying two different frameworks: the Octalysis Framework and the Climate Change Engagement through Games Framework. After scanning 181 cases, a final sample of six is analyzed and two of them are selected as best practices with higher potential to engage users in pro-environmental behavioral change: SaveOhno and JouleBug. Meaning, ownership, and social influence, as well as achievability, challenge, and credibility, are seen as core elements that can increase the success of gamification platforms. In conclusion, the more attributes are enclosed in the gamification design, the stronger physical and mental connections it builds up with participants. Insights from this study can help educators to select best practices and gamification designers to better influence behavioral change through game mechanics. © 2020 by the authors.

The first feature is feedback, which is expected to increase engagement, with personalized (“tailored”) feedback being more effective than generic feedback. The second feature is a session limit that was designed to prevent users from “binging” the game, because this could prevent deep learning. Results showed that generic feedback was more effective than tailored feedback, contrasting our expectations. The session limit, however, did prevent binging without reducing the overall number of sessions played.

This paper presents the design and deployment of a game conducted in parallel with two groups of the engineering course “operations research”. The game design is theoretically supported, and unlike literature, the game proposed has the main distinguishing features: (a) it is carried out in parallel with the standard course, where player participation is optional, with extrinsic motivators regarding the final grade, (b) it lasts the entire semester, and it was applied to different groups with the same instructor, (c) in addition to academic performance, it has other social relatedness desired outcomes, (d) it combines the use of specific game elements divided in three types of activities: Mastery, related to the core topics of the class, Institutional, related to the university life and community, and Teamwork activities; and (e) it uses a WhatsApp chat group as the common communication platform. The assessment is twofold: the effects on learning, measured in two indicators, failure rate and average grade; and the perception of the game itself.

However, learning accounting is perceived as unexciting and hard to understand especially for those who do not possess any accounting background. The purpose of this paper is to study how entrepreneurship and accounting knowledge can be applied in education using board game to cultivate understanding on these concepts as well as to stimulate critical thinking and problem solving skills. An experimental method was conducted in which an educational board game on merchandising topic was used in a class setting comprising of 49 non-accounting students as the participants. Data was collected through questionnaire surveys that were given prior and after the experiment and followed by an interview session. The results show that game-based accounting education aids in generating an interesting teaching and learning environment on business accounting course that focuses on student centred learning. Most respondents agreed that learning business accounting through game activity encouraged them to think critically as they play to complete the game tasks. T-test result shows that there were significant differences between the scores before the game activities and the scores after the game activities for critical thinking skill. With regards to the mean scores, critical thinking skill mean score had increased after playing the game. Furthermore, majority of the respondents agreed that using games help them to comprehend the business accounting knowledge better. This paper contributes to the existing literature of using games in business accounting and practically, it benefits in increasing the awareness on how educational games can be applied to nurture entrepreneurship and accounting education. © 2019, Allied Academies.";"10879595";1;"Malaysia";"Scopus"

The purpose of this study is to validate an electronic learning, or e-learning, concept featuring gamification elements, rapid case reading, and instant feedback. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. An e-learning concept was devised that offered game levels for the purpose of providing training in the detection of pneumothorax in 195 cases, with questions read in rapid succession and instant feedback provided for each case. The user's task was to locate the pneumothorax on chest radiographs and indicate its presence by clicking a mouse. The game level design included an entry test consisting of 15 cases, training levels with increasing difficulty that involved 150 cases, and a final test that including 30 cases (the 15 cases from the entry test plus 15 new cases). A total of 126 candidates were invited via e-mail to participate and were asked to complete a survey before and after playing the game, which is known as RapRad. The level of diagnostic confidence and the error rate before and after playing the game were compared using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS. Fifty-nine of 126 participants (47%) responded to the first survey and finished the game. Of these 59 participants, 29 (49%) responded to the second survey after completing the game. Diagnostic confidence in pneumothorax detection improved significantly, from a mean (± SD) score of 4.3 ± 2.1 on the entry test to a final score of 7.3 ± 2.1 (p < 0.01) after playing RapRad, with the score measured on a 10-point scale, with 10 denoting the highest possible score. Of the participants, 93% indicated that they would use the game for learning purposes again, and 87% indicated that they had fun using RapRad (7% had a neutral response and 6% had a negative response). The error rate (i.e., the number of failed attempts to answer a question correctly) significantly decreased from 39% for the entry test to 22% for the final test (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION. Our e-learning concept is capable of improving diagnostic confidence, reducing error rates in training pneumothorax detection, and offering fun in interaction with the platform. © 2020 American Roentgen Ray Society.";"0361803X";4;"Switzerland";"Scopus"

Game-based learning environments are designed to teach specific knowledge content and skill-based learning outcomes using game elements. One main reason for using game-based learning environments is to increase student motivation and engagement while teaching learning outcomes. Many of the game-based learning environments are designed so that students will reach maximum flow, which is defined as students being so completely immersed in that game that they do not notice that they are learning. These learning environments have been shown to improve many behaviour and cognitive learning outcomes. While game-based learning has many benefits, some educational researchers have indicated that it is often very costly to develop a complex game-based assessment to teach a few learning outcomes. Hence, in some cases it is more beneficial to approach the use of computer games in education using gamification. Copyright © 2020, IGI Global.";"21556849";1;"Canada";"Scopus"

However, by collaborating with schoolchildren, ideas to effectively promote health and learning in school can be identified. The purpose of this paper is to examine how a participatory approach can deepen the understanding of how schoolchildren relate to and use gamification as a tool to promote physical activity and learning. Design/methodology/approach: Inspired by the concept and process of empowerment and child participation, the methodological focus of this study was on consulting schoolchildren. During a two-month period, 18 schoolchildren (10-12 years old) participated in workshops to create game ideas that would motivate them to be physically active and learn in school. Findings: The phenomenological analysis resulted in one main theme, “Playing games for fun to be the best I can be.” This consisted of four themes with two sub-themes each. The findings offer insights on how to increase physical activity and health education opportunities using serious games in school. Originality/value: The knowledge gained provides gamification concepts and combinations of different technological applications to increase health and learning, as well as motivational aspects suggested by the schoolchildren.

Along with the indisputable advantages of this technology for the learning process, there are a number of difficulties in its implementation. The research problem is the search for ways to increase the efficiency of using the flipped classroom technology in the educational process. The methodological basis of the study included the main provisions of the system-activity approach, the essence of which lies in the fact that in the educational process, the central and system-forming factor is the activity and methods of its implementation. In accordance with this approach, a sequence of activities has been built for first-year university students, aimed at achieving the planned learning outcomes. The novelty of the study lies in the fact that the principles of gamification are applied within a certain pedagogical technology with the aim of forming cognitive functions that are in demand in modern society. The data of the pedagogical experiment on the described technology for organizing the educational process are presented by the example of studying the topic “Information Security”. Based on the results of the experiment, as well as data analysis using the χ2-Pearson criterion, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is proved both in terms of increasing the degree of formation of the relevant competencies and in terms of cognitive and personal development of students.

To test whether gamification could be used to engage low-motivation smokers, we conceptualized ""Take a Break"" - a 3-week technology-assisted challenge for smokers to compete in setting and achieving brief abstinence goals. Materials and Methods: In the feasibility study of the multi-technology Take a Break challenge, low-motivation smokers were given (1) daily motivational messages, (2) brief ""challenge quizzes"" related to smoking behaviors, (3) a telehealth call to personalize their abstinence goal for the challenge, (4) ""coping minigames"" to help manage cravings while attempting to achieve their brief abstinence goals, and (5) a leaderboard ""webApp,"" providing comparative feedback on smokers' participation, and allowing for competition. Heterogeneity of engagement was tracked. Results: All 41 smokers initially reported that they were not actively quitting. Over half were employed less than full time (51%), completed less than a 4-year college education (76%), and experienced financial stress (54%). No smokers opted out of the motivational messages, and mean proportion of response to the challenge quizzes was 0.88 (SD = 0.19). Half of the smokers reported using the ""coping minigames.""

Prior gamification research has yet to investigate the efficacy of using a choose-your-own-adventure style platform in the classroom. The purpose of this research is to explore the pedagogical value of that particular gamification method. Method/Design and Sample: Two independent studies using quantitative and qualitative data taken from three samples of marketing students at a large California university investigate the academic effectiveness, perceived helpfulness, and perceived enjoyment of a choose-your-own-adventure type game in the classroom via the open-source program Twine. Results: Results from Study 1 indicate marketing students take 23.8% less time while simultaneously scoring 10.2% higher on the module assessment when their lessons are gamified using Twine (vs. not gamified). Results from Study 2 suggest this particular gamification method also increases student engagement. Value to Marketing Educators: Given the findings of these two studies, the previously unstudied choose-your-own-adventure gamification platform is a recommended teaching method to augment marketing education as it not only increases student performance, but also student engagement. © 2019, Marketing Management Association.

In domains such as education, marketing and health, where gamification techniques are applied, user engagement in applications has increased. In these applications the protection of users' privacy is an important aspect to consider, due to the applications obtaining a record of the personal information of their users. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to identify if applications where gamification is applied do respect users' privacy. For the accomplishment of this aim, two main steps have been implemented. Since the main principle of gamification is the existence of game elements, the first step was to identify the set of game elements recorded in the literature that are commonly applied in various applications. Afterwards, an examination of the relationship between these elements and privacy requirements was implemented in order to identify which elements conflict with the privacy requirements leading to potential privacy violations and which elements do not. A conceptual model according to the results of this examination was designed, which presents how elements conflict with requirements. Based on the results, there are indeed game elements which can lead to privacy violations. The results of this work provide valuable guidance to software developers, especially during the design stages of gamified applications since it helps them to consider the protection of users' privacy in parallel from the early stages of the application development onwards. © 2019 by the authors.";"19995903";6;"Greece";"Scopus"

Thus, efforts such as educational interventions among high-risk populations, especially the youth, are key to increasing public awareness regarding leptospirosis. This paper presents the findings of a pilot study wherein an educational intervention using a gamification intervention method was used to determine changes in leptospirosis knowledge among youth. On this note, students from a public university in Seremban district, Malaysia, were recruited and were asked to complete questionnaires before and after gamification activities. Baseline and immediate post-intervention data on leptospirosis knowledge were obtained. The total knowledge score was calculated, and differences in the mean pre-and post-intervention knowledge score were determined. Of the total 185 questionnaires that were completed at baseline and immediately post-intervention, only 168 that belonged to respondents who had heard of leptospirosis were analysed in this paper. A significant increase in leptospirosis knowledge was observed for the students following health education by gamification (p < 0.01). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of an educational intervention using gamification in improving leptospirosis knowledge among youth and suggest that gamification could become an efficient tool to prevent the disease within university-age demographics. © 2019 by the authors.

This article intends to present the concept of Gamification as a multimodal alternative for education, considering it a relatively recent initiative. It is a phenomenon still in its infancy, lacking in more studies and discussions, but not less interesting, since it proposes a new approach to education and many other segments of contemporary human knowledge. Method. The research shows that in Higher Education, as in other areas, its use is still incipient, because the controversy surrounding the theme is still considerable, however, it joins efforts with other proposals of the same magnitude, in an attempt to sublimate some of the learning problems of the individuals, leading them to the engagement and motivation in the educational environment. It is not a revolution, or a proposal to abandon pre-existing concepts and procedures, but an attempt to compose with what already exists and to take advantage of the benefits of evolution through which humanity passes, so that learning becomes increasingly more natural in the eyes of individuals.

In order to gamify a course, some key rules must be followed. However, this increases the complexity of the course design as well as subsequent implementation. Therefore, in this study, a game procedure-based concept was incorporated into the gaming design. In addition, design samples from 3D software education were used to create an example-based learning (EBL) environment to lower the difficulty of gamification learning designs and maintain course appeal. Furthermore, the MOOCs platform was utilized to facilitate blended-based learning, which improved students’ learning satisfaction.

The attendance of a course on medical terminology is mandatory for human and dental medicine students in Germany. Students' prerequisites when entering the course are diverse and the key learning objectives are achieved to a varying degree. Methods: A new learning space, the ""TERMInator"", was developed at the University Medicine Greifswald to meet the medical students' individual learning needs better. The interactive e-learning course serves as a supplement to the seminars, lectures and tutorials to rehearse and practically apply the course contents at an individual pace. It uses gamification elements and is supplied via the learning platform Moodle. The TERMInator was pilot implemented in two consecutive winter terms (2018/19, 2019/20) and comprehensively evaluated based on the general course evaluations and an anonymous questionnaire covering aspects of content, layout and user friendliness of the TERMInator and questions concerning the students' learning preferences. Results: The TERMInator was rated very positively overall, which was also fed back to the lecturers during the classes. Students appreciate the new e-learning tool greatly and stress that the TERMInator should be further expanded. The handling of the TERMInator was considered to be very easy and, therefore, almost no training time was needed. The tasks were easy to understand and considered a good supplement to the seminar contents. The extent and quality of the images were seen rather critically. The students' learning strategies differ. Although e-learning options were generally rated as very important, student tutorials were considered by far the most important. Conclusions: Medical terminology classes are characterised by heterogeneous learning groups and a high workload within a short time, which can lead to major challenges for the teaching staff. Complementary gamified e-learning tools are promising in view of the students' different knowledge levels and changing learning behaviour.

Also, instructions about how to use an ohm-meter and how to configure an electronic spreadsheet to do basic statistics were given. In order to customize and enrich the class, some optional contents (usually in a video) were made available. The access to the experimental activities was constrained by approval in four graded quizzes. Every activity was acknowledged by virtual coins to be converted in benefits (extra time to run final examinations, permission to consult class appointments and the opportunity to re-discuss a mistake in the final examination) and points, to rank students (leaderboard). Forty-five students attended the gamified class. No control group was implemented because this study aimed to find a good design for a gamified class, not to compare traditional to active methodologies. The overall student acceptance was excellent, and they reported that gamification can be a more engaging methodology than traditional classes, further developing soft skills and academic knowledge. However, the time spent to run the gamified class must be arranged, reducing the time inside the classroom. The opportunity to perform the experiment was considered essential, and could not be substituted by videos or texts since new doubts and concerns are pointed out during the practice when the teacher is present.

An educational social-networking platform gathered information about the contributions of participants and about the social networks that were formed during the course. A gamification layer with three game elements (points, badges, and leaderboard) was then implemented in the online learning platform. Social network analysis (SNA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to analyze the differences between a treatment and a comparison group (N = 591 and N = 427), using a set of 20 variables for each participant which quantified contributions to the learning platform as well as position and influence in the social network. The results of SNA show that gamification influences the structure of the social network of the course. The results also suggest that the variables cluster similarly for each group and that the linear combination of variables called the first component (F1) is a good descriptor of students' work and position in the network.

The interface is designed to appeal to Pacific people, a population group with a higher risk of developing clinically significant behavioral problems than most other ethnic groups in New Zealand. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the opinions of parents and professionals about the acceptability, usability, and content of Play Kindly. Methods: We used qualitative and Pacific and Māori research methodologies. A total of five focus groups with 45 parents and 12 individual interviews with professionals were conducted. The five focus groups consisted of 2 pan-Pacific groups, 1 Māori group, 1 open group, and 1 group of young Pacific adults or prospective parents. The professionals were from a range of disciplines, and the majority had expertise in early childhood, parenting interventions, or research in this field. Results: Play Kindly appealed to both parents and professionals. Participants related to the scenarios, which were created in collaboration with a playwright and animator. Although most participants liked the Pacific feel, there was some disagreement about how culturally specific the app should be. A range of issues with usability and gamification techniques were highlighted, likely attributed to the low budget and lack of initial co-design with parents as well as professionals with specific expertise in parenting. A number of parents and professionals felt that the parenting strategies were overly simplified and did not take into account the context in which the behavior occurred. Professionals suggested narrowing the focus of the app to deliver two important parenting messages: playing with your child and positively reinforcing desired behaviors. Conclusions: Play Kindly is the first culturally adapted parenting app of its kind designed for Pacific parents and other New Zealanders with children 2-5 years of age. This app has potential in Pacific communities where there are limited culturally specific parenting resources.

Several campuses in Indonesia and abroad have already started the movement and integrate the colleges' data and provide a digital experience for the campus communities. In order to motivate the communities, in this case the students, to leverage IT tools and platforms to improve their learning experiences, utilizing gamification and mobile technologies are seen to be the suitable combinations. Gamification as a concept to enhance user participation is also gaining a lot of tractions in recent years, including in the higher education sector. Many researches have shown that gamification is effective to improve motivations in core learning activities, to push students to be more proactive in gaining knowledge. This research is conducted to integrate a new mobile application to the existing smart campus platform in Universitas Multimedia Nusantara, Indonesia, while also gamify several student routines and activities to enhance the campus experience. The system is built as a hybrid mobile application and evaluated for its user acceptance by analyzing its users' perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use which are derived from the technology acceptance model (TAM). Based on the feedbacks gathered from the users, the gamified system is perceived to be easy to use and useful to increase student's participation and to motivate the users to actively complete their campus routines. © 2018 Authors.";"2227524X";4;"Indonesia";"Scopus"

The few experiences reported hitherto mainly concentrate on fostering participation and engagement in the training intervention itself. By contrast, we believe that gamification of TPD can and should have a broader scope, helping to enhance teachers' motivation to apply newly acquired knowledge and approaches in their daily practice. Accordingly, we have sought to gamify an existing TPD environment called 4Ts, which encourages teachers to design collaborative learning activities for their students via a specific theoretic approach (4Ts). In this paper, we describe the selection and integration of gamification mechanics in 4Ts following an existing methodology that, while generic, has nonetheless proved useful for gamification in the education field. The paper illustrates both the methodology and the experience of gamifying 4Ts with a view to potential transferability to similar, educational contexts.";"18269745";1;"Italy";"Scopus"

Recently, digital gaming interventions delivered on computers or mobile devices have emerged as another way to promote safer sex behavior in a young population. Tailorin these computer-based interventions to their target population has been recognized to increase positive behavior outcomes. In this qualitative study, we investigated whether young female and male adults from two different cultural backgrounds (all living in Germany) would have different preferences and needs in relation to an educational game promoting safer sex. Materials and Methods: We conducted four semistructured focus group interviews comprising open-ended questions with male and female participants who had either a German or a Turkish background. In total, 20 individuals, aged between 18 and 22 years, from two socially diverse and ethnically mixed vocational schools in Germany participated. Results: Independent of cultural background and gender, participants preferred a real-world design with a first-person visual perspective over a fantasy-like third-person perspective. Furthermore, they preferred highly customizable avatars. All participants mentioned the importance of including an alcohol-intoxicated avatar and most participants wanted there to be additional information available about various safer sex approaches and about the use of different barrier protection methods. Males and females reported similar preferences for the design of an educational game promoting safer sex, with the only difference being exactly how the topic of having sexual intercourse should be addressed in the game. Males preferred a direct approach, whereas females had a preference for treating this subject more sympathetically. Conclusion: Educational games offer anonymity and can provide young people across different cultural backgrounds with gender-tailored opportunities to experiment with specific safer sex precautions in a nonthreatening virtual environment, free from unwanted parental control and peer monitoring. © 2016 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.";"2161783X";2;"Netherlands";"Scopus"

Here, the design and application of the participatory simulation game Global Sustainability Crossroads is described, based on a global state-of-the-art energy-economy-environment model, which creates a virtual scenario where the participants are confronted with the design of climate mitigation strategies as well as the social, economic, and environmental consequences of decisions. The novelty of the game rests on the global scope and the representation of the drivers of anthropogenic emissions within the MEDEAS-World model, combined with a participatory simulation group dynamic flexible enough to be adapted to a diversity of contexts and participants. The performance of 13 game workshops with ~420 players has shown it has a significant pedagogical potential: the game is able to generate discussions on crucial topics which are usually outside the public realm such as the relationship between economic growth and sustainability, the role of technology, how human desires are limited by biophysical constraints or the possibility of climate tipping points. © 2019 by the authors.";"20711050";4;"Spain";"Scopus"

Global populations live increasingly in urban landscapes, which creates an ‘extinction of experience’ when interacting with nature. In 2018, we facilitated 8 workshops with students aged 13 to 17 from two Maori immersion schools (Wharekura) to explore the application and implementation of a cultural monitoring framework. Although initial workshops demonstrated it was possible to apply the cultural monitoring method across ecosystems, the absence of basic ecological literacy was a significant challenge. We observed that uptake and understanding of basic environmental knowledge and ecological literacy increased markedly when we used gamification. We tested the potential of technology to enable pro-environmental behaviour and increase environmental literacy and indigenous knowledge to support student’s connection to the natural world. Over the duration of this study, we developed a basic New Zealand ecology game, called Eko. The game fuses basic ecological concepts with indigenous Maori knowledge to provide a holistic view of the environment. Our survey results show that 90% of the students found our game entertaining, while 65% reported new knowledge acquisition. Our research revealed that while ‘extinction of experience’ in this area is rising globally, technology can be used as a mechanism to facilitate an increase in ecological literacy, indigenous knowledge, and pro-environmental behaviours. Our challenge in reversing the disconnection between our youth and the natural world is to explore the void between environment, technology, and indigenous knowledge.

Methods: A situationally responsive agile methodology, Scrum, was used to develop a distributed simulation module using short 1-week iterations and continuous synchronous plus asynchronous communication including end users and IPC experts. The module contained content related to standard IPC precautions (including handwashing techniques) and was structured into 3 distinct sections related to donning, doffing, and hazard perception training. Outcome: Using Scrum methodology, we were able to link concepts applied to best practices in simulation-based medical education (deliberate practice, continuous feedback, self-assessment, and exposure to uncommon events), pedagogic principles related to adult learning (clear goals, contextual awareness, motivational features), and key learning outcomes regarding IPC, as a rapid response initiative to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Gamification approach has been used to map learning mechanics to enhance user engagement. Conclusions: The developed IPC module demonstrates how high-frequency, low-fidelity simulations can be rapidly designed using scrum-based agile methodology. Analytics incorporated into the tool can help demonstrate improved confidence and competence of health care workers who are treating patients within an Ebola virus disease outbreak region. These concepts could be used in a range of evolving disasters where rapid development and communication of key learning messages are required. © 2016 Society for Simulation in Healthcare.";"15592332";9;"United Kingdom";"Scopus"

It uses a mixed methods analysis consisting of the observation of teacher-student interaction and student motivation questionnaires to demonstrate the impact of this innovative teaching approach on both genders. The sample consisted of 55 students from a school in the Region of Murcia (28 girls and 27 boys) aged 13 to 17 (M = 14.29; SD = 0.875) from two courses in 2nd- and 3rd-year lower secondary education. The observational analysis of the teacher's performance and teacher-student interactions was conducted by recording ten sessions on video, coded with the Personal and Social Responsibility Observation (SORPS) instrument and recorded with the LINCE v.2.0 software. The THEME v.6 Edu. software was used to obtain the behavioural temporal patterns (t-patterns). The Secondary Education Motivation Scale (EME-S) was administered to analyse the students' self-determined motivation and the data were entered in the SPSS v.22.0 statistical program to perform the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The results showed a clear assignment of autonomy and responsibility to the participants in the teacher's behaviours which generated greater self-determined motivation among the students. In conclusion, the application of a programme based on hybridising the TPSR pedagogical model and gamification is effective in improving student levels of autonomy, responsibility and motivation. © Copyright Generalitat de Catalunya (INEFC).

People with hearing loss use sign language to communicate with others and to help them in their learning process. For this study, an interview and survey were conducted with teachers and students from SK Pendidikan Khas Melaka and few problems have been identified in the learning spectrum of children with hearing disability. They face difficulties in learning due to the lack of exposure about the correct sign language since young, difficulty in interpreting sign language in the conventional teaching material due to the nature of its static image contents, and hearing loss children are also usuallyless focused in the learning process and are easily distracted by their surroundings when the class is in session. To solve these problems, i-Sign is developed as a learning application that incorporates simple gamification in its development that could help hearing loss children to learn the alphabet and basic words of sign language. The use of gamification and multimedia elements provide a more interactive and fun learning environment for the students instead of using static contents, and are also used to direct students' attention to the learning activity making them more focused in the learning process. i-Sign was developed using the ADDIE model which includes the Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation phases. In the evaluation phase, a usability test was conducted on 8 children with hearing loss to test theacceptance of the user towards this application and 91.89% of the respondents found that the application meets their expectation of the application capability in terms of its effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction. This shows that gamification can be used as an alternativelearning material for hearing loss children and help expose the correct sign language to them.The application can also be used by the public that wants to learn about sign language. © UiTM Press.";"18237797";NA;"Malaysia";"Scopus"

Few patients persistently engage long-term to improve health outcomes, even when they are aware of the consequences of poor adherence. Despite the potential of mobile phone apps as a tool to manage medication adherence, there is still limited evidence of the impact of these innovative interventions. Real-world evidence can assist in minimizing this evidence gap. Objective: The objective of this study was to analyze the impact over time of a previously implemented digital therapeutic mobile app on medication adherence rates in adults with any chronic condition. Methods: A retrospective observational study was performed to assess the adherence rates of patients with any chronic condition using Perx Health, a digital therapeutic that uses multiple components within a mobile health app to improve medication adherence. These components include gamification, dosage reminders, incentives, educational components, and social community components. Adherence was measured through mobile direct observation of therapy (MDOT) over 3-month and 6-month time periods. Implementation adherence, defined as the percentage of doses in which the correct dose of a medication was taken, was assessed across the study periods, in addition to timing adherence or percentage of doses taken at the appropriate time (±1 hour). The Friedman test was used to compare differences in adherence rates over time. Results: We analyzed 243 and 130 patients who used the app for 3 months and 6 months, respectively. The average age of the 243 patients was 43.8 years (SD 15.5), and 156 (64.2%) were female. The most common medications prescribed were varenicline, rosuvastatin, and cholecalciferol. The median implementation adherence was 96.6% (IQR 82.1%-100%) over 3 months and 96.8% (IQR 87.1%-100%) over 6 months. Nonsignificant differences in adherence rates over time were observed in the 6-month analysis (Fr(2)=4.314, P=.505) and 3-month analysis (Fr(2)=0.635, P=.728). Similarly, the timing adherence analysis revealed stable trends with no significant changes over time. Conclusions: Retrospective analysis of users of a medication adherence management mobile app revealed a positive trend in maintaining optimal medication adherence over time. Mobile technology utilizing gamification, dosage reminders, incentives, education, and social community interventions appears to be a promising strategy to manage medication adherence in real practice. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

The experiment involved the students of two universities doing the elective course ""Do Better Your Leadership Skills Up"". Having been split up into two halves, the first part of the focus group used the traditional forms of educational process, while the second one additionally used the software like CogniFit, Lumosity, BrainHQ, NeuroNation, Brain Metrix, Eidetic, Fit Brains, BrainExer 2.0. At the entry stage, the pedagogic surveys had been used as well as the cognitive function test to study the cognitive capabilities of the focus group students. We used a multi method approach of combining the close-ended and open-ended questions to get the feedback and the above cognitive test to measure the output of the study. Quantitative methods had been used to analyze the data and such Covariance-based Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) software as SPSS AMOS had been applied to evaluate the results because cognitive function of a person includes sub-components of latent constructs. Textalyzer software had been used to process the students' responses to open-ended questions of the questionnaire for the most commonly used positive words in the texts, which helped us to identify broad categories of responses. Here, the most commonly used words we had distinguished were ""involvement"", ""improvement"", ""gamification"", ""motivation"", ""speed"", ""concentration"", ""memory"", ""current studies"", ""future job"". Then we distributed the answers by the frequency of the identified words. The responses, which fell under no category, had been analyzed manually. The experimentally obtained data shows that integration of the smart technology into traditional learning environment increases students' involvement by 23%, personal transformation by 18% and motivation by 17%. Our study proves that the convergent mode of instruction brings more benefits to the students in terms of fostering cognitive aspects of leadership competencies in the process of vocational training than the traditional mode. We found that the converged pedagogical mode enhances the collaboration and involvement of all the stakeholders of educational process. It makes students achieve the greatest personal satisfaction through enhanced self-esteem, efficiency gains, a sense of continuous personal achievement and enhanced autonomy and experimenting with their own learning strategies.

However, most of such students are facing a high entry barrier due to their comparatively weak theoretical knowledge bases. We design a teaching strategy of CUDA programming aiming at students in this category. Our strategy constitutes of two teaching methods. The first method leverages “concrete fading” theory of psychology. Under this method, students can intuitively and efficiently understand concepts of CUDA programming even if their theoretical knowledge bases are not sufficiently solid. The other method utilizes “self-determination” theory of psychology as well as gamification. We use this method to maintain the high concentration level of students.

Understanding of the impacts of large-scale human activities on communities, and how the natural world is being affected is arguably the largest area of research outside of the health sciences, and the two are intricately linked. Yet despite scientific consensus on human-induced climate change, many publics remain divided about its existence and impacts. More alarming still are the contradictory positions from leading governments around the world to address climate change. The most convincing scientific evidence is in vain if scientists fail to communicate key facts to policy makers or to the general public. Here, we investigate various “snakes” (pitfalls) and “ladders” (emerging opportunities) in science communication. Using the example of the “Global Change App,” we argue that science education apps may be a promising and underrated way forward to improve how information is communicated between scientists, students and citizens.

We conducted a randomized control trial of GBL and gamification experimental conditions. We made a comparison with traditional teaching as a control condition in order to establish differences between the three teaching conditions. The sexual health education topics were delivered in a masked fashion, 40-min a week for five weeks. A mixed-method research approach was uses to assess and analyze the results for 120 students from a secondary school in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. Students were divided into groups of 40 for each of the three teaching methods: GBL, gamification, and the control group (the traditional teaching method). The average post-test scores for GBL (Mean = 79.94, SD = 11.169) and gamification (Mean = 79.23, SD = 9.186) were significantly higher than the control group Mean = 51.93, SD = 18.705 (F (2, 117) = 54.75, p = 0.001). Overall, statistically significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) were found for the constructs of Motivation, Attitude, Knowledge, and Engagement (MAKE).

In this article, an approach based on the divide-and-conquer methodology is proposed to facilitate its learning. The proposed strategy is designed to sequentially explain and evaluate the different concepts involved in hypothesis testing, ensuring that a new concept is not presented until the previous one has been fully assimilated. The proposed approach, which contains several gamification elements (i.e., points or a leader-board), is implemented into an application via a modern game engine. The usefulness of the proposed approach was assessed in an experiment in which 89 first-year students enrolled in the Statistics course within the Industrial Engineering degree participated. Based on the results of a test aimed at evaluating the acquired knowledge, it was observed that students who used the developed application based on the proposed approach obtained statistically significant higher scores than those that attended a traditional class (p-value < 0.001), regardless of whether they used the learning tool before or after the traditional class. In addition, the responses provided by the students who participated in the study to a test of satisfaction showed their high satisfaction with the application and their interest in the promotion of these tools. However, despite the good results, they also considered that these learning tools should be considered as a complement to the master class rather than a replacement. © 2020 by the authors.

Two experimental websites, including a gamification incorporated website and a no-gamification incorporated website, are constructed. Users are recruited to use individual websites. After the website experience, task questions, system usability scale, online questionnaire and retrospective thinking aloud are applied to collect user feedback. The data analyses reveal that ‘gamification incorporated website’ could not promote the usability of websites, while learnability, pleasure, engagement and satisfaction are enhanced.

Findings from research carried out to date on the effectiveness of gamification in educational contexts can be summarised as cautiously optimistic. However, researchers warn that further and more nuanced research is needed. It is generally accepted that matching an individual's learning style with the appropriate form of an instructional intervention significantly impacts upon the performance of the student and his/her achievement of learning outcomes. It is also widely acknowledged that personality traits have a significant impact on academic achievement. Knowing how individual characteristics will impact on the experience of gamification will inform the effective design of gamified learning interventions and enable its effective integration into the learning environment. This research examines the impact that different learning styles and personality traits have on students'; (1) perceptions of, (2) engagement with and, (3) overall performance in a gamified learning intervention developed using a prediction market. The study evidences a range of responses to gamification based upon individual learning styles and personality traits. Findings suggest that individuals who are orientated towards active or global learning styles have a positive impression of gamification. Other results suggest that extraverted individuals like gamification, while conscientious individuals are less motivated by it. These findings have important implications for practitioners deploying gamification. The key conclusion is that, as a tool for influencing individuals and mediating learning behaviours, gamification must be investigated and deployed in a nuanced manner with due regard paid to issues such as individual learning styles and personality traits. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd";"03601315";92;"Ireland";"Scopus"

This increase in the popularity of digital games is mostly associated not only with the interesting designs of the digital games but also with the emotional satisfaction with these games. In recent years, this tendency towards digital games has led to the transfer of certain features of games to non-game contexts. The concept named gamification refers to the adaptation of game features to non-game contexts. Gamification has been in use in many areas in recent years. One of these areas is the field of education. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the effectiveness of elements of gamification in blended learning environments within the context of emotion, interest and online participation. In the study, the convergent parallel mixed design, which allowed explaining the quantitative and qualitative data in association with each other, was used. In this respect, the study was carried out with 63 university students (30 students in the experimental group and 33 students in the control group) in a period of 13 weeks. In the research process, the two groups of students were provided with the opportunity to experience the blended learning environment both on face-to-face basis and on online basis. The experimental group differed from the control group in terms of such gamification elements presented in face-to-face and online environments as being given directives, progress bar, badge, level, experience point, leaderboard, award, completion rate, activity completion, activity restriction and activity feedback. According to the data collected in the study, gamification elements used in blended learning environments have caused the participants to develop both positive and negative emotions. In addition, it was revealed that gamification was found interesting by the participants Moreover, it was seen that there was a significant difference between the times spent by the groups in terms of their participation in online environment in favor of the experimental group. In addition, it was found that award, competition, level, badge and restriction were influential on the students' participation in online environment. © 2018 Turkish Education Association.

They play an especially prominent role in higher education, where they are used to promote content knowledge as well as higher order cognitive skills and competencies such as communication, collaboration, or problem solving. Despite some known positive effects of serious games on learning, critical voices claim that the objectives of a specific game often do not match the learning objectives and that the games focus on entertaining much more than learning. Considering these arguments and some general guidelines of using games in (higher) education, we developed a game on typical chemical misconceptions based on the popular game “Activity©” using Participatory Action Research. The game was developed based on the contents of a seminar on misconceptions for pre-service teachers (M. Ed. students) in a northern German university. It covers seven content areas where misconceptions are most prevalent and therefore aims at contributing to pre-service teachers’ Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK). The students are supposed to draw or mime specific misconceptions. Initial trials in three university courses showed a very positive perception of the game. © 2020 by the authors.";"22277102";NA;"Germany";"Scopus"

However, using serious games within project management education is not well understood. The aim of this research is to investigate project management serious games in higher education: i) determine the extent of gamification in PMI-accredited project management programs, and ii) survey university students about their experiences playing project management serious games. Two separate mixed-method studies reveal insights about serious games in higher education and where innovations may be leveraged. Traditional statistics were used to analyze quantitative data, and coding was used to analyze the qualitative data. The results from a global survey of ten PMI-accredited university programs suggest that serious games are embryonic but promising.

In this article, after providing a historical overview of educational gamification, a novel methodology is proposed based on the use of one of these serious games, specifically the tool Quizizz. This online tool is open access and free, which encourages teachers to reproduce the proposed methodology for their subjects. The methodological proposal is based on three principles: (i) the use of virtual resources in education; (Ii) the effectiveness of collaborative learning; and (iii) the motivation that the gamification of the teaching-learning process awakens in students. The effectiveness of the methodology has been demonstrated by surveys to the students carried out before (pre-test) and after (post-test) an educational experience at two pre-university levels: Junior High School and High School. In the light of the results obtained, it has become evident that the proposed methodology favors: (i) the teaching-learning process, by raising the level of student engagement in the study of the subject; (ii) the resolution of multiple-choice tests with a more optimistic approach and self-confidence; (iii) students’ greater predisposition for team work; and (iv) an entertaining and motivating educational environment. © 2019 Grupo de Investigacion FORCE.

This study investigates whether the use of ERPsim games can be extended to other management disciplines. More specifically, this study reports on using the ERPsim games innovatively in a new context, in an undergraduate managerial decision making course, to enhance student perceived learning outcomes and satisfaction. Background In this study, the ERPsim games were used to provide students with practical experience about using information in tactical and operational decision mak-ing and to illustrate important course concepts such as anchoring, bias, and bounded awareness, among others. The theoretical framework leveraged in this study was derived from the literature on technology acceptance in educa-tional settings and the studies on virtual learning environment effectiveness. Methodology Survey methodology was used to collect the data and test the research model. One sample t-tests and partial least squares (PLS) were used for empirical analysis. 138 students participated in the study. Contribution By developing and testing a sound research model, we conclude that the use of ERPsim games can be successfully extended from their current domain of Information Systems to management courses that are not technical to en-hance student understanding of managerial concepts in a fun and enjoyable way while enabling students to gain realistic practical experience in using in-formation for decision making. While, the ERPsim games have been used in IS education; this paper presents an opportunity to use them in a different context. Findings The study confirms that the ERPsim games are useful in improving student perceived learning outcomes and the level of satisfaction in management courses. It also identifies the factors that directly or indirectly shape student learning outcomes and satisfaction in such courses. Recommendations for Practitioners The use of the simulations has relevance to the new Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) guidelines that emphasize the need to incorporate evidence based, technology and data-driven decision making to solve real-world business problems into business curriculum. The study should also encourage educators to innovate in their own courses by experi-menting with this particular simulation or similar simulations. Recommendations for Researchers Researchers should use additional samples to increase the generalizability of the findings. They should also extend the current research model by incorpo-rating additional factors. Impact on Society The study provides support for the use of a simulation game to improve stu-dents' learning experiences and to help them better understand managerial decision making, which would allow graduates to more effectively transition into managerial roles. Future Research Future research should include establishing and validating the best practices surrounding the use of these simulations in the classroom. © 2020 Informing Science Institute.";"15479714";1;"United States";"Scopus"

This research is a case study and data was collected through a structured interview with 27 instructors. According to the content analysis, four themes were revealed as instructor-learner interactions: engagement and motivation, gamification, and instruction process. In the robotics instruction process, the teacher-student interactions were instructor guidance, playing with robots, and asking questions. Instructors state that positive influences on engagement and motivation were due to the instructors encouraging their students to work towards a goal, the robots’ moving, reinforcements, and including short breaks throughout the process. Moreover, it was emphasized that the scenario should be short, appropriate with students’ characteristics, interesting and relatable to the real-world. Instructors state that through the robotics instruction process, providing a game and an entertainment environment, it allows students to develop their imagination and to create their own products. In conclusion, it is revealed that robotics instruction process is enjoyable and effective for students, the creative spiral instructional model is a suitable and effective method, and gamification strategies make the process enjoyable by increasing the level of attention and motivation of students.

The use of games for serious purposes is strategy that dates back to the beginning of humankind. Objectives: The following article will outline the evolutionary lines of Serious Games, starting with the first traces of games in human history up to the present. In-depth consideration of factors influencing the development of Serious Games in the past and present outline possible future developments and may lead to a better understanding of today’s developments. Materials and methods: The present work is a narrative review and outlines the most important developments of games. The development of Serious Games for Health will be considered in more detail. The various influencing factors from the entertainment and military sectors are outlined as well as new technologies that change the use of games for serious purposes. Results: The development of Serious Games in the history of humankind is shown in a timeline. Games with a serious intention have been part of the culture since the beginning of humanity. Serious Games is not a new technology trigger, but has always been closely linked to learning. Various factors influencing the development of Serious Games have led to a very diverse, interprofessional and interdisciplinary field of research and application. Conclusions: Serious Games (for Health) and playful applications like gamification offer great potential for work in prevention, health promotion, medicine and health education. Due to the widespread use of the medium of play as an integral aspect of everyday life and culture, the achievement of hard-to-reach groups through this type of medium is very well possible. Aspects such as immersion, flow, storytelling and high interactivity and direct feedback make games an effective intervention strategy. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland, ein Teil von Springer Nature.";"18616755";3;"Germany";"Scopus"

Serious games are effective and innovative digital tools for educating patients about positive health behaviors. There are limited systematic reviews that examine the prevalence of serious games that incorporate medication use. Objective: This systematic review aimed to identify (1) serious games intended to educate patients about medication adherence, education, and safety; (2) types of theoretical frameworks used to develop serious games for medication use; and (3) sampling frames for evaluating serious games on medication use. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for literature about medication-based serious games for patients. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed for article selection. Results: Using PRISMA guidelines, 953 publications and 749 unique titles were identified from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. A total of 16 studies featuring 12 unique serious games were included with components of medication adherence, education, and safety, published from 2003 to 2019. Of the 12 games included, eight serious games were tested in adolescents, three games were tested in young adults, and one game was tested in adults. Most studies (n=11) used small sample sizes to test the usability of serious games. Theoretical frameworks identified in the 12 serious games included information, motivation, and behavior theory; social cognitive theory; precede-proceed model; middle-range theory of chronic illness; adult learning theory; experiential learning theory; and the theory of reasoned action. Existing reviews explore serious games focused on the management of specific disease states, such as HIV, diabetes, and asthma, and on the positive impact of serious game education in each respective disease state. Although other reviews target broad topics such as health care gamification and serious games to educate health care workers, no reviews focus solely on medication use. Serious games were mainly focused on improving adherence, whereas medication safety was not widely explored. Little is known about the efficacy and usability of medication-focused serious games often because of small and nonrepresentative sample sizes, which limit the generalizability of existing studies. Conclusions: Limited studies exist on serious games for health that incorporate medication use. The findings from these studies focus on developing and testing serious games that teach patients about medication use and safety. Many of these studies do not apply a theoretical framework in the design and assessment of these games. In the future, serious game effectiveness could be improved by increasing study sample size and diversity of study participants, so that the results are generalizable to broader populations. Serious games should describe the extent of theoretical framework incorporated into game design and evaluate success by testing the player’s retention of learning objectives. © Olufunmilola Abraham.";"22919279";5;"United States";"Scopus"

This instructional approach is appealing because it can free up class time for knowledge application activities with help from the instructor and peers. However, its implementation can be fraught with challenges. Student disengagement in out-of-class activities, for example, is one of the major challenges of flipped learning. The purpose of this study is to examine whether gamification can enhance student engagement in a flipped course. A comparison study was conducted, involving two classes of undergraduate students in an Information Management course. The results indicated that students in the gamification-enhanced flipped learning group (n = 48) were more likely to complete the pre-class and post-class activities on time than those in the non-gamified flipped learning group (n = 48). Students in the gamification-enhanced flipped learning group also produced higher quality artifacts than the non-gamified flipped learning group in the pre-class thinking activities.

Serious Games (SGs) are a tool with an immensely positive impact and great success. SGs enable learning and provide entertainment and self-empowerment, which motivates students. The development of an SG consists of complex processes requiring multi-disciplinary knowledge in multiple domains, including knowing the learning domain and adding the appropriate game mechanics to foster high intrinsic motivation and positive player experience that makes the players feel like they are having fun while learning. Otherwise, the game is viewed as boring and not as a fun and engaging activity. Nevertheless, despite their potential, the application of SGs in education has been limited in terms of pedagogy. Several authors assert that this lack is because SG standards and guidelines have not been developed. There is an imbalance between experts’ contributions to education and game design specialists for the SG development. Not all the SGs that have been developed have applied appropriate design methodologies that incorporate both the entertainment mechanics and the serious component. To ensure that an SG meets the user’s expectations, it must be designed using an appropriate method. This work aims to present iPlus, a methodology for designing SGs based on a participatory, flexible, and user-centered approach.

The results show that there is a negative correlation between the numerical scores of the different components of the evaluation and the marks obtained in the activities of gamification. It is surprising that the group less involved in the gamification obtained better academic results, although gamification improved the motivation and the valuations of the subject, due to the inclusion of more games in the course. This raises doubts on whether the positive effects of gamification on the climate of the classroom and on motivation are opposed to academic results. © 2020 by the authors.

Based on scientific evidence, five common practice aspects to reflect upon in our field have been proposed: (1) Misunderstood gamification; (2) indiscriminate use of APPs: (3) poorly focused cooperative learning; (4) true motivation; and (5) evidences of students’ learnings. Different practical solutions based on the use of formative and shared evaluation and the cross-sectional use of the body were proposed. Finally, considerations were presented as a conclusion; however, they are intended to offer any formulae, but rather scientifically supported reflections aiming at contributing to the enhancement of Physical Education. © Copyright: Federación Española de Asociaciones de Docentes de Educación Física (FEADEF)";"15791726";13;"Spain";"Scopus"

This uncertain environment does not foster student effort and it is behind the important rates of abandon in higher education. The Bologna Process was thought to create a new paradigm in higher education in the European Union. However, the changes came from the top (governments) to the bottom (lectures and students) so they were not properly supported by specialized training oriented to lecturers. It did not include the appropriate changes in lower education stages (secondary education) to prepare student when facing University. Therefore, in the past decade several new teaching methodologies have appeared to deal with student demotivation and to fight against dropouts. Those methodologies try to keep the students engaged during the whole course paying more attention to their learning process, attitudes, motivations and expectations. Consequently, in this paper, we present a four-year experiment whose main objective is to keep students engaged during the whole year and to foster their motivation in order to increase their learning outcomes. The experiment is based on the application of gamification to the assessment process emulating a traditional platform video-game, like Super Mario. The results show that this experiment was positive for most students who achieved good marks and good rates of task completion. © 2020 Royal Society of Chemistry.

This work presents a gamification experience within prospective primary teachers in a General Science Classroom. A scoring game-based methodology was used for teaching Matter and Energy contents. In an effort for promoting collaborative dynamics rather than competitive ones in the entire group, a new variable was introduced once the game was started. It was called Game-Index and took into account the scoring of the whole class, similarly to H-Index.

With the growing push for creativity in the classroom as well as the application of effective technology in teaching and learning, it can be a daunting task for educators to find fitting competitive or game-based learning platforms. Foremost, educators need to consider elements such as motivation and whether the platform is likely to foster and reinforce learning. In the present study, a cohort of undergraduates at a public university in Malaysia were exposed to the use of Kahoot!, a game-based learning platform, during their weekly lectures for one semester. The participants were students of English for the Media, which covers theoretical and practical dimensions. The latter dimension includes the learning and application of media language features and devices. Survey data (51 respondents) on the whole, indicated that the students found Kahoot! to be beneficial in terms of: 1) inducing motivation as well as engagement, and 2) fostering and reinforcing learning (for both theoretical and practical aspects). The 33-item questionnaire created by the researchers was also tested for reliability, with returned values indicating high internal consistency, thus making the instrument a reliable option for use in future studies.

Although some might still believe in the traditional method such as rote learning, the nature of the current alpha gen who are more prone towards the integration of technology caused many of the believers to have second thoughts about it. Besides that, the conventional classroom might not be entertaining and fun anymore as they are exposed to mobile phones and laptops daily, they require lessons that require them to move around, engage and do a lot of hands-on activities. Though it is not the central end of English language acquisition, teachers are still concern of how they get to assess their learners’ comprehension on the subject matter effectively. Irregular verbs is one of the greatest challenge in second language learning as it involved functioning brute memory. Hence, the main issue at hand is how to activate the brute memory if there’s no active engagement within the learners during the learning process?This led to another question on what can teachers do to make their learners motivated, engaged and actively involved in the learning process.As we are looking forward to find the solution to this matter, this paper is aimed to explore the benefits of using Kahoot!

However, an open research problem is discovering the set of gamification features that consistently result in a higher probability of success for a given task, game or application. The objective of this paper is to bridge this knowledge gap by quantifying the gamification features that are consistently found in successful applications. Knowledge gained from this work will inform designers about the gamification features that lead to higher chances of an application's success, and the gamification features that do not significantly impact the success of an application. The case study presented in this work leverages demographic heterogeneity and scale of applications existing within mobile platforms to evaluate the impact of gamification features on the success or failure of those applications.

This raises to surface what many studies have addressed earlier; creating a platform that completes the traditional classroom work and maximizes the effectiveness of learning outcomes. Striving to achieve such platform, studies have considered gamifying and personalizing the educational resources for the adaptation of educational systems as per the intended learners through intensive learning analytics. But was the learner really a part of the adaptation process taking place? Learning analytics are usually designed to the course’s adaptation and solely for the teachers. Thus, learning analytics in gamified adaptive educational systems involving the course, teachers and learners together are still under investigation. In this study, the Personalized Adaptive Gamified E-learning (PAGE) model is introduced to extend MOOCs by providing new satisfactory levels of learning analytics and visualization in the rich e-learning process that supports the learner’s intervention in the resultant learning analytics. The proposed Learning analytics have been developed to make the necessary adaptation to the course and learner’s learning flow, as well as visualizing the process and adaptation decisions to the learners. Results show a positive potential towards learning adaptation and visualization, and a necessity to provide an additional focus for the gamification concept. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Background Mobile devices and applications, which have become an integral part of our lives, are used for different purposes, including educational objectives. Among others, they are used in the process of foreign language acquisition. The use of a MALL application to learn foreign languages has advantages and drawbacks, which are important to understand, in order to achieve better learning results, while improving the enjoyment of the process. Methodology The study population included people who participated in a foreign language course and used Duolingo application on a mobile device in parallel. One group consisted of high school pupils, who were obliged to use the application and filled in before and after questionnaires. The other group consisted of people who took face-to-face courses, and chose to use the same Duolingo application voluntarily, in order to assist their studies. The second group answered another questionnaire tailored to more experienced users. The findings were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 22, and a model was examined with Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. Contribution This paper helps to understand the perceived advantages and drawbacks of us-ing a MALL application by students both in mandatory and voluntary environ-ments. Findings Most of the participants found the MALL Duolingo application enhanced the learning process. The gamification characteristics, ease of use, ubiquity and self-learning facilities had a stimulating effect on the process of learning, and con-tributed to the willingness to continue using the application and to recommend it to others. However, some statistically significant differences were found be-tween the groups, referring to the characteristics of the application, among them ubiquity, lack of human feedback and simplicity of use. Recommendations for Practitioners The research findings can contribute to both teachers and students who con-duct and participate in foreign language courses, by helping them examine the possibility of combining mobile learning with a traditional face-to-face course. Moreover, the findings can assist developers of mobile learning applications, in order to include gamification options in the process of learning. Recommendation for Researchers Researchers in the fields of mobile applications and m-learning need to under-stand the factors enhancing the learning process, in order to develop the next generations of m-learning applications.

It is generally agreed that by adding something fun to the learning process students become more engaged and, consequently, retain more knowledge. However, although the characteristics of video games facilitate the dynamics of the educational process it is necessary to plan a pedagogical project that includes delimitation of learning goals and profile of the addressees, the conditions of application of the educational project, and the methodologies of evaluation of the learning progress. This is how we can make a real difference between gamification and video game based learning. The paper addresses the design of an educational resource for special education needs (SEN) students that aims to help teach communicative skills related to prosody. The technological choices made to support the pedagogic issues that underlie the educational product, the strategies to convert learning content into playful material, and the methodology to obtain measures of its playability and effectiveness are described.

"612";"Learning takaful through gamification";211;"Seman J.A., Ahmad N., Malimc N.A.K.,";2020;"Article";"Journal of Critical Reviews";"English";"Gamification; Islamic Economics; Islamic Insurance; Takaful";"Gamification has turned out to be a new normal in technological advancements for human interaction. In the educational sector, this technique seems to be very promising to support and retain engagement with learners. However, while the volume of gaming elements on learning activities has increased, it is perhaps surprising that very little is known about its implementation in takaful (i.e, Islamic insurance) education. Building on recent papers on effectively gamifying a concept, this paper develops a game-based activity in understanding and creating awareness on takaful. Using the five-step process to develop gamification, this paper attempts to fill the gap by proposing a game-based activity using wordoku and other interesting elements to enhance learners' cognitive, behavioral and psychological aspects. Inspired by the Japanese mathematics puzzle Sudoku, wordoku uses letters instead of numbers to solve the puzzles. In this game, students need to complete all the five interactive parts which include completing wordoku, construction of a short-based story-line, drawing of a concrete shape poem using Jawi letters, sharing information using an online platform and finally creating a new wordoku. Aimed to be a built-in instructor, this game helps students to understand takaful and its role in Islamic economics. While it is acknowledged that further improvement is required, this study provides a basis for adopting gamification in takaful lessons. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt. Ltd.

Basing on personal experience, the authors of the article present the possibilities of organizing a Russian language lesson in the form of a quest. Many experts rightly paid attention to the effectiveness of using games in the learning process. Despite the attractiveness for teachers and students, until recently, game approaches as a form of education have remained on the periphery of the educational process, being just a supplement to the main methods. Only role-playing games can be called an exception, with their being included both in the educational process of school and university education, and in professional-oriented training of specialists. However, under the influence of processes in modern culture and the active development of gaming technology, the ""gamification"" of education acquires the character of a mass phenomenon both at school and in higher educational institutions, and ignoring these processes is not only impossible but impractical. In this regard, the article provides a scientific and methodological understanding of this form of education and identifies the structural peculiarities of the quest unlike the other game forms. The article is addressed to teachers of Russian as a foreign language and can be used as a kind of model for conducting quests in classes both in various courses on grammar, reading, writing, listening, linguistic and cultural studies, and in students' independent educational activities. © 2019, Sciedu Press.

The goal of this study was to evaluate gamification methodology as compared with other existing methodologies when teaching cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to secondary school students. Methods 489 secondary school students from two high schools in Spain participated in this randomised-block quasi-experimental study in February 2018. The students were classified into different groups. Each group received CPR training with a different methodology: GAM (gamification-based training as a compulsory but non-tested academic activity to learn by playing in teams, with instructor and visual feedback); EVA (training based on subsequent evaluation as a motivational incentive, with instructor and visual feedback); VFC (visual feedback complementary, training based on a non-compulsory and non-tested academic activity, with instructor and visual feedback); TC (traditional complementary, training based on a non-compulsory and non-tested academic activity, with instructor feedback). After a week, each student performed a 2 min hands-only CPR test and quality of CPR was assessed. Visual feedback in training and CPR variables in test were provided by the QCPR Instructor App using a Little Anne manikin, both from Laerdal (Norway). Results GAM (89.56%; 95% CI 86.71 to 92.42) methodology resulted in significantly higher scores for CPR quality than VFC and TC (81.96%; 95% CI 78.04% to 85.88% and 64.11%; 95% CI 58.23 to 69.99). GAM (61.77%; 95% CI 56.09 to 67.45) methodology also resulted in significantly higher scores for correct rate than VFC and TC (48.41%; 95% CI 41.15% to 55.67% and 17.28%; 95% CI 10.94 to 23.62). 93.4% of GAM methodology participants obtained >50 mm of compression mean depth which was a significantly higher proportion than among students in VFC and TC (78.0% and 71.9%). No differences between GAM and EVA were found. A confidence level of 95% has been assigned to all values. Conclusions GAM methodology resulted in higher CPR quality than non-tested methods of academic training with instructor feedback or visual feedback.

RERCs customarily convene an SOS conference toward the end of their five-year funding cycle in order to assess the current state and identify potential future research, development, and knowledge translation efforts needed to advance their field. The first two sessions focused on the current and future state of information and communication technology (ICT) for mobile health (mHealth) and mobile rehabilitation (mRehab). The third session was a wide‐ranging discussion of pressing needs for future research and development in the field. Several “big ideas” resulted from the discussion among participants in the SOS Conference that should inform the structure and operation of future efforts, including: (1) identifying active ingredients of interventions, (2) incorporating effective behavior‐change techniques into all interventions, (3) including measures of social determinants of health in evaluation studies, (4) incorporating user‐customizable features into technology solutions, and (5) ensuring “discoverability” of research and development outputs by stakeholders via structured and continuous outreach, education and training. Substantive areas of work include gaming and esports, the gamification of interventions for health and fitness, the cultivation of community supports, and continuous outreach and education wherever a person with a disability may live. © 2019 by the authors.

The consequences of the use of games for learning are not sufficiently investigated yet, although it is known that using games for learning does not always have a beneficial effect on students. Besides, practical rather than theoretical problems related to use of gamification in education have been more the focus of research by now. It is therefore desirable to consider at the theoretical level the role of game technologies in education taking into account the systemic nature of man’s spiritual life and values and ideologies as its constituent parts. The research aim is to determine the degree of applicability of gamification in education determined by a specific system of values and ideologies every participant of educational process has. To achieve this goal, secondary analysis of scientific literature on this problem was applied, main approaches to gamification were singled out and evaluated. Secondly, using systematic approach it is shown that the nature of the impact of gamification depends on the level and character of the development of a person’s values and ideologies. The research employs basic scientific and special scientific methods typical of social and humanitarian studies. At the same time, the important role among them is played by the system analysis method that allows us to consider the use of games for learning in educational not in isolation but taking into account the role of basic factors of a person’s spiritual life, especially his world outlook. This allows for a many-sided analysis of causes of difficulties which appear when using games for learning. The novelty of this research lies in showing the dependence of the character and results of gamification on man’s values and ideologies. © 2016 The Author(s).";"13063065";3;"Russia";"Scopus"

Likewise, the objective of this study is to present the design and the development of an educational web application for learning the necessary steps towards the detection of bogus content, according to the fact-checking procedures. The game presents news articles, which have to be characterized as fake or real by the players. During the effort to reach the correct decision, the players can use tools and practices for identifying relevant information regarding the clues, which frame a news story (title, date, creator, source, containing images). After presenting the progress of interface design and development, this paper reports the results of a randomized online field study (n = 111), which provides some preliminary evidence. Specifically, it is validated that the game can raise awareness, teach about authentication tools, and highlight the importance of patterns that include evidence regarding the authenticity of articles. Additionally, thorough discussion was conducted within a media class (n = 35) to receive useful feedback/evaluation about the offered utilities and their usability.

Whether an innovative interactive e-learning multimedia (IM) module or a conventional PowerPoint show (PPS) module using M-TEL to teach emergent otorhinolaryngology–head and neck surgery (ORL-HNS) disorders is feasible and efficient in undergraduate medical students is unknown. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the impact of a novel IM module with a conventional PPS module using M-TEL for emergent ORL-HNS disorders with regard to learning outcomes, satisfaction, and learning experience. Methods: This pilot study was conducted at an academic teaching hospital and included 24 undergraduate medical students who were novices in ORL-HNS. The cognitive style was determined using the Group Embedded Figures Test. The participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to one of the two groups matched by age, sex, and cognitive style: the IM group and the PPS group. During the 100-min learning period, the participants were unblinded to use the IM or PPS courseware on a 7-inch tablet. Pretests and posttests using multiple-choice questions to evaluate knowledge and multimedia situational tests to evaluate competence were administered. Participants evaluated their satisfaction and learning experience by the AttrakDiff2 questionnaire, and provided feedback about the modules. Results: Overall, the participants had significant gains in knowledge (median of percentage change 71, 95% CI 1-100, P<.001) and competence (median of percentage change 25, 95% CI 0-33, P=.007) after 100 min of learning. Although there was no significant difference in knowledge gain between the two groups (median of difference of percentage change 24, 95% CI −75 to 36; P=.55), competence gain was significantly lower in the IM group compared with the PPS group (median of difference of percentage change −41, 95% CI −67 to −20; P=.008). However, the IM group had significantly higher scores of satisfaction (difference 2, 95% CI 2-4; P=.01), pragmatic quality (difference 1.7, 95% CI 0.1-2.7; P=.03), and hedonic stimulation (difference 1.9, 95% CI 0.3-3.1; P=.01) compared with the PPS group. Qualitative feedback indicated that the various games in the IM module attracted the participants’ attention but that the nonlinearly arranged materials affected their learning. Conclusions: Using M-TEL for undergraduate medical education on emergent ORL-HNS disorders, an IM module seems to be useful for gaining knowledge, but competency may need to occur elsewhere. While the small sample size reduces the statistical power of our results, its design seems to be appropriate to determine the effects of M-TEL using a larger group.

The purpose of leader board is to view the top scores of players and it can be viewable by all the players. The bottom place in the scoreboard affected motivation in negative way. Some of researchers concluded that some of the students enjoyed the competition and some of them did not. Categorizing appropriate gaming elements for specific audience is difficult. To retain the player’s engagement, the design of the game mechanics must carefully balance so that learners can compete in each other and everyone has the chance to win. We present this study to determine the best gamification mechanics that will use in the mobile learning environment. Analysis Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to determine top six gamification elements for three types of gamification instruction interaction dimension. This method breaks the decision making problem into a hierarchy. Then, a pair wise comparisons matrix will develop to establish the priorities among the elements in the hierarchy. This study involved 84 students from Community Colleague as a sample. The result shows that there are 6 gamification elements have been selected regarding the Global Priorities Distribution for criteria for each alternative which is Check points (0.2924) and Memory Game (0.2698) for Learner-Content Interaction.

At present, the general issues of humanization and pedagogical and methodological support of the educational process are of great importance in light of the need to increase the academic mobility of university graduates who choose to work at universities. The problem of insufficient level of their psychological and pedagogical competence development arises automatically. Psychological and pedagogical competence of a graduate means his (her) ability to mastering the basic material of the psychological and pedagogical unit, the ability to operate the acquired knowledge and put it into practice, mastering acquired skills in the conditions of concrete professional and pedagogical activity. This problem has several solutions. One of the most effective is the possibility of developing and introducing the programmes of advanced psychological and pedagogical training and professional retraining for future engineers specializing in engineering pedagogy. The purpose of the article is to view the effective approaches to the development of psychological and pedagogical competences among future engineers. The authors consider using of the modern IT-technologies to be a strong motivator in this process as well as gamification (role games and business games). As the key tasks of the teaching staff at technical university the following issues are regarded: creation of conditions for the disclosure by future engineers of their professional and personal resources; obtaining by future engineers the information necessary to increase the level of their psychological and pedagogical competence; acquisition of skills necessary for knowledge application in future professional activity; expanding the range of professional competencies of future engineers in the conditions of psychological and pedagogical design. One of the most important aspects of teacher’s activity is reflection, self-evaluation. The authors present teachers’ behavior patterns for reflection and formulate the recommendations for teaching future engineering teachers. Thus, the specificity of training future engineers with the focus on increasing their psychological and pedagogical competence is a complex multi-faceted process, specially organized in time and space, involving consideration of certain psychological and pedagogical, methodological and methodical patterns and aimed at developing professional qualifications of future engineering pedagogues. © 2019 Moscow Polytechnic University.

We developed the Gamification project through a pre-experimental design for six months. The sample consisted of 96 Basic Education students (M = 6.56 years of age; SD = 0.3). The pre-calculation test allowed us to contrast results between the pretest and posttest measurements. We obtained effective results in the dimensions of seriation, cardinality and cognitive conservation. The effects were much more decisive in conservation. These results allowed obtaining that the complexity of this game allowed to reduce the cognitive reload in the mathematical operations, as well as to increase the sustained attention in the development of logical reasoning tasks, and to achieve greater fluency in the operational calculation. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

In the context of virtual education, a question that remains to be solved is associated with the level of motivation possessed by the students during the course. Usually, at the School of Engineering in the University of Medellín, this issue is tackled through activities such as chats and forums. Mostly, these activities are not enough to motivate the student in the activities related with the learning process. This work proposes two motivation strategies based on gamification and constructivism. These strategies are validated in a course called programming fundamentals, taught to all bachelor degrees given in the School of Engineering. Results obtained through the experiments suggest that proposed strategies improve the students performance and satisfaction in the course. Therefore, when teaching at the virtual scenario, using Information and Communication Technologies in the educational environment is not only the way to contact the student, it is the mean to develop pedagogical-didactic approaches that finally enrich the educational process and consequently motivate the student to perform well. © 2003-2012 IEEE.";"15480992";6;"Colombia";"Scopus"

Termed massive open online courses (MOOCs), these soon fell into different categories, depending on their concept. Among them are connectivist massive open online courses (cMOOCs) which emphasise a collaborative approach to learning. However, while initial enrolment is indeed massive, completion rates are very low and cMOOCs notoriously lack an appropriate method of evaluating learning progress and motivational resources. The author of this article suggests that one way of addressing this problem might be to adapt motivational formative assessment tools used in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) to cMOOCs. He argues that some characteristics of MMORPGs can be effectively incorporated in cMOOCs, thus benefiting from the motivational potential of MMORPGs. He cautions, however, that even if MMORPGs (and ongoing, low-stakes formative assessment in general) are motivational, they can only be applied to cMOOCs if the idea of formative assessment is not in tension with connectivist principles. Hence, the author argues for their compatibility, and builds on peer-to-peer assessment as a solution for resource allocation problems with low instructor–learner ratio. © 2020, The Author(s).";"00208566";4;"Hungary";"Scopus"

Faced with persistent physical symptoms and debilitating social consequences, patients follow complex treatment regimens and often have difficulty adhering to them. Purpose: In this manuscript, we review factors which contribute to low adherence rates and advance potential single-and multi-factor-based interventions. It is hoped that these observa-tions can lead to improvements in managed care of this vulnerable population of patients. Methods: A narrative review of the primary literature was performed on contributing factors with primary focus on the period 2015–2020 using available databases and search engines. Adherence pain points identified were mapped against a series of potential solutions which are presented. Results: Enhancement of treatment adherence relies on two approaches viz. single-factor and multi-factor solutions. Single factors identified include electronic reminders, enhanced health education, financial incentives, gamification strategies, community drivers, persona-based modeling, and burden relief of poly pharmacy. Multi-factor solutions combine two or more of the seven approaches offering the potential for flexible interventions tailored to the individual. Discussion and Conclusion: Heart failure patients with poor adherence have increased mortality, hospitalization needs, and healthcare costs. This review highlights current single-factor and multi-factor adherence methods. Against a backdrop of diversity of approaches, multi-factor solutions cast the widest net for positively influencing adherent behaviors. A key enabler lies in the development and leveraging of patient personas in the synthesis of successful intervention methods. Deployable solutions can also be envisioned in clinical trials where adherence tracking represents an essential component. © 2020 Makris et al.";"1177889X";NA;"United States";"Scopus"

The design and development of socio-educational and community projects in music training centres are tasks which, in using music as a tool towards mediation, can contribute to alleviate social dysfunctions in the nearby surroundings as well as to create social cohesion and feelings of community belonging and identity. Nevertheless, there is some inertia in the way things are done and a perpetuation of traditional models of education in music where there is no room for innovative projects with authentic social engagement. This paper will analyse the challenges and contexts that music schools face in the 21st Century at a social and community level, and how to address them with new educational models. The social commitment and engagement of music training institutions should spark a change in the design of activities through innovation as well as opening new avenues for collaboration with other social and institutional community actors.

Educators can use virtual learning environments as context, providing learning tools to practice language and comprehension. Gamification is not a new buzzword in education. Educators need to have stupendous classroom management skills to implement in a language classroom. Educators‟ as well as learners‟ attitudes towards learning, have to transform to a great extend to try out gamification within the classroom, without affecting the decorum of the learning atmosphere. The affective filter hypothesis of Stephen Krashen states that various psychological barriers can hurdle the acquisition of language learning. Anxiety or fear, lack of motivation, the diffidence of the learner are some mental blocks that can affect the learning experience. The communication skills of the learners can be enhanced only with the support of a learner-friendly atmosphere.

It is also widely believed that young learners learn the best with the provision of tactile or kinesthetic learning opportunities, which is discounted with digital learning aids. The current study employed the tactile approach to language learning by developing non-digital language games for middle school EFL learners. A quasi-experimental research design was used. The respondents were one hundred class-eight EFL learners from two Saudi schools.

It is one of the most challenging problems inherent in all forms and levels of education, especially in e-learning. It can be partially solved through gamification. In foreign countries, gamification is a recognized technology having methodological and didactic advantages; it has been actively studied and used for many years. In Russia, this promising and popular technology has been addressed and started developing only recently. It should be noted that most studies on gamification (both Russian and foreign) tend to focus on its stimulus-response patterns without delving into its motivational capabilities underlying its efficiency. There is not enough understanding of the differences between external and internal motivations and their role in gamification to create a long-term and sustainable effect. Our research intends to make a theoretical contribution to this field. For this purpose, we look into gamification in terms of philosophical and cultural approaches and analyze motivation theories with regard to gamification. We will use the key concepts of philosophy of pragmatism and social phenomenology and the Self-Determination Theory (SDT), the flow theory and the Transactional analysis (TA) as a theoretical and methodological framework. The philosophical concepts that we took as a theoretical and methodological basis have never been used in gamification analysis. Thus, they represent scientific novelty of our research. Based on the research results, the authors substantiate the thesis that intrinsic motivation plays an essential (but not an exclusive!) role in gamification. It is game thinking that contributes to the formation of internal motivation, in contrast to the game mechanics ('points, badges and leaderboards'), which is focused on external motivation. Showed that gamification is quite a challenging technology; when it is used, priority attention should be given to maintaining the balance between its utilitarian (educational) and hedonic (recreational) functions. In gamification, as distinct from any games (real and digital), entertainment is a method rather than a purpose; forgetting this obvious fact is fraught with negative consequences. It is concluded that gamification should never be seen as a universal remedy. © 2020 LLC Ecological Help. All rights reserved.";"23072334";NA;"Russia";"Scopus"

The potential of social networks has also been harnessed by educators and institutions either using popular social networking sites or specific educational instances. This paper studies how well-established approaches (educational game and social networking) compare with more novel ones (gamification and social gamification) in terms of learning performance in an undergraduate course. Four experimental conditions were compared in an experiment (N = 379). Results suggest that all experimental conditions significantly impact on learning performance, but social gamification returned better results in terms of immediacy and for all types of assessments. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the online platform KOLEGEA, presented here, aims to support postgraduate training in general practice (PT in GP) in Germany through virtual interaction. Methodology: In 2012, the interdisciplinary research project KOLEGEA set up an online platform that any physicians in PT in GP can use for free after registration with their unitary continuous education number (Einheitliche Fortbildungsnummer, EFN). It offers problem-based learning and allows to discuss self-published anonymized patient cases with the community that can be classified and discussed with experienced mentors (specialists in general practice - GPs) in small virtual groups. Results: An anonymous online survey carried out as part of the 2014 project evaluation showed a good acceptance of the platform, even though shortage of time was mentioned as a limiting factor for its use. Data analysis showed that KOLEGEA was used by PPT in GP in all federal states. Patterns of passive use were predominant (90%). This report also describes the further development of the platform (in 2015 and 2016) that integrates an activity monitor as part of a gamification concept. Conclusions: Due to a low response rate of the 2014 online survey and the preliminary evaluations of usage patterns we could identify only initial trends regarding the role of KOLEGEA in supporting PPT. The platform was perceived as a helpful supplement to better structure PT in GP. © 2017 Dini et al.";"23665017";3;"Germany";"Scopus"

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) applications are essentially practical, as their intelligence resides in the software part. Therefore, the proposed course emphasizes drone programming through practical learning. It comprises a collection of exercises resembling drone applications in real life, such as following a road, visual landing, and people search and rescue, including their corresponding background theory. The course has been successfully taught for five years to students from several university engineering degrees. Some exercises from the course have also been validated in three aerial robotics competitions, including an international one. RoboticsAcademy is also briefly presented in the paper. It is an open framework for distance robotics learning in engineering degrees. It has been designed as a practical complement to the typical online videos of massive open online courses (MOOCs). Its educational contents are built upon robot operating system (ROS) middleware (de facto standard in robot programming), the powerful 3D Gazebo simulator, and the widely used Python programming language. Additionally, RoboticsAcademy is a suitable tool for gamified learning and online robotics competitions, as it includes several competitive exercises and automatic assessment tools. © 2020 by the authors.

Thirty-five patients attending a Canadian thalassemia clinic were enrolled. Acting in an expert role, they participated in a Delphi method to reach consensus as to what tools and information should be incorporated in the development of a self management Smartphone app. One- and 6-month usability and health impact feedback surveys were built-in. Sixty percent of responders were 18–34 years old, over 50.0% had a college degree. The Delphi method successfully generated a comprehensive list of features important to patients. The app has been downloaded 147 times globally. Between March 2015 and January 2016, 19 responses for the 1-month survey were collected and the trends described. Responders reported improved medication adherence. The personal adherence pledge feature supports gamification of health apps to individualize goals of therapy. The impact of tracking iron levels was highly favorable. The Delphi method was an effective way to introduce a patient education and empowerment tool to the thalassemia population. The long-term impact requires data maturation.

Demonstrating the rationale and mechanics of reporting may improve this. Methods: We designed and implemented an escape room patient safety simulation to incorporate active learning, gamification, and adult learning theory into intern patient safety onboarding. Interns from all sponsoring institution programs participated, identifying, mitigating, and reporting a range of patient safety hazards. Props and faculty time were the major resources required. Results: One hundred twenty interns participated in this simulation in June 2018. Forty-one percent reported previous training on reporting errors, and only 5% had previously entered an event report. Average confidence in ability to identify patient safety hazards improved after the simulation from 6.35 to 8.00 on a 10-point rating scale. The simulation was rated as relevant or highly relevant to practice by 96% of interns. Discussion: Several factors contribute to a low error-reporting rate among house staff. We developed a simulation modeled on popular escape room activities to increase awareness of safety hazards and ensure familiarity with the actual online reporting system our interns will use in the clinical environment.

A variety of methodologies have been published for developing gamification. However, some of these are only usable by people with a certain level of gamification knowledge. People who do not have such knowledge face difficulty in using game mechanics and experiencing enjoyment. To ease their difficulties, a gamification methodology should provide directions for using game mechanics. Objective: This study aimed at collecting global gamification cases and determining patterns or differences among the collected cases. Methods: In total, 754 cases were collected based on 4F process elements, such as play type, playful user experience (PLEX)–based fun factors, and game mechanics. In addition, the collected cases were classified into 6 categories. From the data analysis, basic statistics and correlation analyses (Pearson and Kendall) were conducted. Results: According to the analysis results in PLEX-based fun factors, challenge and completion fun factors formed a large proportion among the 6 categories. In the results of the game mechanics analysis, point, leaderboard, and progress accounted for a large proportion among the 6 categories. The results of the correlation analysis showed no difference or specific patterns in game mechanics (Pearson r>.8, Kendall τ>.5, P<.05) and PLEX-based fun factors (Pearson r>.8, Kendall τ>.7, P<.05). Conclusions: On the basis of the statistical findings, this study suggests an appropriate number of PLEX-based fun factors and game mechanics. In addition, the results of this study should be used for people who do not have gamification knowledge and face difficulty using game mechanics and PLEX-based fun factors. © Sungjin Park, Sangkyun Kim.";"14388871";6;"South Korea";"Scopus"

Including game elements and digital services into the students' cognitive activity are the current trends in the development of the didactic system. The designing of an interactive escape room as an organizational form of cognition and learning technology is one of the ways of gamification of the digital educational space. The authors investigate the problems of forming the high-demanded competencies through interactive quest games. These competencies are necessary for graduates to solve future professional tasks and for successful socialization. Research methods. The analysis of fundamental scientific works on the problem of gamification in education and the usage of digital resources for forming high-demanded soft skills were used to obtain theoretical generalizations. The escape room was designed using modern interactive technologies. 48 students of specialty 44.03.01 Pedagogical education (31% of boys and 69% of girls) of Vyatka State University, Kirov, were involved in the designing of game areas for educational purposes. At the control stage of the experiment, the G-criterion was used to evaluate the changes in over-professional competencies being formed. Results. The essence of the concept of an escape room has been clarified as a game space fully adapted to a specific story, and each single element of which is designed to respond to one common plot, including thematic tasks. The stages of designing and implementation of the escape room for educational purposes were described: determination of the system of planned results, over-subject competencies; development of the game scenario; reasonable choice of software and hardware support; correlation of the emotional and psychological component with the filling of the interactive educational space. The empirical value of Gemp=3&lt;Gcr=9 (for p=0.01) obtained in the course of the experiment confirms that the shift towards improving the quality of learning after applying the proposed approach is not random. In conclusion, the authors generalized the factors that provide the effective use of interactive resources of escape rooms to form the high-demanded soft skills: taking into account the peculiarities of game mechanics; professional aspirations and interests; students' cognition style; correlation of actually formed soft skills with planned ones, etc. © 2020 LLC Ecological Help.

The main purpose of the study was to give insights into the pedagogy of using Minecraft within such a context. Interviews were undertaken with practicing teachers, observations were carried out and related documents were analysed. The data produced was qualitative, while the analysis was based on grounded theory principles and an interpretive paradigm. The key issues under consideration in the research were the following: a) the role of teachers in this game-driven educational context, b) the extent to which the Minecraft software affects students' learning practices and c) how the teachers' pedagogy could be enhanced. The study revealed both pedagogical benefits and drawbacks. The findings from this study suggest that students were mostly motivated to use Minecraft in its creative mode that enhanced learners' problem solving skills and helped them to reach a compromise. The high creative potential of Minecraft also offered teachers a broad range of possibilities to assign interdisciplinary project-based collaborative tasks. © 2017, All Rights Reserved.";"12201766";4;"Romania";"Scopus"

This model combines the advantages of gamification, the flipped classroom and the use of low-fidelity clinical simulation, also including self-reflection and peer evaluation of the situations experienced. Objectives: To evaluate the students' perception of the implementation of GREENS© as a learning and assessment tool in an academic course at the University of Almeria. Design: A cross-sectional descriptive study. Settings: Academic year 2018/2019, at the University of Almeria (UAL), Spain. Participants: 77 students enrolled in their 2nd year of the Nursing Degree who attended the “Health Promotion and Safety” class. Methods: After completing the GREENS© activity, the perception and anxiety of students were analyzed through an online ad hoc questionnaire composed of 17 questions. Data were collected in January 2019. Results: All of the questions scored above 4 out of a maximum of 5 on a Likert scale. For all the questions, >50% of the students were in total agreement with the questions answered, showing a high acceptance of the GREENS© methodology implementation. The students reported that their anxiety decreased significantly, with a score of 4.7 points on average (95% CI: 4.16 to 5.33, p < 0.001), after knowing that the assessment would be through a gamification tool, not an oral one. More than 60% of the students answered “agree” or “strongly agree” with the idea that GREENS© is useful for improving motivation, teamwork, learning, fun and knowledge assessment. Conclusions: The use of GREENS© has generated a high satisfaction and motivation of the students in their learning process, and as an assessment tool, it created a lower degree of anxiety as compared to an oral examination. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd";"02606917";NA;"Spain";"Scopus"

The solution to this problem is considered from the perspective of organizational measures and cybernetic methods, and the personal learning environment is regarded as a tool. The study aims to reveal the possibility and feasibility of using this environment as a tool to improve students' performance. For this purpose, the relationship between students' use of a personal learning environment and their academic performance in the educational process was determined by the methods of clustering and mathematical statistics. Students who use the tools of the personal learning environment have a higher average grade, are more successful in interim attestations, less frequently retake examinations or are expelled due to academic failures. The study resulted in identifying four clusters of students with pronounced characteristics, representing independent groups of students, to which a certain organizational impact can be applied to improve academic performance. The possibility of flexible use of tools of the personal learning environment (ratings, achievements, signs, and active notifications) to influence students from different clusters is shown. From the perspective of the educational process, these tools are auxiliary because they are not used directly for training, but make it possible to discipline students, to increase self-organization and interest in the learning process. As a result, students' performance and the effectiveness of the activity of the educational organization in general are improved. © 2019 LLC Ecological Help.

Previous studies showed that the existing mobile applications have similar functionalities, such as intervention with questionnaires, and the use of gamification techniques to improve interactiveness. However, unlike our study, some studies are not validated and verified by healthcare professionals. Additionally, this study intends to promote the interaction between the teenagers and the medical communities. In this study, we analyze the benefits of the proposed mobile application, which features monitoring of physical activity, daily tips and curiosities, questionnaires, and gamification through earning points. Most of the teenagers were satisfied with the physical activity monitoring and found the tips, curiosities, and weekly questionnaires useful. The study started with 26 teenagers from two schools in the center of Portugal that would use the mobile application for five weeks. Still, at the end of the study, only 7 teenagers finalized the study. The decreasing number of teenagers in the study was affected by the lack of social interaction caused by the pandemic situation. During the period, the mobile application would engage the users with notifications on nutrition and physical activity, challenges concerning the number of steps and calories they would have to spend, and questionnaires related to the curiosities and suggestions from the previous week. We used Fisher’s test to investigate the relationship between the assessment obtained in the responses to the questionnaires, and the adoption of healthier eating and sports practices. In summary, participants were satisfied with the mobile application and experienced some improvements in diet and habits. © 2020 by the authors.";"22279032";NA;"Portugal";"Scopus"

No studies have investigated the effects of a comprehensive gamification curriculum on the acquisition of endoscopic skills among novice endoscopists. Methods and analysis Thirty-six novice endoscopists will be randomised to one of two endoscopy SBT curricula: (1) the Conventional Curriculum Group, in which participants will receive 6 hours of one-on-one simulation training augmented with expert feedback and interlaced with 4 hours of small group teaching on the theory of colonoscopy or (2) the Gamified Curriculum Group, in which participants will receive the same curriculum with integration of the following game-design elements: A leaderboard summarising participants' performance, game narrative, achievement badges and rewards for top performance. In line with a progressive learning approach, simulation training for participants will progress from low to high complexity simulators, starting with a bench-top model and then moving to the EndoVR virtual reality simulator. Performance will be assessed at three points: Pretraining, immediately post-training and 4-6 weeks after training. Assessments will take place on the simulator at all three time points and transfer of skills will be assessed during two clinical colonoscopies 4-6 weeks post-training. Mixed factorial ANOVAs will be used to determine if there is a performance difference between the two groups during simulated and clinical assessments.

The current work introduces a new process-based approach, based on collected large log files and associations of underlying decisions based on them. Both of them deal with work in extracting information for intelligent use, the main difference being that the first discovers but stops on a concept relation basis, while the other based on processes, as knowledge transactions, further to the associations on a 1:1 level maybe applied on a multi associative model. The objective of the current work is to introduce the methodology into gamified environments (such as but not limited to) games, for semi-automated understanding of user behaviour and furthermore, prediction and in instances, guidance via optimal paths of decision making activities, that are useful in gamified applications in various areas like the education. Both the initial ontology based, and the extension work on it, are based on mining association rules, in one instance treated as knowledge nodes (concepts) and in the second as underlying knowledge processes, based on big log files. This may be applicable to online games, that generate big log files of user selections, that are available for study and examination for extracting user behavioural patterns. As a result, maximum length of sequential patterns and items in them, are discovered in an algorithmic based methodological approach, providing in this way a set of guidelines for designing gamified applications. © 2019 ASTES Publishers.

The thesis that the functioning of the educational system increasingly detects formal rationality, not focused on the senses, and their imitation. It is noted that the Russian system of higher education refers to a specific type, which can be rightly defined as ""culture-centric"". This type have a number of traits: dominance conception of education as a complex of practices, with the aim of translation of cultural codes from older to younger generations; the idea of the sacred nature of the educational process as a student-deterministic; installation of universality, according to which university graduates must be not only professionally prepared and fully developed; priority of content and semantic aspects of education in relation to formal, often even to the detriment of the latter; belief in the special position of the higher education sector, as well as education in general in relation to other spheres of activity. It is emphasized that the logical consequence of the transition to the formal rationality becomes a management simulation in which real values and meanings are replaced and replaced by a formal reproduction of operations and procedures, followed by their demonstration, declaration and decoration. It is proved that the main source of formal rationalization is a corporate bureaucracy.

One of the main elements is the lack of motivation of the students before the learning that they must carry out in class. Active methodologies are presented as an alternative for students to actively build their learning, with the teacher's guidance. Among the active methodologies is gamification, which is presented as a methodology using techniques and structures of the game in non-recreational contexts, to provoke and build learning. This research aims to define and contrast an explanatory model about the personal dimensions that become part of the students with the use of this methodology such as the student's mastery, enjoyment, the absence of negative effect and absorption with respect to creative student thinking. The instrument used is the GAMEX questionnaire, translated and validated by the authors of this manuscript for this context, as a previous investigation to the current one. The results obtained show that there is a positive relationship between all dimensions, that is, the student's mastery, their enjoyment, the absence of a negative effect and the student's absorption with the student's creative thinking.

Based on the research results, three hypotheses were tested. These hypotheses give a better insight into some psychological phenomes. The first hypotheses tested the level of knowledge in experimental and control groups for all students who achieved a minimum of 50% score in the pre-test. Our results confirmed the existence of statistically significant difference in the benefit of the experimental group. The other two hypotheses are spreading results even more. We analyzed 50% of the highest ranked and also 50% of the lowest ranked students' score with the use of t-test. Based on our analysis of the average number of points on the post-test for participants with the lowest ranking we found no statistically significant difference.

Since these algorithms are complex, there is a need for a system which would enable their application both in everyday work and education processes. This paper describes a software system for learning AI algorithms called SAIL (Software System for AI Learning), which can be used both on computers and mobile devices. The paper gives examples of lab exercises and self-study tasks that through graphic representation and detailed procedures help students master this area. Students can enter their examples into the system and obtain correct solutions for those examples. At any point when an example is simulated, a student can proceed to the next step or go back to the previous one, save the current simulation as a file, or print the detailed procedure as a task solution. SAIL helps lecturers go through the syllabus more efficiently and improve class material, while at the same time it helps students get a better grasp of implemented algorithms. SAIL can also benefit software engineers, who can select and simulate an adequate algorithm to solve a specific problem. The results of the SAIL system are verified within the AI introductory course at the School of Electrical Engineering University of Belgrade and they are presented in this paper. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.";"10613773";2;"Serbia";"Scopus"

These strategies are being increasingly used for improving health indicators, even in educational settings; however, there is little information about these terms within the school to promote physical activity (PA). Objective: the aim of this study is to describe a systematic review protocol of school-based interventions for promoting PA in pre-schoolers, children, and adolescent students using games and gamification. Methods: This review protocol is registered in International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42019123521). Scientific databases include PubMed, Web of Science, SportDiscus, Cochrane Library, ERIC, and PsycINFO. A standardized procedure will be executed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol (PRISMA-P) checklist for conducting systematic review protocols and the PICOS (Population, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes, and Study design) tool to address an appropriate search strategy. Detailed information will be extracted, including a quantitative assessment using effect sizes to compare the interventions and a qualitative assessment using the Evaluation of Public Health Practice Projects (EPHPP) tool.

The objective of the study is to analyze the relevance and progression that the concepts “gamification” and “learning” have acquired in the scientific literature of Web of Science. This research has been based on a bibliometric methodology. A classic bibliometric and thematic analyses have been carried out. A 1230 document matrix analysis has been selected. For descriptive bibliometrics, the Bibliometrix library is used, while Scimat is used for the thematic analysis. Both tools are widely used in this type of study. Results indicate that growth on the study of these topics is booming. There are also authors who accumulate most of the documents, such as Martí Parreño. English is positioned as the predominant language. The topics studied have evolved from how classic games affect learning to the study of video games and their impact on performance. It is concluded that these types of studies are still relevant and with a great future prospect.

Digital visualizations of such historic objects allow for a more natural view of history as well as showing information that is not possible in a real world setting. New presentation forms, such as the virtual reality (VR) system HTC Vive, can be used to disseminate information in another dimension and simplify the access by changing the user’s viewpoint from a listener and viewer into being an integrated part of an interactive situation. In general, this approach is a combination of education and entertainment, also known as “edutainment” or “gamification” (Reinhardt 2007), a term used in the education sector when describing where motivation to learn is encouraged through adding a competitive element. It is thus a step away from simple consumption of information towards experiencing information and a more literal interpretation of “living history”. In this contribution, we present the development of a 3-D reconstruction of the two towns Segeberg and Gieschen-hagen (today: Bad Segeberg) in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany in the Early Modern Age around 1600. The historic landscape and its conversion from a reconstructed virtual town model into an interactive VR application is also described.

""Applied games"" including serious games (in brief, computerized games for serious purposes) and gamification (gaming elements used outside of games) have the potential to increase the impact of mental health internet interventions via three processes. First, by extending the reach of online programs to those who might not otherwise use them. Second, by improving engagement through both game-based and ""serious"" motivational dynamics. Third, by utilizing varied mechanisms for change, including therapeutic processes and gaming features. In this scoping review, we aim to advance the field by exploring the potential and opportunities available in this area. We review engagement factors which may be exploited and demonstrate that there is promising evidence of effectiveness for serious games for depression from contemporary systematic reviews. We illustrate six major categories of tested applied games for mental health (exergames, virtual reality, cognitive behavior therapy-based games, entertainment games, biofeedback, and cognitive training games) and demonstrate that it is feasible to translate traditional evidence-based interventions into computer gaming formats and to exploit features of computer games for therapeutic change. Applied games have considerable potential for increasing the impact of online interventions for mental health. However, there are few independent trials, and direct comparisons of game-based and non-game-based interventions are lacking. Further research, faster iterations, rapid testing, non-traditional collaborations, and user-centered approaches are needed to respond to diverse user needs and preferences in rapidly changing environments. © 2017 Fleming, Bavin, Stasiak, Hermansson-Webb, Merry, Cheek, Lucassen, Lau, Pollmuller and Hetrick.";"16640640";169;"United Kingdom";"Scopus"

A novel application of serious games in engaging and educating end-users has been validated during the last years. However, there is little research focusing on the review of its development trends, categories and approaches. The proposed paper reviews serious games as an engaging medium for building energy consumption. The research focuses on the role of energy-consumption awareness-related education in motivating end-users to save energy and make informed decisions to change energy-related behaviours. This research stresses the approaches to underlining the issue as ascertained from a number of efficiency-related serious games. The investigation suggests the potential impact that serious games can have on changing the domestic practices of householders, in a safe, fun and interactive environment. This would enable householders to investigate alternative ways of meeting energy-consumption targets and realise the limits to their energy-saving potential. It concludes that at present, serious games do not take advantage of the opportunities available in energy monitoring and sub-metering, or real-life energy behaviours. Meanwhile, the existing evaluation framework for the effectiveness of an energy serious game still needs to be further developed. However, active engagement in energy monitoring has contributed to numerous past successes in energy use reduction, and gamification and serious games show great potential for building upon these achievements. © 2020 by the authors.

Serious gaming and gamification education have the potential to provide a quality, cost-effective, novel approach that is flexible, portable, and enjoyable and allow interaction with tutors and peers. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of serious gaming/gamification for health professions education compared with traditional learning, other types of digital education, or other serious gaming/gamification interventions in terms of patient outcomes, knowledge, skills, professional attitudes, and satisfaction (primary outcomes) as well as economic outcomes of education and adverse events (secondary outcomes). Methods: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, Educational Resources Information Centre, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature was conducted from 1990 to August 2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently searched, screened, and assessed the study quality and extracted data. A meta-analysis was not deemed appropriate due to the heterogeneity of populations, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes. Therefore, a narrative synthesis is presented. Results: A total of 27 RCTs and 3 cluster RCTs with 3634 participants were included. Two studies evaluated gamification interventions, and the remaining evaluated serious gaming interventions. One study reported a small statistically significant difference between serious gaming and digital education of primary care physicians in the time to control blood pressure in a subgroup of their patients already taking antihypertensive medications. There was evidence of a moderate-to-large magnitude of effect from five studies evaluating individually delivered interventions for objectively measured knowledge compared with traditional learning. There was also evidence of a small-to-large magnitude of effect from 10 studies for improved skills compared with traditional learning. Two and four studies suggested equivalence between interventions and controls for knowledge and skills, respectively. Evidence suggested that serious gaming was at least as effective as other digital education modalities for these outcomes. There was insufficient evidence to conclude whether one type of serious gaming/gamification intervention is more effective than any other. There was limited evidence for the effects of serious gaming/gamification on professional attitudes. Serious gaming/gamification may improve satisfaction, but the evidence was limited. Evidence was of low or very low quality for all outcomes. Quality of evidence was downgraded due to the imprecision, inconsistency, and limitations of the study. Conclusions: Serious gaming/gamification appears to be at least as effective as controls, and in many studies, more effective for improving knowledge, skills, and satisfaction. However, the available evidence is mostly of low quality and calls for further rigorous, theory-driven research. © 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Since the efficacy of this approach depends critically on the reward the trainer provides, we consider how the interaction between the trainer and the agent should be designed so as to increase the efficiency of the training process. This article investigates the influence of the agent’s socio-competitive feedback on the human trainer’s training behavior and the agent’s learning. The results of our user study with 85 participants suggest that the agent’s passive socio-competitive feedback—showing performance and score of agents trained by trainers in a leaderboard—substantially increases the engagement of the participants in the game task and improves the agents’ performance, even though the participants do not directly play the game but instead train the agent to do so. Moreover, making this feedback active—sending the trainer her agent’s performance relative to others—further induces more participants to train agents longer and improves the agent’s learning. Our further analysis shows that agents trained by trainers affected by both the passive and active social feedback could obtain a higher performance under a score mechanism that could be optimized from the trainer’s perspective and the agent’s additional active social feedback can keep participants to further train agents to learn policies that can obtain a higher performance under such a score mechanism. © 2017, The Author(s).";"13872532";10;"United States";"Scopus"

It has become a novel way of interaction among people and influences people’s social lives and public opinion as well as people’s purchasing decisions and businesses. Any website or platform that allows social interaction is considered to be a social media site. Social media use among children in 25 European countries has been reported to be 38% among 9–12 year olds and 77% among those aged 13–16 years. All these children report having their own profile on at least one social network site. While social networking provides children and adolescents with many opportunities and benefits, it also carries many risks. Among the benefits are socialization and communication enhancement, improving learning skills, positive impact on education and getting health information. Potential risks of social media use include falsifying age and identity, cyberbullying, sexting, Facebook depression, gamification, glamourization, cyberostracism and sleep disturbances. Conclusion: Paediatricians play a vital role in promoting the physical, mental and social welfare of all children.

The highly vulnerable population included 155 disadvantaged, high-risk parents (e.g., 76% had a family annual income of less than $15,000; 41% had been incarcerated; 38% were in drug/alcohol treatment; and 24% had had a child removed due to maltreatment). The ethnic groups most commonly identified were African American (24%) and Hispanic (66%). Respondents were primarily mothers (86%) from five community programs in Los Angeles. The study used a single group repeated measures design (pre, post, 6-month follow-up). Data collected included standardized self-report measures, post-intervention focus groups and interviews, website usage reports, and Google Analytics. Significant multivariate ANOVA time effects were found, demonstrating reductions in child behavioral problems, reduced lax/permissive and over-reactive parenting, and decreased parental stress. No effects were found for parental confidence, attributions, or depression and anxiety (which were in the normal range at baseline). Positive effects were maintained or improved at 6-month follow-up. The participants engaged in the online community and valued its flexibility, anonymity, and shared learning. This foundational implementation trial provides support for future rigorous evaluation of social media and gaming features as a medium for increasing parental engagement in evidence-based parenting programs online-a public health approach to protect and improve the development of vulnerable children. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.";"01452134";41;"United States";"Scopus"

This paper analyzes the structure of the social network resulting from a gamified social undergraduate course as well as the influence that student's position has on learning achievement. In a semester long experiment, a social networking site was delivered to students providing gamified activities and enabling social interaction and collaboration. Social network analysis was used to build the network graph and to compute four measures of the overall network and nine measures for each participant. Individual measures were then assessed as predictors of student's achievement using three different methods: Correlation, principal component analysis and multiple linear regressions. The resulting social network has 167 actors and 2505 links, and it can be characterized as a small-world. All analyses agreed on the potential of structural metrics as predictors of learning achievement but they differ in the measures considered as significant. A moderate correlation was found between most centrality measures and learning achievement. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.";"07475632";58;"Spain";"Scopus"

This paper explores and exemplifies three uses of Socrative, a mobile application specifically designed as a clicker for the classroom. Socrative was used during three sessions with the same group of first-year University students at a Faculty of Education. One of these sessions—a review lesson—was gamified, whereas the other two—a collaborative reading activity seminar, and a lecture—were not. Ad-hoc questionnaires were distributed after each of them. Results suggest that students welcome the use of clickers and that combining them with gamification strategies may increase students’ perceived satisfaction.

SonoGames is a competitive games-based event designed to educate and inspire emergency medicine (EM) residents about point-of-care ultrasound. We sought to describe: (1) the perceived effectiveness of a competitive event on both immediate learning and longterm education; and (2) the resultant attitudes of participants and program directors regarding ultrasound training. Methods—The SonoGames Organizational Committee designed 2 surveys: 1 for SonoGames V EM resident participants and a second for EM program directors. Survey questions used a 5-point Likert scale to assess overall perceptions and attitudes about ultrasound, changes in self-reported content knowledge and competency, effects on clinical use, and perceived impacts of a competitive game format on education. Results—Seventy-three resident participants and 42 program directors responded to the survey. Ninety-four percent of participants thought that the competitive gaming format of SonoGames was effective in making the event an educational experience. Participants reported that their ultrasound knowledge increased (81%), their enthusiasm for ultrasound increased (87%), and their clinical use of ultrasound increased (61%). Residency program directors reported similar increases to a lesser degree. Greater advancement through the event was associated with more positive responses. Residencies that participated in the event saw greater increases in the use of ultrasound by residents than those that did not. Conclusions—A competitive games-based educational event focused on point-ofcare ultrasound is an effective educational tool.

National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds competitive, investigator-initiated grant applications. Funded grants represent the state of the science and therefore are expected to anticipate the progression of research in the near future. Objective: The objective of this paper is to provide an analysis of the kinds of smartphone-based intervention apps funded in NIH research grants during the five-year period between 2014 and 2018. Methods: We queried NIH Reporter to identify candidate funded grants that addressed mHealth and the use of smartphones. From 1524 potential grants, we identified 397 that met the requisites of including an intervention app. Each grant’s abstract was analyzed to understand the focus of intervention. The year of funding, type of activity (eg, R01, R34, and so on) and funding were noted. Results: We identified 13 categories of strategies employed in funded smartphone intervention apps. Most grants included either one (35.0%) or two (39.0%) intervention approaches. These included artificial intelligence (57 apps), bionic adaptation (33 apps), cognitive and behavioral therapies (68 apps), contingency management (24 apps), education and information (85 apps), enhanced motivation (50 apps), facilitating, reminding and referring (60 apps), gaming and gamification (52 apps), mindfulness training (18 apps), monitoring and feedback (192 apps), norm setting (7 apps), skills training (85 apps) and social support and social networking (59 apps). The most frequently observed grant types included Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) grants (40.8%) and Research Project Grants (R01s) (26.2%). The number of grants funded increased through the five-year period from 60 in 2014 to 112 in 2018. Conclusions: Smartphone intervention apps are increasingly competitive for NIH funding.

Although teachers offer the information foundation and relationship among knowledge points, there are still few methods to encourage students to explore the structure of knowledge by themselves outside of classes. This paper explores the gamification method and the knowledge structure of computer science. We assess the gamification method of ""splitting and combining"" (SC) to encourage students to finish the process of learning structured knowledge in the university. The results show that this method works well in promoting learning enjoyment and that splitting demonstrates better performance than combining.

In particular, several investigations have highlighted the effectiveness of student response systems, or clickers, in different subjects and disciplines. Although some literature reviews have been published on this subject, none of them offer a review of a large volume of publications from a multidisciplinary approach. Similarly, in the literature there are no studies that have analyzed scientific collaborations on this subject. To respond to these concerns, we proposed the use of a bot to retrieve information from a large number of papers (1696 documents co-authored by a total of 4091 researchers) included in the Scopus database. The disciplines covered include natural sciences, engineering and technology, medical and health sciences, agricultural and veterinary sciences, social sciences and humanities, and the arts. The review of the literature reveals that student response systems are generally well-perceived by teachers and students in all the disciplines. Another interesting result achieved from visual data obtained using network visualization software and word clouds is that student response systems are mainly used in some disciplines, such as physics, chemistry, medicine, and nursing. It is clearly observed that the relationship between researchers from the same country is stronger than between researchers from different countries. Finally, some reflections are included on the role of student response systems in online teaching, especially regarding the changes experienced after the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 by the authors.

Interventions that promote healthy sleep, such as those that focus on the dissemination of behavioral and environmental recommendations of sleep hygiene with children, are presented as an alternative. Serious game design offers wide-reaching domains in health applications and is increasing in popularity, particularly with children and teens because of it's potential to engage and motivate players differently from other interventions. This study aims to evaluate effects of serious game on sleep hygiene recommendations ""Perfect Bedroom: learn to sleep well,"" on sleep habits and sleep parameters of healthy children. This is an experimental, prospective and quantitative study. We will randomize children in experimental (n = 88) and no intervention groups (n = 88). The experiment has four stages (pre-intervention, intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up), which will count with participation of children and their parents/guardians. In the evaluation stages, the guardians will answer questionnaires and scales to assess sociodemographic and health data, sleep habits and sleep pattern of their child. The children themselves will answer the following: a scale to assess sleepiness levels, a questionnaire to evaluate the serious game and the game itself, will characterize their bedroom and the activities they perform before sleep, with strategies developed by researches. Intervention with experimental group conducted with the serious game ""Perfect Bedroom"" will happen twice a week, for 3 weeks in a row, resulting in six sessions of 50 min each. Inferential analysis will be conducted for comparisons between groups and intragroups to measure effect of intervention in primary outcomes (sleep habits) and secondary outcomes (sleep parameters). We expect that the intervention with this game can provide valuable evidence to a new approach in promoting healthy sleep habits, with applications in clinical, educational, and familiar settings, which could diminish future health issues and risk at psychiatric diseases, decreasing the social burden of treatments for these conditions in children. © 2018 Almondes and Leonardo.";"16641078";2;"Brazil";"Scopus"

MS-related symptoms impact negatively on the quality of life of persons with MS, who need to be active in the management of their health. mHealth apps could support these patient groups by offering useful tools, providing reliable information, and monitoring symptoms. A previous study from this group identified needs, barriers, and facilitators for the use of mHealth solutions among persons with MS. It is unknown how commercially available health apps meet these needs. Objective: The main objective of this review was to assess how the features present in MS apps meet the reported needs of persons with MS. Methods: We followed a combination of scoping review methodology and systematic assessment of features and content of mHealth apps. A search strategy was defined for the two most popular app stores (Google Play and Apple App Store) to identify relevant apps. Reviewers independently conducted a screening process to filter apps according to the selection criteria. Interrater reliability was assessed through the Fleiss-Cohen coefficient (k=.885). Data from the included MS apps were extracted and explored according to classification criteria. Results: An initial total of 581 potentially relevant apps was found. After removing duplicates and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 30 unique apps were included in the study. A similar number of apps was found in both stores. The majority of the apps dealt with disease management and disease and treatment information. Most apps were developed by small and medium-sized enterprises, followed by pharmaceutical companies. Patient education and personal data management were among the most frequently included features in these apps. Energy management and remote monitoring were often not present in MS apps. Very few contained gamification elements. Conclusions: Currently available MS apps fail to meet the needs and demands of persons with MS. There is a need for health professionals, researchers, and industry partners to collaborate in the design of mHealth solutions for persons with MS to increase adoption and engagement. © Guido Giunti, Estefanía Guisado Fernández, Enrique Dorronzoro Zubiete, Octavio Rivera Romero.";"22915222";25;"Spain";"Scopus"

Gamification is increasingly gaining attention among system designers across various industries especially in education due to the benefits associated with its implementation. The adoption of gamification in information systems (IS) education is promising for engaging and motivating students to complete their degree programs. Call for research in this area is particularly on the increase in the IS field. Accordingly, we need to organize the aggregation of research in this area and use common terminologies to promote progressive research practice in the field. In this paper, we use a multi-method approach to systematically review existing research on gamification in IS education to identify common terminologies, identify trends in topics studied, highlight understudied areas, and, thus, present opportunities for future research. The multi-method approach combines classical systematic review method and social network analysis to provide additional insight into the knowledge structure of researchers involved in the gamification of IS education.

However, despite the rapid change in our technology, lifestyle and needs in the workforce, it has failed to adapt accordingly. The current system relies heavily on industrial-age values where students are expected to follow instructions and are stripped of their agency rather than being encouraged to actively participate in their learning process. As a result, students end up lacking motivation and engagement. Persuasive design focuses on influencing human behavior to improve long-term engagement through various mechanisms. Here, we have embedded the design in the form of gamification elements intothe classroom mechanic to aid in the assessment and modulation of student behavior. ""ExP"", a points-based incentive system tied to all aspects of the classroom mechanics was designed to work in tandem with existing student behavior. Accurate balancing of the system effectively grants students agency and allows more clarity in their classroom interactions and stratagem. The study assesses the effectiveness of the system in improving the academic performance of Diploma-level students. A group of 21 repeating students was observed for an entire semester.

However, many of them consider it difficult. Furthermore, many find these topics less appealing and not connected to their future specialization in different fields of clinical medicine. Student-centred strategies such as problem-based learning, gamification and the use of real data can increase the appeal of a difficult topic such as genetic testing, a field at the crossroads of genetics, molecular biology and bioinformatics. Methods: We designed an electronic teaching application which students registered in the undergraduate Medical Biology course can access online. A study was carried out to assess the influence of implementation of the new method. We performed pretest/posttest evaluation and analyzed the results using the sign test with median values. We also collected students' personal comments. Results: The newly developed interactive application simulates the process of molecular genetic diagnostics of a hereditary disorder in a family. Thirteen tasks guide students through clinical and laboratory steps needed to reach the final diagnosis. Genetics and genomics are fields strongly dependent on electronic databases and computer-based data analysis tools. The tasks employ publicly available internet bioinformatic resources used routinely in medical genetics departments worldwide. Authenticity is assured by the use of modified and de-identified clinical and laboratory data from real families analyzed in our previous research projects. Each task contains links to databases and data processing tools needed to solve the task, and an answer box. If the entered answer is correct, the system allows the user to proceed to the next task. The solving of consecutive tasks arranged into a single narrative resembles a computer game, making the concept appealing. There was a statistically significant improvement of knowledge and skills after the practical class, and most comments on the application were positive. A demo version is available at https://medbio.lf2.cuni.cz/demo-m/. Full version is available on request from the authors. Conclusions: Our concept proved to be appealing to the students and effective in teaching medical molecular genetics.

Adequate use of this equipment is more critical than ever because the risk of shortages must be balanced against the need to effectively protect health care workers, including prehospital personnel. Specific training is therefore necessary; however, the need for social distancing has markedly disrupted the delivery of continuing education courses. Electronic learning (e-learning) may provide significant advantages because it requires neither the physical presence of learners nor the repetitive use of equipment for demonstration. Objective: Inclusion of game mechanics, or “gamification,” has been shown to increase knowledge and skill acquisition. The objective of this research was to develop a gamified e-learning module to interactively deliver concepts and information regarding the correct choice and handling of PPE. Methods: The SERES framework was used to define and describe the development process, including scientific and design foundations. After we defined the target audience and learning objectives by interviewing the stakeholders, we searched the scientific literature to establish relevant theoretical bases. The learning contents were validated by infection control and prehospital experts. Learning mechanics were then determined according to the learning objectives, and the content that could benefit from the inclusion of game mechanics was identified. Results: The literature search resulted in the selection and inclusion of 12 articles. In addition to gamification, pretesting, feedback, avoiding content skipping, and demonstrations using embedded videos were used as learning mechanics. Gamification was used to enhance the interactivity of the PPE donning and doffing sequences, which presented the greatest learning challenges. The module was developed with Articulate Storyline 3 to ensure that it would be compatible with a wide array of devices, as this software generates HTML5-compatible output that can be accessed on smartphones, tablets, and regular computers as long as a recent browser is available. Conclusions: A gamified e-learning module designed to promote better knowledge and understanding of PPE use among prehospital health care workers was created by following the SERES framework. The impact of this module should now be assessed by means of a randomized controlled trial. © 2020 JMIR Publications. All Rights Reserved.";"22919279";13;"Switzerland";"Scopus"

Many people feel concerned about efforts not happening quickly enough to reduce the negative impact on the climate. The responsibility for reversing this trend rests primarily on adults, but hope is now directed more and more toward the younger generation. The present project, which is a collaboration between design and education, lays the foundation for an educational endeavor based on an idea of environmental citizenship. By creating environmental citizen tokens for children and youths, this project aims to change learned living patterns and encourage a new generation to work toward a sustainable climate. There is also good possibility that the young people's involvement and striving for a better environment will transfer to adults. This has become clear in the global movement started by the environmental activist, Greta Thunberg. This article describes the work of designing and preparing the implementation of a learning project, with its basis in knowledge about environmental impact and personal responsibility. The methods underlying the project are gamification and digital activities, allied with a proven system for making a progression of skills visible. The project has resulted in a finished design and an implementation plan, which have been validated through interviews with teacher educators, principals, teachers, student-teachers, parents and pupils, and which after this validation will be tested at ten specially selected Swedish compulsory schools. © 2020 by the authors.";"20711050";1;"Sweden";"Scopus"

The system features moderate gamification, intended to motivate the student to use the machine repeatedly. The system records each handwash stage, and those found to be difficult are identified and reported back. The gamification element alone was not sufficient to encourage repeated use of the machine, with only 13.6 per cent of 611 eligible students interacting with the machine on one or more occasion. Overall engagement remained low (mean sessions per user: 3.5, ±0.60 confidence interval), even following recruitment of infection control ambassadors who were given a specific remit to encourage engagement with the system. Compliance monitoring was introduced to explore how students used the system. Hand hygiene performance did not improve with repeated use. There was evidence that the stages-fingers interlaced, rotation of the thumb, rotation of the fingertips and rotation of the wrists-were more challenging for students to master (p=0.0197 to p<0.0001) than the back of the hand and of the fingers. Veterinary schools wishing to use such a system should consider adopting approaches that encourage peer buy-in, and highlight the ability to practise difficult stages of the technique. © British Veterinary Association 2019.

In pursuit of energy efficiency and true sustainability, buildings must acquire the ability to interact as well as to generate synergies. The most prominent features of this approach are energy management and information flows which, intelligently designed, not only enhance buildings' capabilities, but also introduce a significant change in their relationship with the surrounds ('smart cities') and its inhabitants. This new paradigm calls for revisiting undergraduate architectural instruction, adopting a more complex overview of energy use and management in the design process, regarding buildings as dynamic rather than static entities. The methodology focuses on creating learning environments that favour students' participation in problem solving and assessment, encouraging teamwork based on case studies and stressing the connection between this new architecture, ICTs included, and social networks as participatory design tools. These ideas were implemented in a pilot learning experience conducted at the University of Seville for undergraduate students. The use of ICTs and the collaboration of non-academic experts were observed to further student promotion and projection beyond the academic environment and introduce them to the professional community. © 2018 Author(s).";"19387806";6;"Spain";"Scopus"

Our gamification approach was based on the self-determination theory. According to this theory, people need to have competence, social connectedness, and autonomy in order to feel determined to perform certain activities. We aimed to investigate the effects of teaching presence in online gamification on sustainability learning and self-determination as well as identify the driving factors and barriers to sustaining students' participation in online gamified activity. A mobile application called JouleBug was used. It contains game elements and aims to encourage pro-environmental behaviours. Our quasi-experimental design included two university courses (as control and treatment groups) on sustainable education with 48 participants. Both groups worked with JouleBug, whereas the treatment group was also supported by their teacher's teaching presence. To establish online teaching presence, the teacher shares the students' leader board rankings, acknowledges the students' achievements, and give comments and feedback on students' activities in the chatting group twice a week. Sustainability knowledge and pro-environmental behaviour were measured through survey. Students' performance in the gamified activities was measured through collected points in the JouleBug application. The drivers and barriers to sustaining the students' participation in JouleBug activities were identified through focus group interviews and students' reflection writing. We found there were significant differences in the sustainability knowledge, pro-environmental behaviour, and performance between the treatment and control groups. The Cohen's d effect size value obtained for the treatment on sustainability knowledge, pro-environmental behaviour, and students' performance indicates a large effect as well. Focus group interviews with the participants and the students' reflection writings revealed that the driving factors in sustaining the participation in the gamified activities in the application are recognition by teachers and peers, competition, and sense of belonging to a group. Meanwhile, the barriers to sustaining participation in online gamification are time constraints, boredom caused by lack of social interaction, and boredom caused by activity repetition and activity's inappropriate level of difficulty. The conclusion is the teacher plays a role as an agent in this online gamification learning context. The findings suggest that teaching presence is one of the important building blocks that encourage the students' participation and learning in online gamification. © 2020 by the authors.";"20711050";2;"Malaysia";"Scopus"

Students are even more demanding, and professors need to follow the evolution of technology and try to increase student engagement in the classrooms (presential or virtual). Higher education students recognise that the introduction of new tools and learning methods can improve the teaching quality and increase the motivation to learn. Regarding a question about which type of classes students preferred, ninety-one point ninety-nine per cent (91.99%) of the students wanted interactive classes over traditional. Having this concern in mind over the past years, a professor explored a set of methods, strategies and tools and designed a new and innovative paradigm using gamification. This approach is denominated TechTeach and explores a set of trending concepts and interactive tools to teach computer science subjects. It was designed to run in a B-learning environment. The paradigm uses flipped classrooms, bring your own device (BYOD), gamification, training of soft-skills and quizzes and surveys to increase the student’s engagement and provide the best learning environment to students. Currently, COVID-19 is bringing about new challenges, and TechTeach was improved in order to be more suitable for this new way of teaching (from 0% to 100% online classes). This article details this method and shows how it can be applied in a real environment. A case study was used to prove the functionality and relevance of this approach, and the achieved results are motivating. During the semester, more than a hundred students experienced this new way of teaching and assessment. In the end, more than eighty-one per cent (81%) of the students gave a positive grade to the approach, and more than ninety-five per cent (95.65%) of the students approved the use of the concept of BYOD in the classroom. With TechTeach, the classroom is not a boring place anymore; it is a place to learn and enjoy regardless of being physical or not. © 2020 by the author.

An important aspect of virtual worlds relates to the intelligent, embodied pedagogical agents that are employed to enhance the interaction with students and improve their overall learning experience. The proper design and integration of embodied pedagogical agents in virtual learning environments are highly desirable. Although virtual agents constitute a vital part of virtual environments, their exact impact needs are yet to be addressed and assessed. The aim of the present study is to thoroughly examine and deeply understand the effect that embodied pedagogical agents have on the learning experience of students as well as on their performance. We examine how students perceive the role of pedagogical agents as learning companions during specific game-based activities and the effect that their assistance has on students' learning. A concrete experimental study was conducted in AVARES, a 3D virtual world educational environment that teaches the domain of environmental engineering and energy generation. The results of the study point out that embodied pedagogical agents can improve students' learning experience, enhance their engagement with learning activities and, most of all, improve their knowledge construction and performance. © 2020 by the authors.";"20763417";7;"Greece";"Scopus"

In this study, the treatment group's Spanish language instruction was through the use of Duolingo®, a computer and mobile app that uses gamification and adaptive learning technology to teach foreign languages. Students in the control group received their regularly scheduled English L1/Spanish L2 class learning activities. The study was 12 weeks in duration. Students were assessed with a 50-question, multiple-choice English to Spanish and Spanish to English pretest covering vocabulary and grammar to control for prior Spanish language achievement. Students were assessed with the Pattern of Adaptive Learning Scales’ (PALS) Academic Efficacy subscale to control for prior academic self-efficacy. The same two instruments were used as posttests. An analysis of covariance showed no significant difference in students’ Spanish achievement or in academic self-efficacy between students who used Duolingo® and students who were taught with traditional face-to-face instruction.

Oral health care education is a public health priority as the maintenance of oral hygiene is integral to overall health. Maintaining optimal oral hygiene among children is challenging and can be supported by using relevant motivational approaches. Objective: The primary aim of this study was to identify mobile smartphone apps that include gamification features focused on motivating children to learn, perform, and maintain optimal oral hygiene. Methods: We searched six online app stores using four search terms (“oral hygiene game,” “oral hygiene gamification,” “oral hygiene brush game,” and “oral hygiene brush gamification”). We identified gamification features, identified whether apps were consistent with evidence-based dentistry, performed a quality appraisal with the Mobile App Rating Scale user version (uMARS), and quantified behavior scores (Behavior Change score, uMARS score, and Coventry, Aberdeen, and London-Refined [CALO-RE] score) using three different instruments that measure behavior change. Results: Of 612 potentially relevant apps included in the analysis, 17 met the inclusion criteria. On average, apps included 6.87 (SD 4.18) out of 31 possible gamification features. The most frequently used gamification features were time pressure (16/17, 94%), virtual characters (14/17, 82%), and fantasy (13/17, 76%). The most common oral hygiene evidence-based recommendation was brushing time (2-3 minutes), which was identified in 94% (16/17) of apps. The overall mean uMARS score for app quality was high (4.30, SD 0.36), with good mean subjective quality (3.79, SD 0.71) and perceived impact (3.58, SD 0.44). Sufficient behavior change techniques based on three taxonomies were detected in each app. Conclusions: The majority of the analyzed oral hygiene apps included gamification features and behavior change techniques to perform and maintain oral hygiene in children. Overall, the apps contained some educational content consistent with evidence-based dentistry and high-quality background for oral self-care in children; however, there is scope for improvement. © Nino Fijačko, Lucija Gosak, Leona Cilar, Alenka Novšak, Ruth Masterson Creber, Pavel Skok, Gregor Štiglic.

However, while the number of publications on gamification has been increasing in recent years, a classification of its empirical effects is still missing. We present a systematic literature review conducted with the purpose of closing this gap by clarifying what effects gamification generates on users' behaviour in online learning. Based on the studies analysed, the game elements most used in the literature are identified and mapped with the effects they produced on learners. Furthermore, we cluster these empirical effects of gamification into six areas: performance, motivation, engagement, attitude towards gamification, collaboration, and social awareness. The findings of our systematic literature review point out that gamification and its application in online learning and in particular in Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) are still a young field, lacking in empirical experiments and evidence with a tendency of using gamification mainly as external rewards. Based on these results, important considerations for the gamification design of MOOCs are drawn. © 2019 MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute.

Nonetheless, research on the correlations among learning motivation, cognitive load, learning anxiety and academic performance in gamified learning environments has been minimal. This study, therefore, aims to develop a Gamification Software Engineering Education Learning System (GSEELS) and evaluate the effects of gamification, learning motivation, cognitive load and learning anxiety on academic performance. By applying Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to the empirical research, the questionnaire contains: 1. a Gamification Learning Scale; 2. a Learning Motivation Scale; 3. a Cognitive Load Scale; 4. a Learning Anxiety Scale; and 5. an Academic Performance Scale. A total of 107 undergraduates in two classes participated in this study. The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis includes the path directions and relationship between descriptive statistics, measurement model, structural model evaluation and five variables. The research results support all nine hypotheses, and the research findings also show the effects of cognitive load on learning anxiety, with strong learning motivation resulting from a low learning anxiety. As a result, it is further proven in this study that a well-designed GSEELS would affect student learning motivation and academic performance. Finally, the relationship model between gamification learning, learning motivation, cognitive load, learning anxiety and academic performance is elucidated, and four suggestions are proffered for instructors of software engineering education courses and for further research, so as to assist instructors in the application of favorable gamification teaching strategies. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.";"13807501";35;"Taiwan";"Scopus"

A gamified flipped classroom environment is proposed in this study. The objective of the study is to enhance students’ motivations, learning achievements and their perceptions of the designed environment. In the study, a true experimental design was used. The study was conducted with 61 undergraduate students taking a Physics-2 course. The experimental group students learned in the gamified flipped classroom environment, while the control group students learned with the flipped classroom approach without a gamification strategy. Data were collected from a physics motivation questionnaire, electromagnetism achievement test and semi structured interviews. The experimental results indicate that the students from the experimental group had a significantly increased motivation for the classroom and learning achievements in comparison to the students in the control group. Moreover, it has been determined that the students’ opinions on the gamified classroom environment were positive. Additionally, the students interviewed stated that the approach had positive effects on their motivation for physics class.

Several studies state that the main limitations of the MOOCs are low completion and high dropout rates of participants. However, MOOCs suffer also from the lack of participant engagement, personalization, and despite the fact that several formats and types of MOOCs are reported in the literature, the majority of them contain a considerable amount of content that is mainly presented in a video format. This is in contrast to the results reported in other educational settings, where engagement and active participation are identified as success factors. We present the results of a study that involved educational experts and learning scientists giving new and interesting insights towards the conceptualization of a new design approach, the flipped MOOC, applying the flipped classroom approach to the MOOCs’ design and making use of gamification and learning analytics. We found important indications, applicable to the concept of a flipped MOOC, which entails turning MOOCs from mainly content-oriented delivery machines into personalized, interactive, and engaging learning environments.

Users of weight loss apps can also participate in online forums that act as digital self-help groups. These apps also include several features related to game playing or gamification such as avatars, points and virtual awards. Gamification has the aim of strengthening motivation to carry out a (boring) task. We downloaded the 20 most popular free weight loss apps in Google Play. We analysed app descriptions provided by developers, comments about the selected apps in online forums and user reviews. We focused on four of these apps, since they had some special functions. We found that users’ risk management was based on a mixed method that combined quantification and gamification, that is, rationality and emotions. Quantification, which includes self-tracking, data analysis and graphic layout, provides the ‘rational’ basis for dietary regimes, while gamification provides the emotional support needed to maintain motivation and continue with the diet. Our analysis provides support for the emotion–risk assemblage theory and the in-between strategy. Our analysis reinforces the importance of emotions in risk management. However, these dieting apps are based on a reductionist approach to obesity and weight loss, as obesity is framed as an individual problem, while weight loss is seen as dependent on individual motivation. Such framing tends to conceal the social determinant of health and the social and political causes of obesity. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.";"13698575";34;"United States";"Scopus"

Being a new form of aesthetic, cultural, social, and communicative experience, computer games are beginning to influence our everyday practices. Many of the processes in social life (production, labour, education, rest, communication) become mediated and playful. Game mechanics are used in non-game contexts (this process is called “gamification”), and due to this procedure, the experience of computer games is transmitted to the areas that are considered to entirely lack playfulness: war, pain, violence, corporeal feelings. All in all, nowadays many social relationships are formed by the game. For instance, the space of MMORPG often becomes a laboratory, where social skills are perfected, the first encounter with the other occurs, and the contours of new intersubjectivity are set. In games humans are even more unprotected than on the stage, in a reality-show, or on the battlefield because they cannot hide themselves behind the mask and have to open their face in front of the other to make the game happen. To begin the game, we let the Other (even if objectified in the form of rules) occupy our being. The article considers the examples of how the image of the Other is constructed in games, how the game space, the media field of the game, engenders certain ethical norms and ways of gaming behaviour. The way we look at each other is is determined by media, and in this sense, the game becomes more influential. This fact cannot be ignored by the social sciences, especially by those who explore media reality. Refs 33. © 2017 Saint Petersburg State University.

The article focuses on the effective use of educational interactive technologies in foreign language communication and research activities of students. The purpose of this study is to identify factors which determine the impact of interactive gaming services on formation of students' terminological competence and foreign language proficiency. Materials and Methods. The research methodology involves reviewing literature on the use of interactive game resources in foreign language teaching, as well as analysis and synthesis of the obtained data. The methodological approach taken in this study is the system-activity approach. The educational experiment involved evaluating the possibilities of interactive resources conducted by teachers and assessment of students' foreign language proficiency and research skills. Results. The authors analyze and clarify the concepts of 'interactive game technology' and 'foreign language proficiency'. They argue that development of terminological competence is one of the key stages in formation of foreign language proficiency. The study has revealed the influence of interactive services on organizational aspects of students' communication in a foreign language as well as their research activities. The authors justify the necessity of using interactive game resources in teaching a foreign language as the basis of professional training which meets the requirements of modern digital society. The findings of the survey suggest that teachers are increasingly interested in employing interactive game resources for educational purposes. On the other hand, they report practical difficulties in using them. The empirical study enabled to identify digital tools and interactive technologies which contribute to enhancing foreign language proficiency. Conclusions. In conclusion, the authors summarize the factors determining the influence of interactive technologies on the formation of students' terminological competence and foreign language proficiency through encouraging involvement in learning and research activities within the framework of digital educational environment. © 2020 Novosibirsk State Pedagogical University.

As an alternative, the ‘Escape Room’ teaching game is a much more dynamic option to asses theoretical and practical knowledge, and it may also promote teamwork and the ability to perform under pressure. Objectives: To analyse nursing students’ opinions and study motivations after using the nursing ‘Escape Room’ teaching game. Design: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Participants: Second-year nursing students enrolled in the ‘Adult Nursing 1’ subject. Method: After completing the teaching game, the students who had taken part in it were asked to fill in an ad-hoc questionnaire on the matter. In this game, students have 30 min in which they must solve the riddles and puzzles presented, and thus escape. In doing so, they must demonstrate both theoretical and practical knowledge, and a teacher will remain in the classroom to assess whether the nursing techniques in question are correctly performed. Results: The nursing students who took part in the game strongly believed that this ‘helped them learn the subject’ (4.8 points) and that ‘more games of this type should be included in their nursing studies’ (4.8 points). Overall, they considered that ‘the game was enjoyable’ (4.6 points), ‘helped them in the exam’ (4.6 points), and ‘motivated them to study’ (4.5 points). Conclusions: The ‘Escape Room’ is a useful game; it stimulates learning, is fun to play, and motivates studying. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd";"02606917";52;"Spain";"Scopus"

A motivational model emerges from several research studies providing teachers with an opportunity to view the use of extrinsic rewards in the context of learners to build intrinsic motivation. Special education is a distinctive education provision for students with disabilities and disorders. It encourages academic progress and personal and social development. It aims to enhance the behavior of the students through giving reinforcements and many different teaching methods and strategies. An increasingly part of the daily activities of students of all ages is computer games. It can be challenging to implement in the classroom because there were researches that have been shown that it can support student motivation and learning. In this study, the researchers examine the principles of engagement from games designed for entertainment, apply these principles to the design of learning activities and present a model of learning engagement. Incorporating gamification elements into exceptional learners’ environments can motivate and support student achievement. The user acceptability test was used to determine the proficiency of the system. To test the acceptability of the system, the researchers floated an acceptability questionnaire to stakeholders where the target user enjoys exploring the content of the system.

Likewise, health professionals' beliefs affect their advice and attitudes towards patients' treatment, becoming a possible cause of greater disability. The development of educational interventions based on the best scientific evidence in neurophysiology of pain could be a way to provide information and advice to primary care health professionals to change their cognition towards chronic non-specific low back pain. The use of Information and Communication Technologies allows the development of web sites, which might be one of the effective resources to modify misbeliefs and attitudes, in relation to the origin and meaning of non-specific chronic low back pain, of primary care professionals and that may modify their attitudes in patients' treatment. Methods: The aim of this project is to identify misbeliefs and attitudes of primary care physicians and nurses about chronic non-specific low back pain to develop a web-based educational tool using different educational formats and gamification techniques. This study has a mixed-method sequential exploratory design. The participants are medical and nursing staff working in primary care centers in the city of Lleida, Spain. For the qualitative phase of this study, the authors will use personal semi-structured interviews. For the quantitative phase the authors will use an experimental study design. Subjects will be randomly allocated using a simple random sample technique. The intervention group will have access to the web site where they will find information related to non-specific chronic low back pain, based on the information obtained in the qualitative phase. The control group will have access to a video explaining the clinical practice guidelines on low back pain. Discussion: This study has been designed to explore and modify the beliefs and attitudes about chronic low back pain of physicians and nurses working in primary care settings, using a web-based educational tool with different educational formats and gamification techniques. The aim of the educational intervention is to change their knowledge about the origin and meaning of pain, with the result of reducing their misbeliefs and attitudes of fear avoidance.

The design of the study utilized a descriptive perspective and a cross-sectional quantitative focus through a quantitative exploratory study. For data collection, an ad hoc questionnaire was utilized, which was administered to a sample of 232 teachers-in-training. The main result obtained was that the future early childhood education professionals considered that gamification could be a resource for the learning of specific mathematics contents, and this was shaped around a model of two elements. On one hand, the development of mathematical thinking, and on the other, the establishment of relationships between mathematical concepts.

This new approach is in the form of a knowledge management system (KMS) model with the addition of elements derived from games or better known as gamification. The study began with a review of related research and studying papers that have been published by other researchers. Based on the results of learning, we found a gap in the absence of a KMS model that can be used by research managers in higher education institutions to increase the research output. First, we study the existing KMS models and related previous researches. Furthermore we added several elements that came from games into the proposed KMS model. Adding elements that came from games expected can increase the motivation of researchers to be more productive, which in turn can increase the research output in HEI. We compare elements that came from games and elements came from the previous KMS model. The result of the brief comparison shows the elements came from games more dynamic then elements came from previous KMS model. The elements that came from games much better in some ways, such as has the ability to display differences in performance between one researcher to others and can be implemented in many fields. In further research, we will conduct testing and evaluation of the proposed KMS model, involving researchers from higher education institutions. © BEIESP.";"22498958";3;"Indonesia";"Scopus"

Education 4.0 builds on the concept of learning by doing, in which students are encouraged to learn and discover different things in singular ways based on experimentation. This study intends to analyze the role of emerging technologies like serious games and industry 4.0 in the transformation of education 4.0 in higher education. A qualitative methodology was employed based on 25 case studies of innovative projects in Portuguese higher education institutions. The results indicate a residual adoption of serious games and gamification approaches only appear in less than 20% of the projects. It was also possible to identify that most projects involve several stakeholders such as teachers, students and university managers, and typically involve multidisciplinary competencies fields. The main benefits brought to the education context include greater involvement of students in projects, development of their skills and its application in a real context. On the other hand, the main challenges are the simplification of the real world made by these applications, the difficulties inherent to their inclusion in the didactical system and the limited capacities to offer greater interactivity without predefined external stimuli. © 2019, Anadolu University, Faculty of Communication Sciences.

The empirical part of the work is devoted to the study of kindergarten as a special life world for children. Special attention is paid to the description of the data collection method - interview-game, which I consider an adequate method for studying the children opinions. The methodical aspects of the interview-game usage are described. Analysis shows that children turn out to be unique ""experts"" of the world of childhood who, through a specially constructed conversation, can tell about their activity in the kindergarten and about their ideas for changing educational practices. Children emphasize importance of free playing with peers during the day, the specificity of care practices (eating and sleeping), the interaction tactics between the teacher and children, make their suggestions for creating more comfortable conditions in the kindergarten. Children turn out to be very creative innovators of practices to reconstruct the space of a kindergarten and to change the teacher's role and rules of communication. Our research shows that the grains of these ideas must be seriously and systematically collected to fully comprehend what the child wants to say.

Educational mobile games is the use of mobile game applications for enhancing the learning process. Recently, this topic has been getting a lot of attention from many scholars. However, the amount of research undertaken on mobile gamification is still limited. One of the main problems that hinder the success of mobile gamification is sustainability. Designers might overlook some important factors that increase the sustainability of learning due to lack of models that covers all the essential factors to achieve this goal. Therefore, this study proposes a new model that aims to enhance the learning sustainability using mobile gamification applications. This research provides empirical evidence and explains some important factors, such as enjoyment, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, behavioural intention to use, efficiency and effectiveness, to facilitate the effective utilization of mobile gamification applications, and thus, will contribute in increasing the sustainability of learning effectively using mobile game applications. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

This review identifies interventions that use social media to promote nutrition, examines their content and features, and evaluates the evidence for the use of such platforms among these groups. Material and methods: We conducted a systematic search of 5 databases (PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and ACM Digital Library) for studies that included: 1) adolescents and/or young adults (ages 10–19; ages 18–25); 2) a nutrition education or behavior change intervention component, or outcomes related to nutrition knowledge or dietary changes; and 3) a social media component that allowed users to communicate or share information with peers. Results: 16 articles were identified that included a social media component in a nutrition-related intervention for adolescents or young adults. Interventions included features in 7 categories: social media; communication; tracking health; education; tailoring; social support; and gamification. 11 out of the 16 studies had at least one significant nutrition-related clinical or behavioral outcome. Conclusion: Social media is a promising feature for nutrition interventions for adolescents and young adults. A limited number of studies were identified that included social media. A majority of the identified studies had positive outcomes. We found that most studies utilized only basic social media features, did not evaluate the efficacy of social media components, and did not differentiate between the efficacy of social media compared to other delivery mechanisms. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.";"13865056";21;"United States";"Scopus"

Gamification in the classroom consists in the use of the game designed mechanically and structurally to teach through game(s). It is important to note the difference between a game and gamification. A game, which is understood as a finished product and something concrete, unlike the gamification part of a didactic content which may be defined as an activity that contains the elements found in a spirit of play. Through this innovative methodology, effort is rewarded and valued, not only achievement, through the use of badges. Through this methodology, the game is treated as a motivating element in the classroom, and moreover it is a methodology which is considered as an active one because the student must be active and be the main character in the learning process. METHOD. This work involves the translation and validation of a GAMEX scale (Gameful Experience in Gamification) that measures the gamified experience in English and German. The sample consists of 224 participants related to education and gamified experiences (52% teachers and 48% students). Exploratory factor analysis (AFE) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were carried out to confirm the dimensional structure of the scale. RESULTS. The results show the complexity of evaluating gamified experiences from a unique and valid perspective, since several dimensions come into play. There are valid instruments that do not take into account all dimensions, and this proposed instrument shows a higher acceptable level of adjustment than the original model. DISCUSSION. The multi-dimensional nature of the gamified experience is emphasized and the need to create an instrument to evaluate it and improve future gamified experiences is highlighted. © Sociedad Española de Pedagogía.";"02105934";NA;"Spain";"Scopus"

The empirical approach is used to analyze the experiential education project Robot Heart Stories, developed in 2011 in Canada and the United States. The theoretical framework focuses on the conceptualization of transmedia storytelling in the scope of education and the examination of the implications of gamification in this scenario. The methodological approach of the case study is based on the transmedia project design analytical model and applied to Robot Heart Stories to depict how the project was developed and demonstrate how transmedia strategies can potentially enhance education. The research findings point out that the transmedia strategies in the project placed the students in the center of the learning process and motivated them to learn. As the students were actual characters in the story, they had the opportunity to experience it, instead of just listening or reading it. The project nurtured skills, such as multimodal literacy, critical literacy, digital literacy, media literacy, visual literacy, information literacy, and game literacy, in addition to interpersonal communication skills and experiential learning. © 2016 International Council for Educational Media.";"09523987";4;"Russia";"Scopus"

Gamification is growing rapidly in the world of online education, with more and more educational institutions adopting elements of the game. With the game based education not only for students, but also for lecturers who are motivated because they get rewards. Even though gamification education plays an important role in online learning, there is no literature from the lecturer side that explains the benefits of applying gamification in the context of responsibility for giving student test scores and their impact on their attitude towards test scores. This study discusses the lecturer's negligence in providing test scores that are not timely using the viewboard method in the context of gamification. Viewboard and gamification are a combination that can provide solutions in the technology literature in the millennial era. With the viewboard, this research presents information visualization that examines the impact of gamification on the intention of lecturers to be involved in it and their attitude towards student test scores. Quantitative methodology is used which results in empirical support for the benefits obtained by increasing the motivation of lecturers. However, the paradigm of the system used is still found between the intentions of lecturers to be involved in the gamification process in granting student test scores not yet significant.

Design/methodology/approach: The use of the LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® (LSP) method in the context of transformative learning in Higher Education was used to drive a Situational analysis with sixteen postgraduate nursing students, from African learning contexts. This methodological approach was used to specifically explore their identity as learners and then to facilitate processes of critical introspection on social constructivist learning opportunities. Findings: Students’ perceived LSP permitted a deeper level of critical introspection on their transformative learning journeys than alternative approaches, such as written discourse or extended narratives, could have provided. They also perceived that a major benefit of using the LSP method was that it enabled them to understand and articulate their stories more easily than if they verbally reported them first. Research limitations/implications: The sampling the authors used was purposive and reflective of the Nigerian background of our research participants, who study at the University of Sunderland. Practical implications: LSP was perceived as an effective vehicle for the facilitation of reflection and self-awareness, which consequently contribute to students’ capacities to function at a metacognitive level. This has the potential to contribute to authentic transformative learning. Academic learning at postgraduate level hinged on the capacity of students to develop a pragmatic and working knowledge of what acknowledging their epistemic cognition entailed. Originality/value: The methodological approach implemented in this paper provides a unique means of harnessing a now common gamification technique in pedagogic practice. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.";"20423896";1;"United Kingdom";"Scopus"

For this study, a lesson plan has been developed to relate Writing and Authorship Skills lesson to the gamification for middle school students. From this lesson plan, it was tried to determine the effectiveness of the teaching process. Therefore, the study was designed as action research. The research group is composed of seventh grade students. Criteria sampling technique was used to determine the participants. As a data collection tool, student diary, semi-structured interview form, semi-structured observation form, digital content of the students were used. Data obtained from the semi-structured interview form were analyzed by content analysis; other data were analyzed by descriptive analysis. Writing skills and gamification were related in the study. Turkish Language Teaching Program (2018) has been taken into consideration in the action plan which relates to gamification and writing skill. As a result of the study, it was seen that all participants were actively involved in the implementation process. In addition, it was concluded that gamification increased the interest of students towards the course, combined school and non-school life, facilitated classroom management, supported collaborative work, and developed creativity. As a result of this study, it is suggested that digital games can be used as a text type in Turkish language lessons with the method of gamification in order to positively affect motivation of the middle school students toward writing education. © 2019, Anadolu University, Faculty of Communication Sciences.

However, the subject of physical education has now become a permeable space for including technological devices, despite the fact that there is some resistance to their incorporation into the classes. This is mainly due fears of the risk derived either from their misuse or because some schools are unable to make the investment in certain devices. This paper describes an innovative experience with mobile devices as gamifying elements in the field of physical education in higher education, by which we aimed to show the symbiotic effect of the use of technology as a facilitator of the practice of physical activity. The study also indicated that it is not necessary to provide each student with an individual device in order to obtain reliable data, as well as suitable procedures for the participants’ assessment procedures. After performing different analyses based on a positivist research paradigm, we found that the experience was positively valued by the students and that the daily recommendations for moderate physical activity were improved. The validity and reliability tests confirmed that one device for every two students would be enough provide useful information regarding the students’ physical demands. Incorporating technology in PE lessons has thus been shown to be satisfactory for the students.It not only favoured the fulfilment of the recommendations on physical activity but also obtainedvalid and reliable information withoutrequiring all the students to have their own individual device. © JPES.";"22478051";1;"Spain";"Scopus"

Lecturers can measure how well students absorb information and tailor their teaching to the next step or re-teach a concept after poor uptake by students. Seventy-two students participated in a 20-question survey about their experiences with ‘KAHOOT!’. Engagement scores were correlated with assessment grades to measure if ‘KAHOOT!’ affected student learning and achievement. The survey was deemed statistically sound in reliability and validity testing, and a principal components analysis (PCA) revealed that the attributes were strongly linked. There was no relationship between engagement score and assessment grade, indicating that ‘KAHOOT’!’ did not directly increase achievement. However, assessment of individual responses identified that students found it to be a positive social learning technology as it provided a fun, competitive and immersive end to a class. The benefits of fostering engagement, enjoyment and immersion within adult learning are especially important for maintaining a level of achievement within education to ensure that students are better equipped to deal with challenges and can turn a potential failure into an opportunity to improve their scholarship. The challenge provided by this study is to identify now how to measure the value of ‘fun’ activities in the tertiary classroom as a reinforcer for engagement, participation and learning. © 2019 K.E.

Materials and Methods. The methodology of the study is composed by the analysis of psychological, pedagogical, methodological and technical literature, computer educational games of foreign and native authors whose authority and scientific reputation are recognized by the scientific community. Observation methods (structured, unstructured, participant observation) were also used, in particular observation of the educational process and observation of the students' activities. The methods of research are determined by its goals, tasks of a particular stage, conceptual approaches implemented in the study, which provide the necessary depth of studying the main aspects of the problem. Results. On the base of the history of informatization of Russian education, the practice of introducing computer games into the learning process and the methodological conception of gamification of educational process, the opportunities provided by the inclusion of a computer and other IT tools in the learning process are analyzed. The necessarily of improving the methodology of computer games using is substantiated by the analysis of the positive and negative aspects of including computer games in the educational process as a whole and, in particular, in the process of teaching computer science in the conditions of changing the paradigm of cognition, where the priority attention is paid to the formation of unique skills of distributed (foresight) intellection. The article suggests recommendations for improving the efficiency of the educational process when computer games are included in training, finding the best balance between two differently directed positions and preserving ergonomics in the framework of the system-activity and personality-oriented approach to learning. Conclusions. The article proves the expediency of a new approach to the gamification of the educational process, aimed to form a new game style of thinking prepared not only for finding nonstandard solutions, but for strategically verified solutions, suitable for use in the real world. © 2011-2017 NSPU Bulletin.";"22263365";9;"Russia";"Scopus"

Problems of social and environmental nature, requirements for providing high-quality support for online education have revealed new conditions for implementation, difficulties and prospects for learning at a distance. The authors suggest using game technologies for managing information interaction in the classroom to support motivation, activate cognition, involve students in collaborative work, and control attendance. Method of research. Theoretical and methodological analysis and generalization of fundamental scientific works on the research problem, processing of the results of control measures and the content of the ClassDojo service (forms, thank-you letters, stickers, posters) are used. The authors took into account the provisions of the system-activity, personality-oriented and communicative approaches. The pedagogical experiment involved 48 students (75% of girls and 25% of boys) from the ""Lyceum of Natural Sciences"", Kirov. The G-signs criterion was used as a statistical processing method. Results. The features of online learning based on game technologies for managing information interaction through the ClassDojo service are formulated: the content of the educational material is focused on the peculiarities of perception of the modern schoolchild, the inclusion of mobile services activates cognitive interest, supports research and communication practice, intensifies the process of mutual assistance in the group. The empirical value of Gemp=3 less than Gcr=8 (for p=0.01) confirms that the shift towards improving the quality of educational results after using the ClassDojo game service is not accidental. Conclusion. The inclusion of game technologies to support class management in online-learning will help improve the quality of educational results while providing a set of conditions: activation of knowledge, connecting students to information interaction in new ways, expanding the classroom beyond the school walls, changing the roles of participants in the didactic process, the use of mobile applications. © 2020 LLC Ecological Help.

Gamification strategies can be an effective way to provide students with timely feedback regarding their progress toward professional educator dispositions. This study investigated the effectiveness of points, timely feedback, and leaderboards on cultivating and measuring specific professional educator dispositions among preservice teachers. Data was collected in four domains - personal responsibility, intellectual engagement, professional ethics and stewardship, and supportive interactions- where gamification strategies were additively implemented over five semesters. Results from this study indicate gamification strategies, when bundled together to leverage motivating factors such as competition and personalization led to increased gains in the four domains of professional educator dispositions. © 2019 IGI Global.";"21556849";NA;"United States";"Scopus"

Changes in the technological and social conditions of modern society need new professional skills, which are often called ""21st century skills"". These skills should be developed starting from the primary school, as they are psychological and behavioural, rather than practical. Game-based learning and gamification are effective means of such skills development. The use of video games in teaching practice is studied multifaceted, along with formats and requirements of educational game, methods for effectiveness assessment, and the effect of games on students. The controversial nature of game-based learning effect on students require deeper research, as the increase in motivation and learning efficiency cannot be disputed, as well as the negative impact of a long gaming on cognitive abilities, emotional state and social skills of students. The study tested both an increase in the motivation and attraction of school students for the learning process, and the impact on the practical results of information assimilation. There was conducted a survey on the results of the application of game training to determine the motivation and attraction of students. Likewise, we counted time, spent by the study and control group, for mastering the main educational material and the post-class study of game content and the educational material it presents. A comparative test was conducted on the results of educational material comprehension to determine the effectiveness of the methodology in mastering knowledge. The group, with game-based learning and gamification applied, showed an increase in motivation and attraction to learning, students paid additional efforts for assimilating the material studied, and also showed significantly higher learning outcomes compared to the control group. © Kassel University Press GmbH.";"18688799";4;"Russia";"Scopus"

However, if teachers themselves are not motivated, or if they lack a positive attitude towards implementing these new methodologies, it will be dificult for students to feel motivated when approaching said resources. Therefore, it is important to know what teachers' attitudes towards them are. The aim of this research is the creation of an attitudes scale towards collaborative learning with video games, aimed at in-service primary school teachers. Different methodological steps were followed that made its construction possible, such as the analysis of items and the verification of their reliability, resulting in a rigorous attitudes scale of 33 items, with a reliability of α = 0.947.

The specific goals include: description of the main features of wearable computing from the perspective of its potential usefulness in libraries; analysis of areas of wearable computing use in public institutions; discussion of the potential of wearable computing for library users; and discussion of the potential of wearable computing for librarians to determine its potential in libraries to meet the needs of users and librarians. Design/methodology/approach: The method of subject literature overview was used. The state of research from the period 2008 to 2018 on the use of wearable computing in libraries was established based on a search of selected sources Web of Science, Scopus, Elsevier and Emerald databases and LISTA database. Findings: Wearable computing can be used in many areas of library activities to serve the needs of users and librarians. In the context of services for users, wearable computing can be used, among others, to help users navigate the library, to provide resources in new and interesting forms, and in education and entertainment. For the needs of librarians, additional data provided via wearable devices can accelerate the process of cataloguing resources and increase motivation to work via gamification options and features that make it possible to measure personal work efficiency. Librarians can also use the data obtained wearable computing devices to more quickly track, identify, select and organize resources. As with users, librarians can also use wearable computing in their education. Research limitations/implications: The paper is a viewpoint based on subject literature. It presents only a sketch of potential wearable computing applications in libraries. The aim of the paper is to initiate further discussion on the possibilities of using wearable devices to improve both services for users and internal library processes. The author’s hope is that the concepts presented here will be tested in practice by librarians, which will allow further development of research on this subject. Practical implications: The results can be widely used in practice as a framework for the implementation of wearable computing solutions in libraries. Social implications: The paper can help to facilitate the debate on the role of the implementation of new technologies in libraries.

Similarities and differences of the methods between ""gamification"" and ""games"" (as well as ""gamification"" and ""game based learning"") have also been look upon up until now. However, ""gamification"" and ""game"" terms, are still being mentioned as substitutes for one another sometimes in many research articles. Although a mixture of methods are being used nowadays in the whole learning process (e.g. flipped learning together with gamification, mobile learning and infographics etc.), naming the ""whole"" learning methodology being used in an educational project/research only as ""gamification"" (or only as a game/GBL) - is yet another common issue that may lead us to misunderstand the gamification concept. These situations may be regarded as problematic issues in understanding the concept of gamification correctly. The number of educators and researchers keeps increasing in the world which are researching and trying to benefit from gamification applications in a variety of disciplines. Some of these disciplines (such as chemistry, health etc.) seems to be more benefitting and being more successful than others in their project states. Evaluating the level of success in various dimensions of learning may also differ from one to another largely in case of mixed learning methods being used in the research. Thus, in cases of using gamification method as well with others in a mixed manner of methods, the low level of success achieved may have been affected by a number of reasons. These reasons and conclusions have oriented the author to establish a research on articles and web resources on ""gamificaiton"" and its differentiations from ""games"" and ""game-based learning"" concepts.

Based on continued research, however, the badge began to be recognized as a scale to measure the learner's knowledge and skill and an important means of helping learners to gradually build intrinsic motivation by using certain extrinsic motivators. As the badge's value has grown, the importance of its design has garnered attention. Objective: The objective of this research was to establish a badge design framework that can be used in a gamified learning environment. Methods: Data were collected from previous studies on badge design, 943 badge cases were extracted from 11 online and offline gamification in education contents, and their patterns and features were analyzed. Results: Based on the analysis of results from previous studies and 943 collected badge cases, our study suggests three conditions for badge design. Through the literature review and collected badge cases, our study designed a badge design framework. First, it is necessary to distinguish whether the type of learning activity required for earning badges is physical or conceptual. Second, it is necessary to distinguish whether the scale of an activity required for earning badges requires individual learning or interaction-induced learning. Third, it is important to review whether the time and effort invested in earning badges is simple, repetitive, and short-term or continuous and long-term. Based on these three conditions, collected badge cases were analyzed. To verify self-developed badge types, we conducted a chi-square test on the collected cases and confirmed that there was a significant difference for each of the eight badge types (Pearson chi-square 1117.7, P<.001). Conclusions: Through its literature review on previous studies, this study demonstrated the badge's educational effectiveness. The badge design framework suggested in our study is expected to resolve some of the difficulties experienced during the badge design process in a gamified learning environment, encourage efficient badge design, and maximize learning effect.";"22919279";2;"Canada";"Web of Science"

As a research discipline, gamification is growing fast, maturing from basic and fundamental questions such as what and why gamify to more mature ones such as how to gamify, when and when not, and still facing empirical and theoretical challenges to prove the effects of its practice and consolidate the principles that guide meaningful gamification designs. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a bibliometric study to describe how gamification as a scientific discipline is structured and how it has evolved over time. To do this, we make use of bibliometric performance analysis and science mapping methods to display and analyze the intellectual, conceptual and social network structures of gamification research, as well as the evolution and dynamical aspects of the discipline. The results reveal the research fronts and intellectual structures of the field, the internal relationships among articles, authors and keywords, the existing networks of collaboration, the emerging trends, the hot topics, and the most influential authors, publications and sources.

The duration of the study lasted an entire school year. The central theories underpinning flipped learning with gamification design were based on the first principles of Instruction and self-determination theory. A mixed methods approach was used with quantitative (i.e., tests and an optional assignment) and qualitative (i.e., student interviews) methods applied. The test results indicate that students in the flipped class (n = 28) significantly outperformed those in the traditional (n = 27) and online independent study (n = 21) classes. In addition, flipped learning with gamification promoted students' cognitive engagement better than the other two approaches. The findings of student interviews suggest that peer interactions inside the flipped classroom were critical to promoting students' mathematics achievement and cognitive engagement, as opposed to online learning resources and gamification per se.

This paper presents an exercise on developing and testing a computer game which introduces players to the basic concepts of building energy performance. A software application was developed to visualise post-occupancy evaluation data in a dynamic three-dimensional context. A pilot study was used for assessing and fine-tuning the methodology, followed by the main study of two workshops with two different user groups: non-experts and entry-level specialists. The results are presented using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The findings suggest that the advantages and challenges of 'gamification' described in the literature are generally confirmed by the tentative evidence of this exercise. In addition, the process highlights the potential of novel ways of presenting building data in enabling more stakeholders to engage with the issue of building energy performance.";"14784629";2;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

This research attempts to analyze the concept of gamification and its components, types of players, and conditions for successful design by reviewing the literature. In addition, the research aims to investigate how the gamification design process can be used in education and what empirical effects are expected. The research also aims to propose a conceptual framework for gamification integration in eLearning systems based on the instructional design (ID) model. The methodology used in the identification of successful strategies and experiences is based on reviewing the literature that explains gamification, game strategies, and previous gamification frameworks. Examples and suggestions of gamification are included. The findings illustrate the potential techniques for applying gamification in eLearning systems, especially e-courses. The differences between Digital Games, gamebased learning, and gamification are discussed. The findings propose a conceptual framework for gamification integration in eLearning systems based on the ID Model. Gamification has been incorporated into the general phases of the ID model, namely, analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. The findings help decision-makers and stakeholders at higher education institutions differentiate between games, game-based learning, and gamification integration into education and determine suitable ID models as conceptual frameworks for systematically delivering learning content through gamification.";"18630383";0;"Germany";"Web of Science"

In an effort to make the assessments more fun, researchers have started to introduce game elements to traditional cognitive tasks and training. This comes with a number of challenges. The main challenge is to develop an engaging tool that at the same time reliably assesses cognitive constructs in students. To address these challenges, this research aims to improve cognitive assessment with a new game-based assessment app that has been designed and developed in collaboration with researchers, teachers, students, and software engineers based on established cognitive theories, and subsequently validated through iterative testing in real world settings. The iterative development process is based on design-based research and includes cycles of design explorations, testing, analyses, redesign, and evaluation with students in authentic educational settings. The knowledge gained from the iterative process of designing a valid cognitive function app can inform other researchers who are aiming to develop cognitive assessment tools in an educational context.";"23848766";1;"Italy";"Web of Science"

Increasingly sophisticated technological systems are steering societies into a new era that makes technology a very important tool. Children's minds are highly susceptible to technology enabling them to become skilful in using gadgets and in surfing the internet. However, the teaching and learning in classrooms still adopt traditional or conventional methods. This paper aims to critically examine the development of the portable application named Global Zakat Game (GZG) as one of the initiatives to help increase the level of education in Malaysia so that it will be in line with the development of information technology and communication today. The use of this application will also help teachers to disseminate universal values such as charity and raise awareness of issues such as the quest for peace both within the nation and globally, among people of different nations. A qualitative methodology was employed to analyse data using the inductive and deductive approach. The findings show that the GZG application could help students to understand the values of charity in zakat well, although it is only played online. This is because GZG encompasses almost the whole zakat syllabus including types of zakat, the rate of zakat, the calculation of zakat, and questions related to zakat. The education system should not lag behind in the use of technology and should upgrade its teaching-learning methodologies in line with the increasing sophistication of technology today. Through modern education awareness of global peace and values such as charity can be instilled and inculcated in the young. This paper suggests that through the teaching and learning of zakat using the portable applications GZG, global peace awareness and other relevant values could be successfully inculcated among students.";"13946870";0;"Malaysia";"Web of Science"

Materials and Methods: An interactive computer module (Interactive Module to Halt Abuse of Prescriptions in Preteens and Youth [I'M HAPPY]) was created using a combination of e-learning and animation software. The module used narrated illustrations, animations, and games to explain what over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription drugs are, how they are used correctly, and what risks they carry. Animated drug refusal scenarios with user-determined outcomes were also incorporated. Sixth-grade students were asked to complete the module online and were given a 14-question pretest and posttest on the definitions, adverse effects, and proper use of OTC and prescription medicines. They were also asked to rank the perceived helpfulness of several drug refusal strategies. Student opinions about the computer module itself were collected on the posttest. Results: Students (n = 34) scored better on quiz questions following the module. They also showed increased favorability toward three of four drug refusal strategies after completing the module, with a greater proportion ranking these strategies Very Helpful. Most students indicated they learned new things from the module (79%) and found it enjoyable (88%) and easy to use (97%).

This study explores promoting motivation in a distance education, third-year computer programming course via a gamified approach to improve coursework participation and student experience. Motivation was examined from a Self-Determination Theory (SDT) perspective, as gamified approaches often rely on external motivation and the explicit use of competition to engender internal motivation leading to desired behaviours. The results of using gamification in education are mixed, and its use is controversial. Two cycles of action research on the introduction of eight playful elements are reported on, and data relating to student engagement with the course and a student questionnaire was gathered. There was little evidence that the intervention led to behaviour change or improved scores; however, students responded very positively to the intervention, although some negative themes emerged. The extent to which the playful approach supported the basic psychological needs of SDT is discussed and the intervention's results critically considered, including whether the effort involved in such an approach was worth it. It was concluded that such playful approaches might have positive motivational effects.";"14923831";5;"Canada";"Web of Science"

This has proven to be a bad idea in some cases, for the simple reason that practice is required to learn basic arithmetic skills. Drills in arithmetic skills can be made interesting through gamification. This study proposes a family of puzzles that gamify arithmetic practice. The puzzles are designed with an evolutionary algorithm forming an instance of automatic content generation. Two methods of evolutionary puzzle design are presented and discussed. The first method used transformed the problem into an almost trivial optimization. The second algorithm was designed to avoid the flaws of the first and produced a huge variety of puzzles. A hardness measure, based on the difficulty experienced by the evolutionary puzzle generator, is employed. The hardness measure is tested on a large collection of puzzles produced with the evolutionary automatic content generation system. An initial assumption, that all the pieces in the puzzle must be used to achieve a maximum score, was shown to be incorrect in puzzles located via automatic search. Two classes of puzzle are defined: those where the optimal solution uses all pieces and those where the optimal solution fails to use at least one piece. The latter sort of puzzle were found to be far more common in the search space.";"13896911";0;"Netherlands";"Web of Science"

We propose machine learning algorithm -based personalized content selection to address a part of this problem and present a process for creating personalized designs that allows automating a part of the implementation. The process is based on Deterding's 2015 framework for gameful design, the lens of intrinsic skill atoms, with additional steps for selecting a personalization strategy and algorithm creation. We then demonstrate the process by implementing personalized gamification for a computer-supported collaborative learning environment. For this demonstration, we use the gamification user type hexad for personalization and the heuristics for effective design of gamification for overall design.

Methods: The authors designed a role-playing simulation activity that aims to highlight the multidimensional nature of health and develop in students an appreciation of the day-to-day experiences of underserved populations. The current investigation aimed to evaluate the utility of the role-playing activity and guided reflection in terms of the students' appreciation of economic factors that affect health and health-seeking behavior of patients and their recognition of the role of healthcare professionals with respect to issues related to poverty and health. Thematic analyses of the insights and observations of the students immediately after the activity and the anonymized reflection papers were done to identify recurring ideas that made an impression on them. Results: The students were able to identify that in a setting with limited employment opportunities and low-income potential, the residents prioritized food and shelter over everything else. They also chose cheaper products over healthier options. Practically everyone forewent out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure in order to minimize its disruptive consequences. In these settings, the students highlighted the role of society and government in the provision of services and in community development. The students also emphasized the necessity for competition among a number of providers of goods and services to reduce prices. When asked if healthcare professionals are contributing to the widening gap between rich and poor, 70% agreed, 9% disagreed, 14% did not give a direct answer, and 7% said that healthcare professionals contributed in some ways and alleviated in other ways. The most commonly cited behavior that contribute to this disparity are the decision to seek highly specialized training, the congregation of practitioners in highly urbanized centers, and inattention to the economic difficulties of most patients. Those who disagreed with the statement cited systemic problems as the driving force that widens the disparity. In particular, these students cited the commodification of healthcare and related services, inappropriate policies, and insufficient funding specifically for services and health human resources. Conclusion: The evolving landscape in healthcare financing requires more preparation among our medical students and trainees. Innovative strategies such as role-playing activities and guided reflection are useful in demonstrating economic factors that influence health and promote better understanding of externalities that shape the health status of individuals and communities.";"11797258";0;"New Zealand";"Web of Science"

This scoping review aimed to assess the evidence regarding the value of gamification as part of health science undergraduate education, in comparison to conventional teaching curriculum. Methods: A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMC are and Cochrane databases. Articles were eligible if they were randomised controlled trials comparing the use of gamification for undergraduate health profession students, with conventional teaching methods. Outcomes included knowledge (ie., information acquisition), skills (ie., knowledge application) and perceived benefit. Screening, data extraction and critical appraisal was conducted by two reviewers independently. Results: Eleven RCT studies were included (n = 997). Three of eight reporting studies discovered significant findings for knowledge acquisition scores favouring the intervention group. Varying results were demonstrated in the skills domain across six studies. Perceived benefits including student motivation and satisfaction levels demonstrated positive findings in all but one of six reporting studies. Discussion: Educators should supplement methods with gamified learning rather than replace them, consider group-based gamification, and employ methods at irregular intervals. Conclusion: The findings of this review suggest that gamification may be advantageous for health science undergraduates. Gamification positively impacts student satisfaction and motivation, though its capacity to enhance students' knowledge acquisition and application necessitates further research.";"19398654";0;"USA";"Web of Science"

Decisions between marketing and finance professionals must be reinforced, to allow academic organizations involved in developing markets and characterized by low levels of competitiveness improve their education levels.";"10468781";1;"USA";"Web of Science"

E-learning system involves digital content development, administration, and delivery of learning contents that can be made available even to remote locations. In the advent of huge digital content available on the internet, an effective e-learning system requires collaboration among the content creators, users, and administrators, further, it requires huge computational power and storage capacity. Presently, the system focuses mostly on the delivery of content to learners rather than concentrating on the effective storage and efficient retrieval of the content based on the skill of the individual learners. Several approaches have been attempted towards the personalised content delivery based on the basic skill of learners. However, the system maintained a repository of verified contents relatively than a validated content. In order to maintain a validated content for efficient retrieval, distributed models with respect to a different perspective of validation may be fruitful. This paper studied various distributed models that are developed in the domain of e-learning with respect to the learning environment, learning objects and learning style.";"1741847X";0;"Switzerland";"Web of Science"

The advance of information and communications technology drives many researchers to explore the development of web-based instruction. Students encountering problems in the learning processes is not necessarily the lack of learning ability, but the inappropriate match between teachers' teaching methods and students' thinking and learning methods. Immutable instruction and assessment methods might benefit some students with certain thinking types and learning styles, but are unfavorable for others. This study intends to discuss the correlation between thinking styles and academic achievement in Web-Based Environmental Education. The quasi-experimental research with experimental design is adopted in this study, and two classes from Southwest University of Science and Technology is proceeded the experimental teaching. After retrieving the research data, the research results are summarized as below. 1. Environmental Education would affect learning achievement. 2. Environmental Education would influence learning retention. 3. Thinking styles present significantly positive effects on learning effect in academic achievement. 4. Thinking styles show remarkably positive effects on learning gain in academic achievement. Suggestions based on the results are further proposed in this study, expecting to help activate classroom climate, improve instruction, and implement the promotion of teaching quality in order to correspond to the rationale and spirit of educational reform.";"13001361";1;"Turkey";"Web of Science"

Gamification in higher education can provide to students better opportunities to develop commitment skills, increasing their motivation and making them more interested in what they are learning. The purpose of this review is to collect information, synthesize and integrate published works on the influence of gamification with the motivation and learning of students. With this, it is intended to establish the current state of knowledge on gamification in education, which will allow a better approach to future lines of research. Representative studies were identified through a systematic search in 4 databases: EBSCO SPORTDISCUS, SCOPUS, ISI and SCHOLAR GOOGLE, extracting data about the study design, participants, variables, instruments and results. We included 22 studies, 19 originals and 3 reviews of the literature. Initial evidence indicates that gamification in higher education motivates students and improves their learning, providing university students with better opportunities to develop commitment skills. The use of PBL (Points, Badges and Leaderboards) improves motivation and is considered as an adequate combination of mechanics in the implementation of any gamification process in higher education.

While many fields such as Business, Marketing and e-Learning have taken advantage of the potential of gamification, the digital healthcare domain has also started to exploit this emerging trend. This paper aims to summarize the current knowledge regarding gamified e-Health applications. A systematic literature review was therefore conducted to explore the various gamification strategies employed in e-Health and to address the benefits and the pitfalls of this emerging discipline. A total of 46 studies from multiple sources were then considered and thoroughly investigated. The results show that the majority of the papers selected reported gamification and serious gaming in health and wellness contexts related specifically to chronic disease rehabilitation, physical activity and mental health. Although gamification in e-Health has attracted a great deal of attention during the last few years, there is still a dearth of valid empirical evidence in this field. Moreover, most of the e-Health applications and serious games investigated have been proven to yield solely short-term engagement through extrinsic rewards. For gamification to reach its full potential, it is therefore necessary to build e-Health solutions on well-founded theories that exploit the core experience and psychological effects of game mechanics.

Thus, this carries out a survey of the state of the art of existing and documented approaches in the literature, through a mapping of published works in the last five years (2012 to 2016) in two of Brazil's leading scientific computing platforms (CEIE and RENOTE), whose focus is to present solutions that address methodologies and tools that can be used in the different teaching modalities. As methodology was used the Systematic Review of Literature. As a result, it was found that, although studies still focus on higher education, in recent years there has been an increasing interest in programming teaching projects for children and teenagers, using gamification and tools such as Scratch.

Since nudging is a new concept, no review of literature on nudging diabetic patients into improving their health behaviour has been done. Therefore, we aim to collate a list of nudge intervention and determine the context in which nudging is successful. Methods. - We adopted a two-arm search strategy comprising the search of literature databases and snowballing using relevant search terms. We summarized patient characteristics, the nudge intervention, according to nudging strategies, delivery mode and their outcomes. The conditions present in effective nudge interventions were assessed and reported. Results. - We retrieved 11,494 studies from our searches and included 33. An additional five studies were added through snowballing. Studies included utilized framing (n = 5), reminders (n = 10), gamification (n = 2), social modelling (n = 5) and social influence (n = 16). Studies on reminders and gamification were more likely to have a statistically significant outcome. The targeted health behaviours identified were medication adherence, physical activity, diet, blood glucose monitoring, foot care, self-efficacy, HbA1c and quality of life. Of these, studies with adherence to medication, foot care practice and quality of life as targeted health behaviours were more likely to show a statistically significant outcome. Conclusion. - Nudging has shown potential in changing health behaviour of patients with diabetes in specific context. We identified two possible factors (delivery mode and patient characteristics) that may affect the effectiveness of nudge intervention. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Nevertheless, games are not considered mainstream material in medical teaching. Two research questions that arise are the following: What pedagogical strategies do developers use when creating games for medical education? And what is the quality of the evidence on the effectiveness of games? Methods: A systematic review was made by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers following the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines. We included peer-reviewed journal articles which described or assessed the use of serious games or gamified apps in medical education. We used the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) to assess the quality of evidence in the use of games. We also evaluated the pedagogical perspectives of such articles. Results: Even though game developers claim that games are useful pedagogical tools, the evidence on their effectiveness is moderate, as assessed by the MERSQI score. Behaviourism and cognitivism continue to be the predominant pedagogical strategies, and games are complementary devices that do not replace traditional medical teaching tools. Medical educators prefer simulations and quizzes focused on knowledge retention and skill development through repetition and do not demand the use of sophisticated games in their classrooms. Moreover, public access to medical games is limited. Discussion: Our aim was to put the pedagogical strategy into dialogue with the evidence on the effectiveness of the use of medical games. This makes sense since the practical use of games depends on the quality of the evidence about their effectiveness. Moreover, recognition of said pedagogical strategy would allow game developers to design more robust games which would greatly contribute to the learning process.";"10872981";49;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

These studies were exposed to thematically content analysis via such parameters as aim, method/design, sample, data collection, data analysis, subject employed for argumentation, type of used argumentation, argumentation model, general knowledge claim and recommendation. The results indicated that most of the argumentation studies examined the effect of argumentation on student achievement and attitudes towards science. Also, these studies under investigation mostly used experimental research design while generally preferring scales and audio-video records for data collection tools. Moreover, the argumentation activities were mostly developed in 'physics' topics and middle school level. The results of the current study suggest to deploy different methods (e.g. argumentation accompanied with gamification) to improve argumentation skills from primary school level.";"13001337";13;"Turkey";"Web of Science"

Design: Quasi-experimental. Setting: Thirty-seven kindergartens from Portugal. Participants: Eight hundred seventy-seven families. Intervention: Web-based social network of participants' interactions, educational materials, apps and nutritional challenges, focused on fruit, vegetables, sugar, and salt. Main Outcome Measures: Parental nutrition literacy (self-reported survey - 4 dimensions: Nutrients, Food portions, Portuguese food wheel groups, Food labeling). Analysis: General linear model - Repeated measures was used to analyze the effect on the nutrition literacy score. Results: Families uploaded 1267 items (recipes, photographs of challenges) and educators uploaded 327 items (photographs, videos) onto the interactive platform. For the intervention group (n = 106), the final mean (SD) score of nutrition literacy was significantly higher than the baseline: 78.8% (15.6) vs 72.7% (16.2); P < .001, regardless of parental education and perceived income status. No significant differences in the scores of the control group (n = 83) were observed (final 67.8% [16.1] vs initial 66.4% [15.6]; P = .364).

The dimensions - and the user types that they refer to - are Free spirit, Socializer, Achiever, Philanthropist, Player,and Disruptor.It is the motive of this study that identifying and studying these user types may prove useful for understanding the effects of gamification dynamics and mechanics and assist in designing specific gamification techniques corresponding to each user type. The adaptation of the instrument began with translation, continued with an examination of the linguistic equivalence, and finalized with analyses of validity and reliability. The scale items were initially translated by the researchers. The translation was examined by seven experts with good English proficiency to finalize the Turkish version. To verify the linguistic equivalence, both the Turkish and English versions were then administered to 30 English Language Education (ELE) students. The correlation findings showed a high degree of correlation between the Turkish and English versions. Next, the Turkish version was administered to 452 university students studying at the Faculty of Education, Sakarya University, to check its validity and reliability. The results obtained from a confirmatory factor analysis and the reliability analysis indicate that the Turkish version of the scale is valid and reliable.

However, most of the currently available nutrition apps lack scientific evaluation and user acceptance. Objective: The objective of this study was the systematic design of a theory-driven and target group-adapted dietary mobile app concept to promote healthy eating habits with a focus on drinking habits as well as consumption of fruits and vegetables in adolescents and young adults, especially from disadvantaged backgrounds. Methods: The design process was guided by the behavior change wheel (BCW). The development process comprised 3 stages. In stage 1, the target behavior was specified, and facilitators and barriers were identified. Furthermore, important insights into target group interests, needs, and values in the field of nutrition and apps were revealed. To this end, 2 empirical studies were conducted with the target group. In stage 2, results of stage 1 were translated into behavior change techniques (BCTs) and, finally, into app functionalities and features. Consequently, in stage 3, the concept was evaluated and optimized through expert interviews. Results: Facilitators and barriers for achieving the target behavior were psychological capabilities (eg, self-efficacy), reflective motivation (eg, fitness), automatic motivation, social support, and physical opportunity (eg, time). Target group interests, needs, and values in the field of nutrition were translated into target group preferences for app usage, for example, low usage effort, visual feedback, or recipes. Education, training, incentives, persuasion, and enablement were identified as relevant intervention functions. Together with the target group preferences, these were translated via 14 BCTs, such as rewards, graded tasks, or self-monitoring into the app concept Challenge to go (C2go). The expert evaluation suggested changes of some app features for improving adherence, positive health effects, and technical feasibility. The C2go concept comprises 3 worlds: the (1) drinking, (2) vegetable, and (3) fruit worlds. In each world, the users are faced with challenges including feedback and a quiz. Tips were developed based on the health action process approach and to help users gain challenges and, thereby, achieve the target behavior. Challenges can be played alone or against someone in the community. Due to different activities, points can be collected, and levels can be achieved. Collected points open access to an Infothek (information section), where users can choose content that interests them. An avatar guides user through the app. Conclusions: C2go is aimed at adolescents and young adults and aims to improve their fruit and vegetable consumption as well as drinking habits.

Programming is difficult for students to learn, given that it includes a lot of new, complex, and abstract topics. All of this has led experts to the conclusion that new teaching techniques are required if students are to be motivated and engaged in learning on programming courses. Gamification has come to be an effective technique in education in general, and is especially useful in programming courses. This motivated us to develop an open source gamified platform, called UDPiler, for use in a programming course. Objective: The main goal of this article is to obtain empirical evidence on the improvement of students' learning performance when using UDPiler in comparison to a non-gamified compiler. Method: A quasi-experiment was performed with two groups of first-year engineering students at Diego Portales University in Chile, using a non-gamified compiler and a gamified platform, respectively. Results: The results reveal that the students obtained better marks when the gamified platform was used to learn C programming. In addition, there is statistical significance in favor of there being a positive effect on the learning performance of those students who used the gamified platform. Conclusions: The results allow us to conclude that gamification is an encouraging approach with which to teach C programming, a finding that is aligned with previous empirical studies concerning gamification on programming courses, carried out in academic contexts. Nonetheless, we are aware that further validation is also required to corroborate and strengthen the findings obtained and to investigate whether the kind of gamified elements (mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics) used have any influence on students' performance, among other issues that deserve further investigation and that are explained throughout this article.";"19466226";14;"USA";"Web of Science"

This study was an extension of our previous studies, which only considered the data from gamification systems, leaving several open questions about students' perspective. Two types of websites, Gamification (GM) and Non-gamification (NG) were used. While the GM website included game elements such as a Badge System, Score, Avatar, Leaderboard, Level, and Feedback (Notification), the NG website was a traditional website without game elements. In these websites, students conducted two main activities: creating their own questions (MCQs) and answering questions authored by classmates. Students were asked to complete the questionnaire regarding active learning, game elements, and motivation. Several statistical analyses were conducted to test four hypotheses, and results indicated support for all hypotheses. The results suggest that the application of gamification in engineering lab activities as a supporting tool has a positive effect on students' motivation, engagement, and learning outcome based on the consistency between students' performance in and subjective satisfaction with the gamification system. In addition, the results of frequency analysis indicate that 80% of students were motivated by Ranking and Score and 50% of students felt fun due to Badges, Feedback, and Avatar.

Collective intelligence could potentially decrease the error rates of nonexperts. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and impact of collective intelligence for the detection of skin cancer. Methods: We created a gamified study platform on a stack of established Web technologies and presented 4216 dermatoscopic images of the most common benign and malignant pigmented skin lesions to 1245 human raters with different levels of experience. Raters were recruited via scientific meetings, mailing lists, and social media posts. Education was self-declared, and domain-specific experience was tested by screening tests. In the target test, the readers had to assign 30 dermatoscopic images to 1 of the 7 disease categories. The readers could repeat the test with different lesions at their own discretion. Collective human intelligence was achieved by sampling answers from multiple readers. The disease category with most votes was regarded as the collective vote per image. Results: We collected 111,019 single ratings, with a mean of 25.2 (SD 18.5) ratings per image. As single raters, nonexperts achieved a lower mean accuracy (58.6%) than experts (68.4%; mean difference=-9.4%; 95% CI -10.74% to -8.1%; P<.001). Collectives of nonexperts achieved higher accuracies than single raters, and the improvement increased with the size of the collective. A collective of 4 nonexperts surpassed single nonexperts in accuracy by 6.3% (95% CI 6.1% to 6.6%; P<.001). The accuracy of a collective of 8 nonexperts was 9.7% higher (95% CI 9.5% to 10.29%; P<.001) than that of single nonexperts, an improvement similar to single experts (P=.73). The sensitivity for malignant images increased for nonexperts (66.3% to 77.6%) and experts (64.6% to 79.4%) for answers given faster than the intrarater mean. Conclusions: A high number of raters can be attracted by elements of gamification and Web-based marketing via mailing lists and social media. Nonexperts increase their accuracy to expert level when acting as a collective, and faster answers correspond to higher accuracy. This information could be useful in a teledermatology setting.";"14388871";1;"Canada";"Web of Science"

We describe here AntibioGame (R), a serious game for improving the training of medical students in antibiotic use in primary care. Objective: We aimed to design a serious game for antibiotics teaching and to evaluate its usability and playability by medical students. Methods: We used various gamification techniques (e.g. use of mascots, avatars, rewards, leader board) and cartoon graphics in the design of AntibioGame (R). This game implements clinical case templates built from a list of learning goals defined by a medical team through an analysis of clinical practice guidelines. The game was evaluated by asking medical students to rate their satisfaction and the usability and playability of the game on an electronic form and through group discussions. The electronic form was derived from the MEEGA + scale, a fivepoint Likert scale including 32 items for assessing both usability and playability. Results: AntibioGame (R) is a case-based game in which students play the role of a doctor meeting patients in consultation and helping other health professionals to solve their problems, as in real life. The scenarios are realistic and cover situations frequently encountered in primary care. The 57 medical students enrolled found the game attractive, usable, fun, and appropriate for learning. Game quality was considered good (score = 60 on the MEEGA + scale). All the students said they would recommend the game, 96 % liked it and 81 % would use it for revision. Conclusion: AntibioGame (R) is a promising tool for improving knowledge in antibiotic prescription that could easily be included in multifaceted programs for training medical students.";"13865056";3;"Ireland";"Web of Science"

Conventional teaching method focuses on lectures and solving race condition problem with counting semaphore in C programming language. Before applying conventional teaching method, we advocate the introduction of a social game scenario in teaching basic concepts of workers concurrently competing over a shared resource. We also introduce a simplified mutual exclusion assignment in which the implementation complexity is reduced by application of a specially designed graphical mechanism for mutual exclusion. Compared to a conventional method, the proposed experimental teaching method has a 15% higher success rate in solving race condition problem in C programming language.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of using game mechanics and a student-generated questions strategy to promote algorithmic thinking skills in an online puzzle-based game learning system. An online puzzle-based game learning system, TGTS (Turtle Graphics Tutorial System), was developed to help students learn algorithmic thinking skills by allowing them to solve puzzles. A quasi-experiment was conducted to examine the effectiveness of using game mechanics alone and using game mechanics plus a student generated questions strategy. Nine fourth-grade elementary classes (n = 242) were used to form three treatment groups, including one without game mechanics, one using game mechanics, and one using game mechanics plus a student-generated questions strategy. The results indicate that TGTS with game mechanics significantly enhanced algorithmic thinking skills and puzzle-solving performance. Furthermore, although TGTS with game mechanics plus the student-generated questions strategy is less effective than TGTS with only game mechanics in puzzle solving, it is in fact more effective in enhancing the algorithmic thinking skills. Additionally, this study demonstrated that TGTS with game mechanics plus the student-generated questions strategy can enhance students' engagement experiences and willingness to participate. This study can be a reference for designing learning activities and developing an online puzzle-based game learning system to promote students' learning of algorithmic thinking skills.";"03601315";19;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

The study findings suggested that the gamification approach only had positive effects on the students' number of comments and performance in online discussions who were more aware of the gamification approach. However, it appears that the gamification approach failed in promoting students' sense of community. Additionally, students' responses to the interviews and open-ended questions revealed similar results, although more students in the gamified group indicated that the online discussions forced them to think hard. The limited influence of the gamification approach in the current study may be attributed to several factors that related to the facilitation of the gamification approach, the types of badges, and technical issues.

This has been problematic in a number of ways and resulted in fragmented literature and inconsistent referencing patterns between different sub-disciplines and countries. This is mainly because no distinct single-disciplinary perspective has emerged because of: the cross-disciplinary nature of educational games, a reliance on single-disciplinary contexts for studies, changing terminologies in different contexts and the use of multi-methodological approaches. Distinct perspectives from education science, game science, neuroscience and information science have deepened our understanding of play and games.

Previous works deal with teaching about privacy using educational online content, and media literacy. However, these tools do not necessarily promote less risky behaviors, and do not allow the assessment of users' behavior after the learning period. Moreover, few research studies about the effects of social gamification have been performed for this population segment (i.e., teenagers). To address this problem in this article, we propose the use of gamification in an OSN called Pesedia to facilitate the teaching/learning process, and assess its effectiveness in promoting suitable privacy behaviors. We tested our proposal comparing teenagers' performance in two editions of a course about social networks, and privacy (with, and without gamification) for one month. We measured the impact of gamification in the participants' behaviors toward privacy concepts as a consequence of the privacy teaching/learning process, and the participants' engagement in the educational process. The results show that there are significant differences in participants' behavior regarding privacy, and engagement in the gamified social network. Moreover, there is also a significant difference in participants' engagement for the gamified male participants. The gamified social network proposed in this article may be relevant, and useful for educators who wish to develop, and enhance teenagers' privacy skills, or for a broader base of aspects related to the development of digital competences, and technology in education.";"19391382";0;"USA";"Web of Science"

E-learning exercises containing implemented adaptive elements were created in accordance with the Bloom's Taxonomy. Within the pilot study the authors detected high percentage success rate during e-learning exercise completion. This leads to formulation of the question Can any e-learning exercise of lower cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy be skipped without affecting the cognitive thinking for solution of the e-learning exercises on upper cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy? To answer the question, the algorithm of adaptive e-learning was defined and hypotheses were established. The research was carried out as pedagogical experiment comparing the results of both experimental and control groups of pupils. The research hypotheses were confirmed by statistical analysis of the research data. The results confirm that adaptive features of e-learning can be implemented in the primary education. The research results confirm the fact that educational objectives can be achieved with some pupils more effectively. Consequently, the implementation of adaptive elements into e-learning at the primary school supports an individual approach when completing e-learning exercises according to the principle of cognitive computing.";"07475632";20;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

Platforms such as Kahoot!, accompanied by the student's smartphone, allow the teacher to create a classroom response system (CRS) a fast and straightforward way. The present study, with a non-experimental design, is developed to assess the use of this tool in higher education, both in a face-to-face format and through a virtual learning environment. After applying an electronic questionnaire (20 items; alpha=.958) to a sample of 148 students (94 in the face-to-face mode and 54 in the virtual mode) whose teachers had used Kahoot! with the same methodological planning, a high degree of predisposition for their employment as future teaching professionals and positive perception of the resource is detected, especially when assessing their potential for self-assessment of the learning process and assimilation of the basic concepts of the subject. Likewise, after the Mann-Whitney U test, it was found that students in the virtual mode showed a higher score than those in the face-to-face mode. It concludes by stressing the importance of teachers using technological resources such as Kahoot to promote innovative methodologies for the benefit of quality higher education. Besides, as a consequence of the previous studies, it is considered that the discrepancies found are due to a more positive evaluation in the training modality where the use of this type of resources is more innovative.";"24448729";2;"Spain";"Web of Science"

We analyzed a total of 53 papers from 2010 to 2019 using qualitative analysis with complementary descriptive quantitative analysis. Our findings revealed three main AR learning activities: word spelling games, word knowledge activities, and location-based word activities. Our findings also uncovered five main design strategies: three-dimensional multimedia content, hands-on interaction with physical learning materials, gamification, spatial mappings, and location-based features. Several combinations of design and instructional strategies tended to be effective: Learning gains were enhanced by using three-dimensional multimedia with advanced organizers (presentation strategy) and/or using location-based content with learners' self-exploration (discovery strategy); and motivation was enhanced by using game mechanisms with discovery strategy. We suggest that future designers of AR early language applications should move beyond these basic approaches and consider how unique benefits of AR may be applied to support key activities in early language learning while also considering how to support sociotechnical factors such as collaboration between teachers and learners and different learning contexts. We conclude with a discussion of future directions for research in this emerging space.";"07356331";1;"USA";"Web of Science"

Research was conducted in two groups of 131 high school students in Poland. In each school, the research sample was divided into experimental and control groups. Each group was taught by the same teacher and participated in the same courses and tests before the game. Just after finishing the course on waves and vibrations (school 1) and optics (school 2), experimental groups took part in a group board game to assess their knowledge. One week after the game, the experimental and control groups (not involved in the game) took part in the post-tests. Students from the experimental groups performed better in the game than in the tests given before the game. As well their results in the post-tests were significantly higher statistically than students from the control groups. Simultaneously, student's opinions in the experimental groups about the board game as an assessment method were collected in an open-descriptive form and in a short questionnaire, and analyzed. Results showed that students experienced a positive attitude toward the assessment method, a reduction of test anxiety and an increase in their motivation for learning.";"0157244X";2;"Netherlands";"Web of Science"

We developed an online educational game designed to enhance core media and information literacy competencies and to help young adults become information literate citizens. We examined the game's effects on skepticism toward online information and information discernment skills, two of the most important MIL competencies. In an online experiment, a total of 210 participants between 20 and 29 years of age were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the game group that played the developed online game, the quiz group that completed a quiz with no game element, and the control group that did not receive any treatment. Before treatment, the participants' perceived levels of intellectual civic skills were measured with a pre-questionnaire. After treatment, skepticism toward online information and information discernment skills as learning outcomes were measured with survey items on skepticism toward online information and an information discernment skills test, respectively. The results showed that the game effectively enhanced the cognitive aspect of media and information literacy (information discernment skills), but not the attitudinal aspect (skepticism toward online information). In addition, the game was found to be effective regardless of the participant's perceived level of intellectual civic skills, while quiz with no game element was found to be effective only when the participant's perceived level of intellectual civic skills was high. These findings demonstrate the importance of digital game-based intervention as an educational resource. We extend our discussion to the advantages and limitations of games in fostering learners' abilities to evaluate online information.";"03601315";0;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

The moderating role of app expertise";570;"Bayuk, J; Altobello, SA";2019;"Article";"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING";"English";"Gamification; Intervention; Financial literacy; Financial well-being";"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore potential benefits of gamification (application of game-playing elements) for financial well-being and motivation to save. Design/methodology/approach - A preliminary survey of college students explored how gamification principles incorporated into money-savings/personal finance smartphone apps could improve financial well-being. The main study utilized Mechanical Turk participants, exposing them to financial game app descriptions that emphasized social features (e.g. leaderboards and ability to share achievements) or economic features (e.g. ability to earn real money or a higher interest rate). Objective and subjective financial measures including expertise with financial apps, perceived benefits of financial apps and behavioral intentions were examined. Findings - Financial worry, financial literacy, subjective knowledge and expertise with money-savings/financial applications predicted financial well-being. Additionally, consumers varied in their preferences for certain financial game app features based on past financial app experience. Those who already used a financial app tend to exhibit higher subjective (though not objective) knowledge, and want both social and economic features of financial applications, whereas those with no experience are more motivated by economic features. Practical implications - These results could be used to guide game designers regarding which features may be more attractive to consumers depending on their prior expertise with financial smartphone applications. Financial services marketing would benefit from further research into whether smartphone financial applications that emphasize social features have benefits for consumers' motivation and financial well-being. Originality/value - Examining college students about to enter the real world and the general population, this project contributes to research to improve understanding of financial well-being by examining how already having a financial gamification application impacts perceptions of knowledge and expertise, as well as intentions to save given a more socially focused vs economically focused savings app. Additional research needs to further explore gamification as an experimental intervention to ultimately improve both subjective financial well-being and objective financial behaviors, especially for consumers with lower expertise and high risk of financial vulnerability.";"02652323";8;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

However, becoming familiar with the facts behind the periodic table such as the element names and/or symbols, their metallic character, their electronegativity, and so on, may seem a tedious and boring task, depending on the approach the teacher uses. One way to stimulate students is through so-called gamification, in which learning occurs as an almost undetected consequence of playing a game. Of course, the game must be designed and prepared in such a way that the game and learning come together. In this work, we present Chemical Battleship, a chemical version of the classic board game Battleship, to learn the main topics contained in the periodic table and identify the common glassware of the lab. Additionally, using this game facilitates presenting the chemistry from a fun approach to certain educational levels. The periodic table itself is used to deploy the fleet, which is actually just labware. The shots must be fired by identifying the chemical element the player wants to fire at, and they must do so by using different properties of the element. Repeating this process, students get soon familiar with the periodic table and the information it contains, as well as with the lab glassware. Chemical Battleship was tested with elementary school students and third-year students in a Primary Education Teacher Degree program. Use of this game had a high acceptance from both groups, awakening students' interest and curiosity in the first group and improving knowledge in the latter group. Students enhanced not only their subjective perception of their knowledge but also what they really know about the periodic table, as reflected in the improvement of their marks.";"00219584";0;"USA";"Web of Science"

Design/methodology/approach - Dietrich et al. (2017) six-step framework was applied to a co-design project involving four groups of 14- to 16-year-old Australian high school students. Data collection included observations by three facilitators, written feedback from members of each group and video presentations of the generated ideas. The data analysis focused on investigating the applicability of the six-step framework to young consumers and evaluating the quality and practicality of the generated ideas. Findings - Sensitization is key to enabling young consumers to become equal participants during the co-design process. Sensitization allowed the participants to engage in the design task in a playful manner, which fostered active participation and creative insights during the co-design session. A team approach based on interactivity and group autonomy enabled adolescents to contribute insights into their specific needs and wants. This was complemented by a trusting environment and the presence of immediately available yet hands off facilitators. Research limitations/implications - The findings are limited to one specific sample and design task. Future research is required that investigates co-design with young consumers in different contexts.

Whether a cognitive style of education combined with learning modules can impact learning outcomes and satisfaction in millennial medical students is unknown. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of cognitive styles and learning modules using mobile e-learning on knowledge gain, competence gain, and satisfaction for emergent ORL-HNS disorders. Methods: This randomized controlled trial included 60 undergraduate medical students who were novices in ORL-HNS at an academic teaching hospital. The cognitive style of the participants was assessed using the group embedded figures test. The students were randomly assigned (1: 1) to a novel interactive multimedia (IM) group and conventional Microsoft PowerPoint show (PPS) group matched by age, sex, and cognitive style. The content for the gamified IM module was derived from and corresponded to the textbook-based learning material of the PPS module (video lectures). The participants were unblinded and used fully automated courseware containing the IM or PPS module on a 7-inch tablet for 100 min. Knowledge and competence were assessed using multiple-choice questions and multimedia situation tests, respectively. Each participant also rated their global satisfaction. Results: All of the participants (median age 23 years, range 22-26 years; 36 males and 24 females) received the intended intervention after randomization. Overall, the participants had significant gains in knowledge (median 50%, interquartile range [IQR]= 17%-80%, P<.001) and competence (median 13%, IQR=0%-33%, P=.006). There were no significant differences in knowledge gain (40%, IQR=13%-76% vs 60%, IQR=20%-100%, P=.42) and competence gain (0%, IQR=-21% to 38% vs 25%, IQR=0%-33%, P=.16) between the IM and PPS groups. However, the IM group had a higher satisfaction score (8, IQR=6-9 vs 6, IQR=4-7, P=.01) compared with the PPS group. Using Friedman's two-way nonparametric analysis of variance, cognitive styles (field-independent, field-intermediate, or field-dependent classification) and learning modules (IM or PPS) had significant effects on both knowledge gain (both adjusted P<.001) and satisfaction (both adjusted P<.001).

The impact and consequences of this innovative technology have not yet been satisfactory explored. This empirical study investigated the cognitive and social aspects of collaboration in a shared, immersive virtual reality. A unique application for implementing a collaborative immersive virtual environment (LIVE) was developed by our interdisciplinary team as a software solution for educational purposes, with two scenarios for learning about hypsography, i.e., explanations of contour line principles. Both scenarios allow switching between a usual 2D contour map and a 3D model of the corresponding terrain to increase the intelligibility and clarity of the educational content. Gamification principles were also applied to both scenarios to augment user engagement during the completion of tasks. A qualitative research approach was adopted to obtain a deep insight into the lived experience of users in a LIVE. It was thus possible to form a deep understanding of very new subject matter. Twelve pairs of participants were observed during their LIVE experience and then interviewed either in a semistructured interview or a focus group. Data from these three research techniques were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis, which is research method for studying individual experience. Four superordinate themes-with detailed descriptions of experiences shared by numerous participants-emerged as results from the analysis; we called these (1) Appreciation for having a collaborator, (2) The Surprising Fun with Maps, (3) Communication as a challenge, and (4) Cognition in two realities.

Self-Determination Theory suggests that people situationally appraise the functional significance or psychological meaning of a given stimulus, which can result in different motivational states, but there is little empirical work observing actual functionalisations of game design elements. We therefore conducted a qualitative in-the-wild diary and interview study with 81 university students who reported on their experiences with badges on two popular gamified online learning platforms, Khan Academy and Codecademy. Participants functionalised badges in nine distinct ways that only partially align with prior theory. Functionalisations shaped experience and motivation and prompted function-aligned behaviour. Badge design details fostered but did not determine different functionalisations, while no user or context characteristics were identified that reliably linked to particular functionalisations. We conclude that future research may need to conceptualise game design elements in a more differentiated way to capture what aspects support different motivational functions.";"10715819";4;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

An innovative burn prevention intervention was developed using these channels. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Cool Runnings, an app- based intervention to increase knowledge of childhood burn risk (specifically hot beverage scalds) and correct burn first aid among mothers of young children. Methods: This was a 2-group, parallel, single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants were women aged 18 years and above, living in Queensland, Australia, with at least 1 child aged 5-12 months at time of enrollment. The primary outcome measures were change in knowledge about risk of burns and correct burn first aid assessed via 2 methods: (1) overall score and (2) categorized as adequate (score=4) versus inadequate (score<4). Efficacy of gamification techniques was also assessed. Results: In total, 498 participants were recruited via social media and enrolled. At the 6-month follow-up, 244 participants completed the posttest questionnaire. Attrition rates in both groups were similar. Participants who remained in the study did not differ from those lost to follow-up on any characteristics except education level. Although similar at baseline, intervention group participants achieved significantly greater improvement in overall knowledge posttest than control group participants on both primary outcome measures (overall knowledge intervention: mean [SD] of overall knowledge 2.68 [SD 1.00] for intervention vs 2.13 [SD 1.03] for control; 20.7% [25/121] adequate in intervention vs 7.3% [2/123] in control). Consequently, the number needed to treat was 7.46. Logistic regression showed participants exposed to the highest level of disadvantage had 7.3 times higher odds of improved overall knowledge scores than participants in other levels of disadvantage. There were also significant correlations between gamification techniques and knowledge change (P<.001). In addition, odds of knowledge improvement between baseline and 6-month follow-up was higher in participants with low-moderate app activity compared with no app activity (odds ratio [OR] 8.59, 95% CI 2.9-25.02) and much higher in participants with high app activity (OR 18.26, 95% CI 7.1-46.8). Conclusions: Despite substantial loss to follow-up, this RCT demonstrates the Cool Runnings app was an effective intervention for improving knowledge about risks of hot beverage scalds and burn first aid in mothers of young children. The benefits of combining gamification elements in the intervention were also highlighted. Given the low cost and large reach of smartphone apps to deliver content to and engage with targeted populations, the results from this RCT provide important information on how smartphone apps can be used for widespread injury prevention campaigns and public health campaigns generally.";"14388871";5;"Canada";"Web of Science"

This also allows an effective transfer for scientific work, providing visibility to Research and Development. In this context, the main aim of the article is to describe the process to get an agreement between Babyradio (a children's entertainment company: https://babyradio.es/) and our research team, starting a collaborative work between two groups of people (Babyradio's technical designer and Psychologist-Engineers software designer), in order to create several educative applications (APPs) in the field of early mathematics cognition. The institutional framework of the relationship of the R&D project and a children's entertainment company is described. The article also focuses on experience in Psychology, Technological Innovation, and Entrepreneurship. In considering the efficiency of the agreement, we present different APPs designed for tablets and smartphone devices, adapted to the different operating systems (IOS, Android, Windows). APPs are designed to instill the cognitive fundamentals associated with early math learning for students aged 4 to 7 years. The study developed after this babyradio-university enterprise agreement contributes to the development of mathematics skills in children, aged 4-7 years, so that they can successfully meet the mathematics school requirements; it also contributes to encouraging a more positive attitude toward mathematics. This study also suggests how the education system and software and educational content developers' companies would manage verified instructional APPs, with a more realistic commercial perspective.";"16641078";3;"USA";"Web of Science"

Digital badges (hereafter badges) provide two potential supports for learning: (1) badges provide support for motivation by rewarding achievement and (2) badges provide implicit learning goals. The present paper describes two experiments in which we investigated whether badges can support self-regulated learning by comparing their impact on learning with students given explicit goals for student learning, a key factor in self-regulated learning. Specifically, we compared the effects of badges and goal setting in a low-stakes learning context (Experiment 1; online extra credit unit) and a high-stakes learning context (Experiment 2; introductory Educational Psychology courses). In these two quasi-experiments, participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: badge only, goal only, badge + goal, or control (i.e., no badge, no goal). Learning was measured by comparing performance on topics related to Turkish Culture (Experiment 1) or Educational Psychology (Experiment 2) at pre-test and post-test. Somewhat surprisingly, the results from both studies demonstrated no significant improvement in learning between groups. The discussion suggests that caution should be taken when incorporating badges in learning contexts and provides guidance on the conditions under which badges may be most effective for supporting learning.";"10421726";2;"USA";"Web of Science"

It was also aimed to investigate whether the utilization of the gamification tool led to a difference in academic achievement and student engagement. Three research groups were determined; two experimental groups where 7E instructional model gamified with Kahoot and Quizizz was implemented and a control group where conventional 7E instruction method was implemented. The groups were determined by random assignment of 97 pre-service teachers who took scientific research methods course in the 2017-2018 academic year spring semester. However, since only 71 of the assigned pre-service teachers voluntarily participated in the study, the study data included 71 pre-service teachers. At the beginning and the end of the six-week-long instruction activities, the academic achievement test and student engagement scale on the content instructed in the six-week-long scientific research methods course were applied. Furthermore, in-depth views of pre-service teachers were obtained with focus group interviews. Therefore, the study was conducted with mixed design principles. The study findings demonstrated that the scientific research methods academic achievement x student engagement x group interaction model (Wilks's lambda =.819, F-[2,F- 66] = 7.301, p < 0.05) was significant. The activities gamified with Kahoot application, albeit statistically insignificant, had a more positive impact on academic achievement and student engagement when compared to the other groups. On the other hand, it was observed that the positive impact of the activities gamified with Quizizz application was lower than that of the instruction method utilized in the control group both based on academic achievement (Delta<(X)over bar>(pretest-post-testquitizz) = 38.116, Delta(X) over bar (pretest-post-testcontrol) = 38.776) and student engagement (Delta(X) over bar (pretest-posttestqutzit). = 12.176, ARpretest-postm5 o,01 = 14.218).

Usually, these online courses offer universal access to learning, generating new challenges regarding the form they are taught and the pedagogical approaches used. In fact, despite the benefits of MOOCs in Higher Education (e.g. ubiquitous and free access to learning), these courses are frequently critized due to their content-based teaching models. Therefore, the application of strategies promoting active learning is presented as a potential technique to change these models and to improve the student participation and dropout rates. This paper reflects on the potential benefits of gamification and collaboration to enhance and motivate student involvement in MOOCs. To this end, a Design-Based Research (DBR) methodology has been applied aiming to show evidence of these pedagogical innovations in three MOOCs carried out by the University of Valladolid (Spain).

Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional, cross-country survey study (n=319) was conducted recruiting participants from one North American and two British universities. The survey data and the conceptual model have been analysed and tested using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings Participants displayed positive attitudes towards the 3D game and responded positively to theory presented as real-life scenarios; gamification techniques such as interactions and dialogue, and rewards and progression levels, which are part of the game, albeit the participants' adoption was driven more by extrinsic motivations (rewards) than intrinsic ones (ease of use and entertainment). In addition, the empirical results suggest that when gender is taken into account, the perceptions and needs of cross-cultural learners in serious gaming environments vary and display characteristics that are similar to Rogers' five adopter categories; thus, culture could significantly shape learners' decisions to adopt a serious game as a managerial learning tool. Research limitations/implications For future researchers, this paper highlights various levels of training, support and promotional awareness that need to be considered to facilitate the adoption of serious games for managerial learning. Practical implications For academics and practitioners in work-based learning and managerial training environments, this paper highlights the salient factors that need to be inherent in a serious 3D game, and best practices for scaffolding existing instructional approaches or training interventions.

With the advent of smart manufacturing technologies-better production equipment, sensing technologies, computational methods, and data analytics applied from the process to enterprise levels-the potential for sustainability performance improvement is tremendous. Sustainable manufacturing seeks the best balance of a variety of performance measures to satisfy and optimize the goals of all stakeholders. Accurate measures of performance are the foundation on which sustainability objectives can be pursued. Historically, operational and information technologies have undergone disparate development, with little convergence across the domains. To focus future research efforts in advanced manufacturing, the authors organized a one-day workshop, sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation, at the joint manufacturing research conferences of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Research needs were identified to help harmonize disparate manufacturing metrics, models, and methods from across conventional manufacturing, nanomanufacturing, and additive/hybrid manufacturing processes and systems. Experts from academia and government labs presented invited lightning talks to discuss their perspectives on current advanced manufacturing research challenges. Workshop participants also provided their perspectives in facilitated brainstorming breakouts and a reflection activity. The aim was to define advanced manufacturing research and educational needs for improving manufacturing process performance through improved sustainability metrics, modeling approaches, and decision support methods. In addition to these workshop outcomes, a review of the recent literature is presented, which identifies research opportunities across several advanced manufacturing domains. Recommendations for future research describe the short-, mid-, and long-term needs of the advanced manufacturing community for enabling smart and sustainable manufacturing.";"25206478";3;"USA";"Web of Science"

However, problems exist in current learning recommender systems available to students in that they are often general learning content and unable to offer personalized service. To overcome this, in the context of a learning style based on an Interpretive Structural Model (ISM), an adaptive learning path recommendation system is proposed comprising: (a) Fuzzy Delphi Method, (b) Fuzzy ISM and (c) Kelly Repertory Grid Technology. The results show that the learning outcome with ALPRS is better than those from general learning course guided recommendation mechanisms, and the scores of system satisfaction with ALPRS and personal service are higher than 90%. Results of recall (95%), precision (68%), F1 index (45%) and MAE (8%) prove that ALPRS outperforms other approaches. Finally, three contributions are offered in this study:(1) a novel hybrid ALPRS is proposed and its practicability is tested; (2) a prototype gamification geometry-teaching material module is developed for the promotion in MSTE (Mathematics, Science and Technology Education) areas; (3) the adaptive geometry-learning path diagram generated with ISM based on learning styles could offer a basis for further studies.";"13058215";10;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

Visualization literacy skills are vital in understanding the world around us and constructing meaningful visualizations, yet, how to better develop these skills at an early age remains largely overlooked and understudied. Only recently has the visualization community started to fill this gap, resulting in preliminary studies and development of educational tools for use in early education. We add to these efforts through the exploration of gamification to support learning, and identify an opportunity to apply role-playing game-based designs by leveraging the presence of narratives in data-related problems involving visualizations. We study the effects of including narrative elements on learning through a technology probe, grounded in a set of design considerations stemming from visualization, game design and education science. We create two versions of a game - one with narrative elements and one without - and evaluate our instances on 33 child participants between 11- to 13-years old using a between-subjects study design. Despite participants requiring double the amount of time to complete their game due to additional narrative elements, the inclusion of such elements were found to improve engagement without sacrificing learning; our results indicate no significant differences in development of graph-reading skills, but significant differences in engagement and overall enjoyment of the game. We report observations and qualitative feedback collected, and note areas for improvement and room for future work.";"10772626";0;"USA";"Web of Science"

Gamification is starting to play an important role in education with the objective of providing engagement and improving the motivation of students. One specific example is the use of badges. The analysis of users' interactions and behaviors with the badge system can be used to improve the learning process, e.g., by adapting the learning materials and giving game-based activities to students depending on their interest toward badges. In this work, we propose some metrics that provide information regarding the behavior of students with badges, including if they are intentionally earning them, the concentration for achieving them and their time efficiency. We validate these metrics by providing an extensive analysis of 291 different students interacting with a local instance of Khan Academy within our courses for freshmen at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. This analysis includes relationship mining between badge indicators and others related to the learning process, the analysis of specific archetypal profiles of students that represent a broader population and also by clustering students by their badge indicators with the objective of customizing learning experiences. We finalize by discussing the implications of the results for engineering education, providing guidelines into how instructors can take advantage of the findings of the research and how researchers can replicate experiments similar to this one in other general contexts.";"0949149X";16;"Ireland";"Web of Science"

The way in which preservice science teachers prepare to practice one's profession, approach to some concepts, events or phenomena can be determined effectively through metaphors. This research's aim is to determine the approaches of preservice science teachers about physics that they have difficulty in understanding and physics problem solving that they have difficulty in solving through metaphors. The participants of the research are comprised of 139 students who are studying in different classes in the science teacher education program at the Faculty of Education at a university in the Eastern Black Sea Region. In the pattern of phenomenology, the data were collected through a questionnaire and have been subjected to content analysis by NVivo 11 program. Generated metaphors are generally grouped under the headings nature, benefits and needs. It has been found that the codes often emphasize the link between physics and daily life, difficulty, combining different kinds of knowledge and skills, and relation with logic. Some of the results reached are those: Even though preservice teachers associate physics and physics problems with life, they remember the solution process of routine physics problems when they face with a physics problem. They have difficulties in understanding physics and solving physics problems, and think that solving physics problems probably depends on combining information in a related way. Related to these results, suggestions such as giving different types of problems in physics lessons, gamification the physics teaching, adding a lesson about physics problem solving strategies have been offered.";"25364758";0;"Turkey";"Web of Science"

This has posed several challenges in terms of skilled and prepared professionals that have always to be up to date in an industry that is constantly changing. Thus, teaching tools have gained an increasing interest. The present research reviewed the state of the art in terms of digital interactive training tools pinpointing that the existing options do not feature the user involvement in the development of the training material. Hence, the main aim of this paper is to develop and test an innovative method based on gamification to increase wind energy sector industrial skills, providing a digital interactive environment in the form of a new user-friendly software that can allow its users to train and contribute to the teaching and learning contents. The first methodological step deals with the associated background studies that were required at strategy implementation and development stages, including market analysis and technology trade-offs, as well as the general structure and the implementation steps of the software design. Obtained results pinpointed that with minimal use of web-based database and network connectivity, a mobile phone application could work in the form of a time-scored quiz application that remotely located staff at wind energy farms could benefit from. The technological innovation brought by this research will substantially improve the service of training, allowing a more dynamic formative management contributing to an improvement in the competitiveness and a step towards excellence for the whole sector.

Past research demonstrates that serious games are prime candidates to utilise these principles, however the potential benefits of this approach for delivering drug education are yet to be examined in Australia, a country where drug education in schools is mandatory. Design and MethodsThe serious game Pure Rush' was developed across three stages. First, formative consultation was conducted with 115 students (67% male, aged 15-17 years), followed by feasibility and acceptability testing of a prototype of the game (n = 25, 68% male). In the final stage, 281 students (62% female, aged 13-16 years) were randomly allocated to receive a lesson involving Pure Rush or an active control lesson. The lessons were compared in terms of learning outcomes, lesson engagement and future intentions to use illicit drugs. ResultsStudents enjoyed playing Pure Rush, found the game age-appropriate and the information useful to them. Both the Pure Rush and the active control were associated with significant knowledge increase from pre to post-test. Among females, multi-level mixed-effects regression showed knowledge gain was greater in the Pure Rush condition compared to control ( = 2.36, 95% confidence interval 0.36-4.38). There was no evidence of between condition differences in lesson engagement or future intentions to use illicit drugs. Discussion and ConclusionsPure Rush is an innovative online drug education game that is well received by students and feasible to implement in schools.

Existing literature describes progressive developments and assessments of IPE in colleges of pharmacy and medicine; however, there are fewer reports describing processes or projects that foster physician-pharmacist IPR in clinical practices without established interprofessional collaborations. Objectives: The primary objective was to establish IPR between pharmacists and osteopathic residents in a community teaching hospital. The secondary objective was to innovate the delivery of pharmacotherapeutic content delivered to the residents during their didactic lecture series by providing active learning strategies. Methods: This report describes a project wherein college of pharmacy faculty developed IPR with osteopathic residents in a community teaching hospital that previously did not have any established physician-pharmacist IPR. Osteopathic medical residents completed a post-implementation survey after they attended a 12-month series of didactic lectures that incorporated active learning delivered by pharmacist faculty. Results: Sixty-six residents were eligible to complete the survey; 20 residents completed the survey. Eighteen residents believed that both physicians and pharmacists should be educated to establish IPR and that it should be included in professional, graduate, and continuing education settings for both professions. Sixteen residents believed that the active learning techniques employed by college of pharmacy faculty were useful for IPR. Conclusions: Physician-pharmacist IPR may be achievable in settings where IPR was previously sparse. Shared interests, adherence, and innovations in IPR frameworks are essential for developing physician-pharmacist IPR.";"87551225";1;"USA";"Web of Science"

The University, as a Communicator, an intermediary between the student and the information provided to it, is forced to change the centuries-old traditions in order to stay on the market, in the face of fierce competition of the appeared open distance courses. The purpose of the research is to analyze the role of digital communication in the educational request of students. Research methods: As research methods, the following one was used: online questionnaire survey that allows you to analyze the prerequisites for the development of digital communication in the educational process and identify new opportunities in education through the personal account of the student. Research results: the article examines the reasons for using the personal account and determines the prospects for its further development in the University environment. The satisfaction of using a personal account from mobile devices among active users-students was studied. The existing problems are identified and the reasons for the rare use of the personal account are identified, strategies for attracting students' attention to the personal account are formulated. The novelty and originality of the research lies in the fact that the concept of digital communication is considered in the context of education and its functions are highlighted. The main features of digital communication are presented. The level of approval of existing and potential innovations by active student users (chat for communication, modified portfolio, task scheduler and Bulletin Board from the Institute) is determined. The opinion of students regarding the content of the main page of the personal account is revealed. The preconditions for the development of digital communication in the educational process are investigated: the emergence of digital natives' generation; the resulting request to continuing education; growing importance of self-education; formation of the concept of anticipatory learning; rapid development of open education; a trend to introduce elements of gamification into educational process; the universal gadgetization. The essence of the information and educational environment of the University and the opportunities it provides are studied. The possibilities of the student personal account as a single information space are considered. Recommendations for the modernization of the personal account are given: to rename the group of incomprehensible and non-visited subsections by students; to change the content of the main page by moving the schedule and the number of the school week on it. The research identifies problems with color (the ideal option that would solve a large number of problems, according to students, is the ability to independently design the color scheme or a choice of several options) and the design of the personal account (the main emphasis in the development of the personal account is most effective to make the development of a convenient and visual system of informing students; self-filling the main menu of the personal account, students themselves formulate the need for personalization of the personal account).";"19863497";0;"Turkey";"Web of Science"

This study used in-depth interviews with key developmental stakeholders for two civic-focused games, Haki2 in Kenya and Your Excellency in Nigeria, to further our understanding in two important but understudied areas: the potential for games to facilitate civic learning and engagement outcomes in developing democratic contexts; and the role of game production and dissemination processes in this potential. I argue that these processes provide opportunities for direct civic engagement, participatory learning, and group mobilization relevant to facilitating civic behavior in developing democratic contexts. While this research identifies critical limitations for games used as stand-alone tools to achieve civic learning and engagement outcomes, it also identifies the potential for game production and dissemination to engage communities in democratic deliberation, in identifying relevant civic-issues and solutions, to facilitate community discussion, and to mobilize players around relevant issues.";"01634437";0;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

Mediating Role of Engagement";229;"Acharya, A; Gupta, M";2020;"Article";"JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IN ORGANIZATIONS";"English";"Challenge; Engagement; Gamification; Learning; Skill; Video Game";"Gamification, the usage of elements relating to game design to non-game activities, has gained considerable attention from academia and industry. It is uncertain as to whether students require skills and challenges to engage them in the game for enhancing their learning. Thus, the objective of this article is to examine the mediating role of engagement in the relationship between skill and perceived learning as well as between challenge and perceived learning in game-based learning environments. Data was gathered using a survey of Player Unknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) players. A total of 233 young Indian players participated in the study. The results showed that engagement fully mediates the relationship between skill and perceived learning as well as between challenge and perceived learning. This study contributes to the literature on game-based learning by providing evidence for the educational video games to be one of the effective means of learning. Results of the present study imply that the educational game designers can design challenging games to engage the students.";"15392937";1;"USA";"Web of Science"

Despite increasing academic research exploring the use of gamification in education little is known about teachers' main drivers and barriers to using gamification in their courses. Using a phenomenology approach, 16 online structured interviews were conducted in order to explore the main drivers that encourage teachers serving in Higher Education institutions to using gamification in their courses. The main barriers that prevent teachers from using gamification were also analysed. Four main drivers (attention-motivation, entertainment, interactivity, and easiness to learn) and four main barriers (lack of resources, students' apathy, subject fit, and classroom dynamics) were identified. Results suggest that teachers perceive the use of gamification both as beneficial but also as a potential risk for classroom atmosphere.

Moreover, schools are valuable fields for teaching the principles of these concepts especially through novel methods such as gamification. Earthquake in the city was implemented in a school in Tehran, Iran, and its effectiveness on learning the concepts of professional commitment was evaluated. Earthquake in the city was built based upon a fantasy scenario occurring in an imaginary city. Each student took on a role in the city (citizen or healthcare provider). After finishing the game, participants were asked about the concept of professional commitment. Their definition was scored by a group of medical ethics experts separately in terms of compliance with the actual definitions and compared with their peers in the control group who did not participate in the game. A group of 16-year-old teenagers studying in the 11th grade participated in this intervention. The average score of conformity with the actual concept of professional commitment among the case group participants was significantly higher than the average value for the control group (P < 0.05). The results of this study could provide insights to planners and educators engaged in the education system so that gamification can be incorporated as an influential tool to teach the concepts of professional commitment. This experience can also be generalized to other concepts, but designing the appropriate scenario will be the most important component of the intervention in these cases.";"20080387";1;"Iran";"Web of Science"

Design Systematic review with meta-synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data. Methods Comprehensive search of multiple databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, SCOPUS and Cochrane CENTRAL) and grey literature. Studies were included if the intervention was primarily an app aimed at improving at least two lifestyle behaviours in adults with cardiovascular disease. Meta-synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data was performed to review and evaluate findings. Results Ten studies of varying designs including 607 patients from five countries were included. Interventions targeted hypertension, heart failure, stroke and cardiac rehabilitation populations. Factors that improved among app users were rehospitalisation rates, disease-specific knowledge, quality of life, psychosocial well-being, blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, cholesterol and exercise capacity. Improved physical activity, medication adherence and smoking cessation were also characteristic of app users. Appealing app features included tracking healthy behaviours, self-monitoring, disease education and personalised, customisable content. Small samples, short duration and selection bias were noted limitations across some studies, as was the relatively low overall scientific quality of evidence. Conclusions Multiple behaviours and cardiovascular disease risk factors appear modifiable in the shorter term with use of mobile apps.

Objective: The aim of this study was to conceptualize a theory-based and evidence-based mHealth intervention called SMARTFAMILY (SF) that targets physical activity and healthy eating in a collective family-based setting. Subsequently, the app will be refined and re-evaluated to analyze additional effects of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) and gamification features. Methods: A smartphone app based on behavior change theories and behavior change techniques was developed and implemented and will be evaluated with family members individually and cooperatively (SF trial). Existing evidence and gained results were used to refine and will be used to re-evaluate the app (SF2.0 trial). Both trials are cluster randomized controlled trials with 3 measurement occasions. The intervention group uses the app for 3 consecutive weeks, whereas the control group receives no treatment. Baseline measurements (T-0) and postintervention measurements (T-1) include physical activity (ie, self-reported and accelerometly) and healthy eating measurements (ie, self-reported fruit and vegetable intake) as the primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes (ie, self-reported) are intrinsic motivation, behavior-specific self-efficacy, and the family health climate, complemented by an intentional measure in SF2.0. Four weeks following T-1, a follow-up assessment (T-2) is completed by the participants, consisting of all questionnaire items to assess the stability of the intervention effects. Mixed-method analysis of covariance will be used to calculate the primary intervention effects (ie, physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake) while controlling for covariates, including family health climate, behavior-specific self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation. Results: This study is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and ethically approved by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. For both trials, it is hypothesized that the apps will positively influence physical activity and healthy eating in the whole family. Furthermore, SF2.0 is expected to produce stronger effects (ie, higher effect sizes) compared to SF. SF app development and piloting are completed. Data acquisition for the SF trial is terminated and discontinued due to the COVID-19 pandemic. SF2.0 app development and piloting are completed, while data acquisition is ongoing. Participant recruitment for the SF 2.0 trial started in February 2020. The results for SF are expected to be published in mid-2021, and the results of SF2.0 are expected to be published in mid-2022. Conclusions: In this study, it is hypothesized that targeting the whole family will facilitate behavior change at the individual level and the family level, as the implemented strategies address changes in daily family life. Furthermore, subsequent app development (SF2.0) with supplementary addition of motivation-enhancing features and a JITAI approach is expected to enhance positive intervention effects.";"19290748";0;"Canada";"Web of Science"

DESIGN: Retrospective, cohort study. Level III evidence. Surgical interventions included long cephalomedullary nailing with gamification techniques compared to long cephalomedullary nailing alone. Main outcome measurements were total fluoroscopy time, operative time, hospital length of stay, discharge status, and complications. SETTING: Urban Level 1 Trauma Center. PARTICIPANTS: One fourty-eight adult patients with operative intertrochanteric femur fractures from January 2010 to January 2019. RESULTS: There were lower total operative times (45.6 vs. 57.1 minutes, p =< 0.01) and fluoroscopy times (1.6 vs. 2.1 minutes, p = 0.01) in the gamification group. There were no significant differences between groups in patient demographics, fracture pattern, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, total follow-up, total ICU stay time, or discharge to extended care facility versus home. CONCLUSIONS: Gamification techniques with use of long cephalomedullary nails are a valid approach to the treatment of intertrochanteric femur fractures. This approach demonstrates equivalent outcomes postoperatively to nongamification treatment of intertrochanteric femur fractures, with the potential advantage of decreased operative and fluoroscopic times.

Nowhere else is this more important than in education. Considering the careful build-up and implementation of game-elements could improve academic performance outcome and student motivation. However, Gamification could require much more time to be designed and applied to education related activities and it also comes with significant operating and design cost to provide highly engaging activities for students. One of the main problems in designing Gamification is the question: which game elements should be applied to student activities?. Moreover one must make sure that it has great impact on students' performance in terms of their education related performance. Hence, in this research, we focused on studying the impact of each element in order to investigate the behavioral outcome of game elements in educational environments through the concept of knowledge and game-based learning from the Gamification concept. In our experiment, we examined the impact of each game element on senior high school students based on the basic elements of Gamification such as Leaderboard, Cooperative and Awarding badges. In addition, we studied the effect of the game-based learning application called Aqua Republica from UNEP and DHI centers with partner of Thailand. The experiment design compared two groups: the Non-Gamified and the Gamified groups participating in the game-based learning activity Aqua Republica. Academic indicators and numerical indicators were used to directly measure the effect and behavioral outcome of the use of game elements.

Yet, there is a consensus that CS has serious conundrums particularly in attracting students, low motivation for learning computer programming and developing computational thinking (CT) skills. New motivational methods are needed to take the attention of students and adapt to their learning patterns as how people learn have changed drastically over the last two decades. To address these issues, video games and video game-based tools are proposed as a primary approach for motivating and supporting students in developing their skills in CT and support their learning of introductory programming. This research is concerned with the capture of statistical evidence on the educational effectiveness of playing a serious game specifically designed to enhance the development of CT skills to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. A total of 190 students were invited to participate in a quasi-experimental pre-post study for the purpose of analyzing the impact of an adhoc game on students' confidence in learning programming constructs and using their skills in CT. All students were studying a CS degree at the time and they were all registered to a first-year computer programming course. 151 out of 190 students successfully completed the study and the findings suggest that a) the intrinsic motivation to learn programming; b) students' perception of their knowledge and their tangible knowledge in key programming constructs (i.e. programming sequence, methods, decision making and loops); and c) students' confidence in using their CT skills were all statistically and significantly improved after playing the game. Additionally, students perceived computer programming significantly less difficult in their post study responses when compared to their pre study responses.";"21693536";0;"USA";"Web of Science"

This means that this knowledge has been acquired fast and superficially. Thus, discernment turns into something ephemeral, because there is not a profound examination of the aspects dealt with. This is caused by the enormous quantity of information found that, in many cases, does not reflect reality. In this sense, teachers can find multitasking students that can perform many activities but without reflexively undertaking them. Education tries to solve these type of problems so the learning-teaching process is as significant as possible. Therefore, future teachers should always have tools for keeping students' attention, as well as to raise interest in the studied subjects. Within these new tools, escape rooms are, because they not only increase students' motivation but also encourage teamwork and reflexive learning, as the tasks to be solved are complex. However, as male and female present different perspectives towards gamification, in this work, escape rooms have been studied applying a gender perspective. In the University of Seville, Spain, a descriptive-interpretative exploratory study took place intending to analyse future female teachers' conceptions about escape rooms. A 17-item questionnaire was applied to 99 female students of the Degree in Primary Education. Results show that subjects highly valued the ludic part of the escape rooms as a didactic activity, which fosters significant learning. Students also appreciated that the activity was close to their reality and that it was integrating students' interests in the Primary Education classroom. The main conclusion of the study is that, even if there is room for improvement and there is a need to make them more appealing to female students, escape rooms are considered an excellent educative resource as well as an adequate alternative teaching methodology.";"14499789";0;"Australia";"Web of Science"

This article presents Escapp, a web platform that allows teachers to conduct effective and highly engaging educational escape rooms. The platform has been used for conducting three different educational escape rooms (one face-to-face and two remotely) in three higher education settings. Three case studies were conducted to empirically evaluate the usefulness of Escapp for conducting these activities, which involved more than 400 students. On the one hand, a questionnaire was administered to students to gather their opinions on the Escapp platform, obtaining very positive results in terms of overall usefulness, usability and engagement. On the other hand, data automatically recorded by Escapp during the three educational escape rooms are presented as evidence of the high number of student interactions that take place during activities of this kind and the need of using a software system for conducting them in an effective way. The results of this article show that Escapp is a well-suited solution for conducting effective face-to-face and remote educational escape rooms.";"21693536";1;"USA";"Web of Science"

As a result, nursing students' performance in administering medication facilitated by technology is often poor. Serious gaming has been recommended as a possible intervention to improve nursing students' performance with electronic medication administration in nursing education. Objective: The objectives of this study are to examine whether the use of a gamified electronic medication administration simulator (1) improves nursing students' attention to medication administration safety within simulated practice, (2) increases student self-efficacy and knowledge of the medication administration process, and (3) improves motivational and cognitive processing attributes related to student learning in a technology-enabled environment. Methods: This study comprised the development of a gamified electronic medication administration record simulator and its evaluation in 2 phases. Phase 1 consists of a prospective, pragmatic randomized controlled trial with second-year baccalaureate nursing students at a Canadian university. Phase 2 consists of qualitative focus group interviews with a cross-section of nursing student participants. Results: The gamified medication administration simulator has been developed, and data collection is currently under way. Conclusions: If the gamified electronic medication administration simulator is found to be effective, it could be used to support other health professional simulated education and scaled more widely in nursing education programs.";"19290748";1;"Canada";"Web of Science"

To this end, an intervention is proposed in the subject of Computer Architecture based on two components covering theoretical and practical sessions. In the theoretical sessions, a serious game experience using Kahoot has been introduced, complementing the master classes and class exercises. For the practical sessions, the development of projects with groups of students has been proposed, whose results in terms of computer performance can be compared through a competition (hackathon). Evaluation of the serious game-based intervention has been approached in terms of student satisfaction and motivation, as well as improved academic performance.

Gamification is a technique that has been shown to improve engagement, transferring the positive effects of videogames. However, the mobile games industry has identified that player retention decreases quickly over time, but it is unclear if this decreasing retention pattern transfers to gamification activities. To check if the behavioral engagement was stable over a 14-week engineering course, we gamified an existing virtual learning environment (VLE), conducting an observational study for two semesters. Actions performed by students within the VLE were used to measure behavioral engagement, which allows us to track student behavior weekly. To analyze the gamification effect, we divided user actions into two groups: academic and gamified. The results showed that the gamified actions performed by students in the VLE decreased every week, which was significantly higher than the decrease in academic actions. This shows that the decreasing retention pattern seen in mobile games was also present in this study. These results suggest that, just like in mobile games, to sustain the behavioral engagement over a long period of time in a gamified class, additional modern game-design techniques should be considered.";"10613773";0;"USA";"Web of Science"

Games have become more pervasive: they have been adopted for use in many industries and sectors such as defense, medicine, architecture, education, and city planning and government as tools for workers development. In Malaysia, it has been reported that t he construction industry holds the third highest record of occurrences of accidents at work. Therefore, safety training is inevitable to reduce the alarming rate of accidents on construction sites. However, currently, available safety training approaches are still lacking in terms of delivering hands-on training and are more theoretical-instead of being more practical-based. This is due to the nature of the construction environment itself in which safety training involving certain hazards that cannot be implemented hands-on as it may bring harm to trainers, trainees and the environment. Gaming is an approach that applies technology to provide an almost real experience with interactive field training, and also supporting the theory of learning by doing with real case scenario.

Despite its potential and the increasing number of gamified systems their success is still limited due to the fact that gamifying learning is a challenging process. Part of the challenge stems from an insufficient understanding of the motivational mechanisms of gamification on learners' experience and from the insufficient attention to factors contributing to gameful experiences and promoting sustainable engagement. In addition, there is limited empirical evidence on motivational influences driving students to participate in gamified learning activities. Another factor slowing down the progress of successfully gamified applications is the scarcity of tools that would enable instructors to design and implement gamified activities as part of their instructional strategy. In an attempt to address these challenges, the present paper examines the difficulties inherent in the gamification of educational activities and how the OneUp gamification platform can support instructors in overcoming them with the mechanisms it provides for affording gameful experiences and sustainable engagement. To add to the understanding of the motivational influences towards gamified learning activities, the paper presents a preliminary study of student motivation to use One Up for out-of-class practicing in a gamified Data Structures course.

The sustainability of the effects of gamification pedagogy is also in doubt as some scholars think that such effects are short-term and not sustainable. This paper presents the results of three sub-studies of examining the effects of an online gamified reading platform and the sustainability of these effects. Study 1 examined the change in students' academic performance between two groups divided based on their different participation levels. Study 2 addressed the question of how students/parents/teachers perceive students' motivation and gaining in the use of the gamified platform. Study 3 explored the sustainability of the effects of the gamified platform from a longitudinal perspective. Findings suggest that students' deep engagement in the gamified e-learning platform can help increase their reading motivation and improve their reading abilities. Such effects can be sustained for several semesters. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Reading is very important for children's development. However, the ubiquity of digital entertainment (eg, digital games & online videos) occupies children's attention and energy, resulting in a decline in children's reading motivation. At present, gamification has been widely used in e-learning to increase learners' learning motivation and engagement. Few studies have focused on children's gamified reading supported by sufficient empirical evidence. What this paper adds This study proposes a gamification pedagogy with a gamified reading platform to facilitate primary students' reading motivation and competence. This study uses a mixed-method approach to examine the effects of the proposed gamification pedagogy on students' reading interest, motivation, habits and abilities. This study explores the sustainability of the gamified platform effects and fills the research gap regarding the sustainability of gamification pedagogy. Implications for practice and/or policy Active users of the gamified reading platform benefit from it in reading interest, motivation, habits, and abilities. The effects of gamification pedagogy can be sustainable when users' intrinsic learning motivation is aroused.";"00071013";2;"USA";"Web of Science"

Thus, the overriding purpose of the study was to provide a diagnostic insight into how different factors come into play in the context of best practices of e-learning. The research aimed to help build a robust approach to the phenomenon. A dominant quantitative and less dominant qualitative method using survey approach was adopted. A total of 2,718 undergraduate students of the School of Social Sciences at two campuses of the University of KwaZulu-Natal, UKZN, South Africa participated in the survey. The theoretical framework adopted to underpin the research was the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology Model (UTAUT). The findings identified the criticality of factors such as perceived ease of use, complexity, ease of use, attitude, subjective norm, social factors and image to best practices of e-learning. The significance of the study has the potential to impact on the policy, implementation and best practices of e-learning. Theoretically, the context of South Africa in contrast to early adopter countries was employed to advance the frontiers of global knowledge and improve an understanding of the UTAUT model to explain e-learning best practices.";"20737904";3;"Hong Kong";"Web of Science"

However, the benefit and implementation of such gaming platforms are not clearly studied. This analysis assesses the feasibility of Kahoot! regarding simplicity and low-cost performance as a learning/teaching tool for medical education in (histo-)pathology. Materials and Methods: In this feasibility pilot study, we developed 36 modules for different benign and malignant tumors, covering four major topics: gastrointestinal tract, dermatology, urogenital tract, and hematology. Each module included histomorphological text-based questions for education of 2nd-year medical students. The online gaming-platform Kahoot! was anonymously implemented before and after classical medical education which included discussions of histological slides for each tumor entity using Microsoft PowerPoint-based presentations in combination with microscopical demonstrations. Participating students were invited to a seven-questions evaluation about the online educational approach. Results: Overall, 23 of 51 students of the study class completed the pre- and the post-evaluation of Kahoot! in one or more organ systems. The percentage of correct answers increased from the initial mean/median of 47.2/45% to 77.2/76.3%. Simultaneously, the time for answering questions decreased by roughly 50% (from mean/median time of 9.1/8.3 seconds to 5.1/4.3 seconds) from pre- to post-assessment. The results were independent of gender; however, there were scoring differences between the different organ systems. Students positively evaluated the routine implementation of the gaming-platform Kahoot! within medical education. Conclusion: Kahoot! is as a simple, direct, and low-cost application in medical teaching improving learning outcomes of pathomorphological topics with high acceptance by students. Kahoot!-based evaluations should be also performed in more advanced topics in the field of histopathology.";"11797258";0;"New Zealand";"Web of Science"

However, these and other applications of technology to mediate language learning may be informed by reflecting not only on the present but perhaps more importantly on relevant insights from past research and practice. This article draws on selected studies and the author's experience to lay out five key lessons learned over more than three decades in CALL. These lessons involve understanding: 1) the cycle of technology adoption; 2) the dimensions of technology mediation in the language learning process; 3) the promise and limitations of CALL research; 4) the critical importance of teacher education and professional development in an age of continuous change; and 5) the need for learner training for effective technology use. Teachers, researchers, and developers alike are encouraged to reflect on these lessons as they create and seek to control the technologies, tasks, and activities of the future.";"21557098";4;"USA";"Web of Science"

In this context, we find a new teaching-learning model such as the flipped classroom (Bergmann and Sams, 2012). This methodology assumes that class time in the classroom is devoted to applying, experimenting, researching, etc.; that is, working at the highest levels of Bloom's taxonomy. To do this, the teacher must develop different practices or activities that serve the student to reinforce what was previously learned at home and that, following Santiago and Bergmann (2018) can be included within, among others, the following categories: peer-to-peer teaching, project-based learning, case studies, simulations, roleplaying, cooperative learning and gamification. In this paper, we present the students' assessment of the different techniques used when inverting the classroom in two subjects related to business management. More specifically, we analyze the degree of interest and fun they have aroused in them, as well as the extent to which each of these techniques has made them participate more actively, has improved the relationship with peers and with the teacher and has contributed to a greater understanding of the subject. The results show that the three methodologies best valued by the students are: gamification, role-playing and project-based learning.";"02138964";0;"Spain";"Web of Science"

The application of MOOCs has technological but also pedagogical implications. MOOCs are usually driven by short video lessons, automatic correction exercises, and the technological platforms can implement gamification or learning analytics techniques. However, much more analysis is required about the success or failure of these initiatives in order to know if this new MOOCs paradigm is appropriate for different learning situations. This work aims at analyzing and reporting whether the introduction of MOOCs technology was good or not in a case study with the Khan Academy platform at our university with students in a remedial Physics course in engineering education. Results show that students improved their grades significantly when using MOOCs technology, student satisfaction was high regarding the experience and for most of the different provided features, and there were good levels of interaction with the platform (e.g., number of completed videos or proficient exercises), and also the activity distribution for the different topics and types of activities was appropriate.

It has been enthusiastically employed in various fields such as web-based businesses, health, wellness, and has been widely researched in the field of education. While many of the pioneer studies revealed positive effects of gamification for learning, more inconclusive and even negative effects have been reported in subsequent research. It is also uncertain whether the positive outcomes are sustainable and not limited to just novelty effects. Studies in this field continue to mature and the thrust is to move beyond the preliminary and often vague question of Does gamification work? to more specific inquiries like Why does gamification work?, What is gamification's effect? or How to make gamification work? In order for the knowledge gains from research studies to be synthesizable, there has been a call for gamification approaches to be based upon established psychological, behavioural or learning theories instead of ad hoc methods. This paper responds to this need by presenting a gamification framework that is based on the well-established motivational theory, the Self-Determination Theory (SDT). The SDT addresses motivation through the distinction of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. In order to foster authentic learning motivations, gamification should be designed to affect intrinsic motivation for the learning activity itself. This paper outlines how this can be achieved by strategically employing game dynamics and components to meet the psychological needs that support intrinsic motivation.";"18234690";3;"Malaysia";"Web of Science"

It has a serious impact on the child's personality, upbringing, education, socialization, development, and academic success from the preschool period to the university and beyond. In general, traditional teaching methods usually have a fixed learning structure which disables the child to be motivated, creative and innovative. Learners receive theoretical rather than practical instructions, which discourage them from keeping and recalling concepts and information more quickly. Moreover, traditional teaching usually lacks attracting the full attention of learners which decreases their interaction, engagement and investment in the content. Thus, the development of innovative approaches offering better education is an effective way to address this problem. On the other hand, recent researches in the fields of cognitive science and educational neuroscience show that play-based learning is a promising approach to use in early childhood education. Four key success factors for learning have been identified to strengthen children's skills, namely attention, active engagement, feedback, and consolidation. Thus, the proposed approach presents a digital play-based learning approach deploying serious games augmenting the pedagogical aspect of the Montessori approach. Our purpose is to improve children's skills in their early years education through play-based learning and gamification. It aims to provide children with a rich variety of serious gaming activities and challenging experiences in an interactive environment. We developed several serious games based on Montessori pedagogical principal and the four pillars of learning. For the evaluation, we have chosen a representative sample of children from rural regions.";"18200214";1;"Serbia";"Web of Science"

To meet this need, the objectives of this study were: to design a competition-based game in the virtual world, Second Life and to analyze the students' perceptions of Second Life and the game, as well as to analyze the medium-term retention of knowledge and the potential impact on the final grades. Ninety out of 197 (45.6%) third-year medical students voluntarily participated in an online game based on self-guided presentations and multiple-choice tests over six 6-day stages. Participants and non-participants were invited to perform an evaluation questionnaire about the experience and a post-exposure knowledge test. Participants rated the experience with mean scores equal to or higher than 8.1 on a 10-point scale, highlighting the professor (9.5 +/- 1.1; mean +/- SD) and the virtual environment (8.9 +/- 1.1). Participants had better results in the post-exposure test than non-participants (59.0 +/- 13.5 versus 45.3 +/- 11.5; P < 0.001) and a lower percentage of answers left blank (6.7 +/- 8.4 versus 13.1 +/- 12.9; P = 0.014). Competitive game-based learning within Second Life is an effective and well-accepted means of teaching core radiological anatomy and radiological signs content to medical students. The higher medium-term outcomes obtained by participants may indicate effective learning with the game. Additionally, valuable positive perceptions about the game, the educational contents, and the potential benefit for their education were discovered among non-participants.";"19359772";1;"USA";"Web of Science"

The use of game mechanics in non-ludic environments (Gamification) has begun to be of great interest in research, since it could increase the motivation and therefore the activity of the students. This study tries to verify if there is an existing relationship between gamification and a possible increase in student activity or between the cessation of gamification and student activity. In addition, it evaluates whether a greater student activity corresponds to a greater learning improvement. In the obtained results, no significant differences were found between the methodology or the activity with a learning improvement. According to the study, the simple use of gamified elements does not necessarily imply a solution to the problems posed. The students & x2019; activity in a course of these characteristics does not imply a better learning improvement, the importance lies in the quality of the activity generated and not in the quantity.";"21693536";2;"USA";"Web of Science"

Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research strategy was used with a sample of 220 respondents. These respondents were tested before and after the gamification experience. Findings Main findings support literature suggesting a clear effect of attitudes towards behaviour and perceived behavioural control on EI, in line with the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Once the basic assumptions of TPB were confirmed, the authors tested the effects of gamification comparing before and after results. Main findings highlight an increase of these effects after the gamification experience, aligned with the self-determination theory. Practical implications - These findings suggest that gamification is able to influence entrepreneurial behaviours. This contributes to both companies and educators' knowledge on training for EI with gamification and the use of online platforms to this effect. Recommendations are provided. Originality/value This is the first study that investigates the impact of gamification on EI and how gamification can influence the different relationships between the antecedents of EI.";"14626004";7;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

The phenomenon of gamification is ambiguous and complex, and the fact that more and more spheres of human activity get signs of the game is of great concern. Though game and play activity is typical to humans, it has always created numerous risks and destructive situations. So, we argue that the ambiguity of the perception of the phenomenon of gamification is caused by the difficulties of understanding it, modern historical conditions and social practices that strongly influence and distort ideas about gamification. The aim of the article is to study the role of gamification on a specific example of using computer games for teaching philosophy in technical institutions of higher education. Game practices activate and educate emotional intelligence. It is especially necessary for students of technical institutions of higher education. The purpose of the analysis is to define both the positive and negative consequences of using games and to suggest a way to overcome possible destructive results. In the course of the research of this problem, the author concentrated on objective, historical and social analysis. Practical approach to methods of terminological analysis, ways of defining and choosing games, are particularly stressed. Looking for methods to overcame negative consequences of gamification, when using games in teaching, we stress the importance of philosophical approach. Because namely systemic, interdisciplinary analysis takes into account many factors of risk and influence of gamification. We suggest that in-deep analysis of compatibility and value of game technologies in teaching philosophy may be useful for overcoming possible negative consequences of gamification in education and training. We also consider that first priority should be given to comprehensive research and definition of methods for assessing the relevance, effectiveness, and even economic feasibility of using game technology for teaching and learning academic subject, as well as for specific topics.";"20768184";2;"Ukraine";"Web of Science"

We carried out a quasi-experimental study with two groups in a Database course. One group used a gamified version of QueryCompetition having access to points and leaderboards, while the other used a non-gamified version with no access to the above mentioned elements. Quantitative and qualitative datawere collected through tests and a survey. The results showed that there was a statistically significant improvement in student performance in the gamified group as compared to the non-gamified group. In addition, a higher motivationwas observed in the gamified group.

This paper seeks to contribute to solving this shortcoming by connecting the application of the educational gamification carried out in the Distance Public Accounting Program of the Universidad Militar Nueva Granada (Colombia) with the theoretical foundations of the subject. To this end, researchers addressed the differences between gamification and game-based learning, examined the concept, objectives, contributions, and elements of the gamification, and identified the key aspects for a successful implementation in the educational context. Finally, they explained the process of gamification implemented from the teacher planning to the analysis of student opinions. For this, the methodology used was an exploratory one supported in documentary analysis and application of surveys to students. As a result of the application, researchers verified that educational gamification promotes autonomy, motivation, commitment, and social interaction in the students, allowing the progression and mastery of the issues covered in each proposed challenge.";"01244639";0;"Colombia";"Web of Science"

When applied in education, it is an approach to motivate and engage students in their learning process by incorporating game design principles. This paper presents the design and deployment of a game conducted in parallel with two groups of the engineering course operations research. The game design is theoretically supported, and unlike literature, the game proposed has the main distinguishing features: (a) it is carried out in parallel with the standard course, where player participation is optional, with extrinsic motivators regarding the final grade, (b) it lasts the entire semester, and it was applied to different groups with the same instructor, (c) in addition to academic performance, it has other social relatedness desired outcomes, (d) it combines the use of specific game elements divided in three types of activities: Mastery, related to the core topics of the class, Institutional, related to the university life and community, and Teamwork activities; and (e) it uses a WhatsApp chat group as the common communication platform. The assessment is twofold: the effects on learning, measured in two indicators, failure rate and average grade; and the perception of the game itself. Statistical results present empirical evidence of the positive effects of gamification on academic performance and other desired behaviors of social relatedness, such as a sense of belonging and teamwork.";"24058440";2;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

Its characteristics of being free, heterogeneous, multi-thematic, and fostering lifelong learning have completely changed the instructional design scene, allowing these innovations and new architectures of teaching and learning to be included. However, MOOCs have been criticized by the scientific community for their high dropout rates and low overall completion rates, which has called into question their effectiveness as a pedagogical tool. This paper analyzes how the application of gamification strategies in MOOCs on energy sustainability affects participants' engagement and seeks to identify what types of interactive gamification media are more useful in generating interest and motivation in students. In order to do so, a mixed quasi-experimental method is used. A gamification board with challenges, badges, and leaderboards to a sample is used, and at the same time, this platform is analyzed using the integrated theoretical gamification model in e-learning environments. In the MOOCs where gamification strategies were applied, a global completion rate of 14.43% was obtained, while in those without gamification, 6.162% was obtained. Likewise, the degree of student engagement with respect to the completion rate of activities was much higher in the gamified platform (28.032%) than in the traditional design (13.252%). The results show that applying gamification strategies in MOOCs achieves a higher level of engagement and student motivation.";"21693536";14;"USA";"Web of Science"

The purpose of this study is to validate an electronic learning or e-learning, concept featuring gamification elements, rapid case reading, and instant feedback. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. An c-learning concept was devised that offered game levels for the purpose of providing training in the detection of pneumothorax in 195 cases, with questions read in rapid succession and instant feedback provided for each case. The user's task was to locate the pneumothorax on chest radiographs and indicate its presence by clicking a mouse. The game level design included an entry test consisting of 15 cases, training levels with increasing difficulty that involved 150 cases, and a final test that including 30 cases (the 15 cases from the entry test plus 15 new cases). A total of 126 candidates were invited via e-mail to participate and were asked to complete a survey before and after playing the game, which is known as RapRad. The level of diagnostic confidence and the error rate before and after playing the game were compared using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS. Fifty-nine of 126 participants (47%) responded to the first survey and finished the game. Of these 59 participants, 29 (49%) responded to the second survey after completing the game. Diagnostic confidence in pneumothorax detection improved significantly, from a mean (+/- SD) score of 4.3 +/- 2.1 on the entry test to a final score of 7.3 +/- 2.1 (p < 0.01) after playing RapRad, with the score measured on a 10-point scale, with 10 denoting the highest possible score. Of the participants, 93% indicated that they would use the game for learning purposes again, and 87% indicated that they had fun using RapRad (7% had a neutral response and 6% had a negative response). The error rate (i.e., the number of failed attempts to answer a question correctly) significantly decreased from 39% for the entry test to 22% for the final test (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION.

Game-based learning environments are designed to teach specific knowledge content and skill-based learning outcomes using game elements. One main reason for using game-based learning environments is to increase student motivation and engagement while teaching learning outcomes. Many of the game-based learning environments are designed so that students will reach maximum flow, which is defined as students being so completely immersed in that game that they do not notice that they are learning. These learning environments have been shown to improve many behaviour and cognitive learning outcomes. While game-based learning has many benefits, some educational researchers have indicated that it is often very costly to develop a complex game-based assessment to teach a few learning outcomes. Hence, in some cases it is more beneficial to approach the use of computer games in education using gamification.";"21556849";1;"USA";"Web of Science"

Health professions educators increasingly turn to gamification to optimize students' learning outcomes. However, little is known about the concept of gamification and its possible working mechanisms. This review focused on empirical evidence for the effectiveness of gamification approaches and theoretical rationales for applying the chosen game attributes. We systematically searched multiple databases, and included all empirical studies evaluating the use of game attributes in health professions education. Of 5044 articles initially identified, 44 met the inclusion criteria. Negative outcomes for using gamification were not reported. Almost all studies included assessment attributes (n = 40), mostly in combination with conflict/challenge attributes (n = 27). Eight studies revealed that this specific combination had increased the use of the learning material, sometimes leading to improved learning outcomes. A relatively small number of studies was performed to explain mechanisms underlying the use of game attributes (n = 7). Our findings suggest that it is possible to improve learning outcomes in health professions education by using gamification, especially when employing game attributes that improve learning behaviours and attitudes towards learning. However, most studies lacked well-defined control groups and did not apply and/or report theory to understand underlying processes. Future research should clarify mechanisms underlying gamified educational interventions and explore theories that could explain the effects of these interventions on learning outcomes, using well-defined control groups, in a longitudinal way. In doing so, we can build on existing theories and gain a practical and comprehensive understanding of how to select the right game elements for the right educational context and the right type of student.";"13824996";0;"Netherlands";"Web of Science"

But even with access to virtual 3D models, motivation is a key element for successful learning and for progressing over a longer period of time. Mixed reality spaces offer new opportunities for combining a 3D stereoscopic depth perception of anatomic models together with gamification and interactive learning. Virtual 3D models can be enhanced with additional information which can name and explain separate elements. Therefore, we developed GaMR, a gamified framework for learning in mixed reality, where 3D models can be experienced on the Microsoft HoloLens and the HTC Vive. Quiz creation is supported by placing annotations on the model. Progress is rewarded by badges. The gamification strategy guides the student and gives feedback about the learning progress. This open source gamification framework for mixed reality was evaluated with students and doctors from a medical university. It showed that it can be employed in many academic and industrial use cases.";"0948695X";0;"Austria";"Web of Science"

Thus, structural readjustment of the teaching organization is urgently needed. Increasing proportions of gamifying teaching and experiencing teaching is an effective way to solve this problem. However, only a few studies have discussed the gamification of teaching reform in colleges. To improve the effectiveness of teaching and increase the participation of students in classrooms, the teaching reform idea and scheme of gamifying teaching and experiencing teaching were discussed in a course entitled Layout and Management of Distribution Center. The teaching reform aims to integrate comprehensive gamifying into the teaching of an entire curriculum. Specifically, small games are designed in each class during the early period to help the students learn the corresponding knowledge in games. A game-driven model of curriculum design was proposed and applied in teaching reform practice of Shijiazhuang Posts and Telecommunications Technical College. Results demonstrated that gamification of teaching reform achieves outstanding effects. Students participate in classroom activities positively, and all evaluation indexes improve year by year. Results confirm that teachers need to pay attention to systemization, gamification, and immersion of teaching design, and ensure the attractiveness and acceptability of the teaching method.";"18630383";6;"Germany";"Web of Science"

Commonly, judgmental forecasting is taught in forecasting courses syllabi, and the pedagogy surrounding it is challenging. However, gamification and game-based learning have risen as promising tools to simulate different kinds of scenarios and stimulate cognitive problem solving. This study investigates the effects of a gamified application with points, levels, challenges, storytelling and leaderboard for teaching judgmental forecasting by conducting a 2 x 2 between-subjects experiment (treatments: i) read: yes vs no, and ii) gamification: yes vs no), with a sample of 285 students of a School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and a Business Administration Department. The findings indicate that the gamified application improved learning outcomes regarding the heuristics and biases that affect judgmental forecasting by almost 15%, supporting the use of gamification in forecasting education.";"00401625";0;"USA";"Web of Science"

To test whether gamification could be used to engage low-motivation smokers, we conceptualized Take a Break - a 3-week technology-assisted challenge for smokers to compete in setting and achieving brief abstinence goals. Materials and Methods: In the feasibility study of the multi-technology Take a Break challenge, low-motivation smokers were given (1) daily motivational messages, (2) brief challenge quizzes related to smoking behaviors, (3) a telehealth call to personalize their abstinence goal for the challenge, (4) coping minigames to help manage cravings while attempting to achieve their brief abstinence goals, and (5) a leaderboard webApp, providing comparative feedback on smokers' participation, and allowing for competition. Heterogeneity of engagement was tracked. Results: All 41 smokers initially reported that they were not actively quitting. Over half were employed less than full time (51%), completed less than a 4-year college education (76%), and experienced financial stress (54%). No smokers opted out of the motivational messages, and mean proportion of response to the challenge quizzes was 0.88 (SD = 0.19). Half of the smokers reported using the coping minigames. Almost all set abstinence goals (78%), with over half lasting 1-2 days (51%); median = 1 day (IQR 1-7). Leaderboard points ranged widely. Conclusions: Rates of smoking in the developed world have declined, and those who remain smokers are complex and have lower motivation to quit.

In domains such as education, marketing and health, where gamification techniques are applied, user engagement in applications has increased. In these applications the protection of users' privacy is an important aspect to consider, due to the applications obtaining a record of the personal information of their users. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to identify if applications where gamification is applied do respect users' privacy. For the accomplishment of this aim, two main steps have been implemented. Since the main principle of gamification is the existence of game elements, the first step was to identify the set of game elements recorded in the literature that are commonly applied in various applications. Afterwards, an examination of the relationship between these elements and privacy requirements was implemented in order to identify which elements conflict with the privacy requirements leading to potential privacy violations and which elements do not. Alpha conceptual model according to the results of this examination was designed, which presents how elements conflict with requirements. Based on the results, there are indeed game elements which can lead to privacy violations. The results of this work provide valuable guidance to software developers, especially during the design stages of gamified applications since it helps them to consider the protection of users' privacy in parallel from the early stages of the application development onwards.";"19995903";4;"Switzerland";"Web of Science"

This article intends to present the concept of Gamification as a multimodal alternative for education, considering it a relatively recent initiative. It is a phenomenon still in its infancy, lacking in more studies and discussions, but not less interesting, since it proposes a new approach to education and many other segments of contemporary human knowledge. Method. The research shows that in Higher Education, as in other areas, its use is still incipient, because the controversy surrounding the theme is still considerable, however, it joins efforts with other proposals of the same magnitude, in an attempt to sublimate some of the learning problems of the individuals, leading them to the engagement and motivation in the educational environment. It is not a revolution, or a proposal to abandon pre-existing concepts and procedures, but an attempt to compose with what already exists and to take advantage of the benefits of evolution through which humanity passes, so that learning becomes increasingly more natural in the eyes of individuals.

In higher education, gamification is a methodology intending to motivate students to acquire academical knowledge and soft skills, while keeping them engaged and pleased with the learning process. This study reports the application of a gamified class concerning electric resistors, the first of a 12-topic discipline offered to 2nd-year students in physics and engineering. Adopting a Flipped Classroom methodology and a narrative based on household power consumption, traditional contents about resistors and electricity were taught. Also, instructions about how to use an ohm-meter and how to configure an electronic spreadsheet to do basic statistics were given. In order to customize and enrich the class, some optional contents (usually in a video) were made available. The access to the experimental activities was constrained by approval in four graded quizzes. Every activity was acknowledged by virtual coins to be converted in benefits (extra time to run final examinations, permission to consult class appointments and the opportunity to re-discuss a mistake in the final examination) and points, to rank students (leaderboard). Forty-five students attended the gamified class. No control group was implemented because this study aimed to find a good design for a gamified class, not to compare traditional to active methodologies. The overall student acceptance was excellent, and they reported that gamification can be a more engaging methodology than traditional classes, further developing soft skills and academic knowledge. However, the time spent to run the gamified class must be arranged, reducing the time inside the classroom. The opportunity to perform the experiment was considered essential, and could not be substituted by videos or texts since new doubts and concerns are pointed out during the practice when the teacher is present. Gamification can be a methodology capable of engaging and being enjoyable students, giving them more than just information but also soft skills.";"01430807";4;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

The intended goal of implementing this framework is to improve learner engagement and foster greater learner investment in the course. The framework, developed at the University of Waterloo, was integrated into the course design for-and subsequently taught in-a third-year history course. A mixed-methods analysis was conducted in which students (n = 15) were surveyed, interviewed, and observed throughout the course at different intervals.

However, the motivations driving individuals' learning behavior differ from their motivations when playing. There is no evidence that learners' experiences in gamified activities are described by these models. Thus, an alternative model capturing learners' motivational experiences and relating them to the motivational mechanisms of gamification design is needed. To fill this gap we propose a context-specific typology which groups learners based on their type of motivation and perceived ability associated with a learning activity. The purpose of this proposal is to provide a framework for connecting each learner's type to a set of motivational affordances to which that type is susceptible. Facilitating the task of selecting motivational affordances matching learner's type aids the design of customized gamified learning.";"23659440";0;"UNITED STATES";"Web of Science"

The interface is designed to appeal to Pacific people, a population group with a higher risk of developing clinically significant behavioral problems than most other ethnic groups in New Zealand. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the opinions of parents and professionals about the acceptability, usability, and content of Play Kindly. Methods: We used qualitative and Pacific and Maori research methodologies. A total of five focus groups with 45 parents and 12 individual interviews with professionals were conducted. The five focus groups consisted of 2 pan-Pacific groups, 1 Maori group, 1 open group, and 1 group of young Pacific adults or prospective parents. The professionals were from a range of disciplines, and the majority had expertise in early childhood, parenting interventions, or research in this field. Results: Play Kindly appealed to both parents and professionals. Participants related to the scenarios, which were created in collaboration with a playwright and animator. Although most participants liked the Pacific feel, there was some disagreement about how culturally specific the app should be. A range of issues with usability and gamification techniques were highlighted, likely attributed to the low budget and lack of initial co-design with parents as well as professionals with specific expertise in parenting. A number of parents and professionals felt that the parenting strategies were overly simplified and did not take into account the context in which the behavior occurred. Professionals suggested narrowing the focus of the app to deliver two important parenting messages: playing with your child and positively reinforcing desired behaviors. Conclusions: Play Kindly is the first culturally adapted parenting app of its kind designed for Pacific parents and other New Zealanders with children 2-5 years of age. This app has potential in Pacific communities where there are limited culturally specific parenting resources. The results of this study will guide improvements of the app prior to testing it in an open trial.";"22919279";0;"Canada";"Web of Science"

The following conclusions were inferred: By turning learning into a game we may prompt students to perceive the world-of-work (duties, responsibilities) as the world-of-play (desires, freedom); then, either the school will lose its socializing role in preparing students for life, which is a world of work and commitments rather than a world of game, or students will become bored with the game that will lose its appeal (or suggest manipulations).

Self-management support is an important component of chronic illness care and is a key pillar of the chronic care model. Face-to-face teaching and patient education materials suffer from being static or incompatible with mobile lifestyles. Digital apps provide a self-management support alternative that is convenient and scalable. Objective: This pilot study tested the real-world deployment of a self-guided mobile app for diabetes education (Time2Focus app; MicroMass Communications Inc, Cary, NC), which utilizes evidence-based content and gamification to deliver an interactive learning experience. Methods: Primary care providers were approached for permission to invite their patients to participate. Eligible patients were 18 to 89 years of age, had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) >= 8% and <12% in the past 3 months, an active online patient portal account (tied to the electronic health record), and access to an iOS or Android smartphone. Interested patients were emailed a baseline survey, and once this was completed, were sent instructions for downloading the Time2Focus app. After completing all 12 levels, participants were sent a follow-up survey. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes included medication adherence, self-care activities, self-reporting of physical activities, diabetes self-efficacy, illness perceptions, diabetes distress scale, and users' engagement with and rating of the app. Results: Of 1355 potentially eligible patients screened, 201 were consented. Of these 201 patients, 101 (50.2%) did not download the app. Of the 100 participants (49.8%) who downloaded the app, 16 (16.0%) completed 0 levels, 26 (26.0%) completed 1 to 4 levels, 10 (10.0%) completed 5 to 11 levels, and 48 (48.0%) completed all 12 levels of the app and the follow-up survey. Those completing one or more levels had a mean pre/post-HbA1c change of -0.41% (compared to -0.32% among those who completed zero levels); however, the unadjusted two-tailed t test indicated no significant difference between the two groups (P=.73). Diabetes self-efficacy showed a large and significant increase during app usage for completers (mean change 1.28, P<.001, d=.83). Severity of illness perceptions showed a small but significant decrease during app usage for completers (mean change -0.51, P=.004, d=.43). Diabetes distress showed a small but significant decrease during app usage for completers (mean change -0.45, P=.006, d=.41). The net promoter score was 62.5, indicating that those who completed all levels of the app rated it highly and would recommend it to others. Conclusions: Participants who engaged in all 12 levels of the Time2Focus mobile app showed an improvement in diabetes self-efficacy and a decrease in severity of illness perceptions. The decrease in HbA1c observed in app users relative to nonusers during this limited pilot study was not statistically significant. However, uptake and application of lessons learned from self-management support may be delayed. Further research is needed to address how to increase engagement through self-management support and to investigate if follow up over a longer period demonstrates a significant change in outcomes such as HbA1c.";"14388871";0;"Canada";"Web of Science"

We summarized twelve practical educational advices regarding: lecture contents, delivery and performance of the lecture content, flipped classrooms, changing roles during academic lectures, mini-lectures and micro-learning, gamification and student engagement tools, virtual patient simulations, surgical simulators, language and communication, feedback, mentorship and holistic approaches. The education of Gen Z should take place in settings and formats as digitally enhanced as their daily environments and circumstances, which requires teachers to master digital tools themselves and to engage more with social media as part of their relationship with Gen Z students.";"15833410";1;"Romania";"Web of Science"

Global populations live increasingly in urban landscapes, which creates an 'extinction of experience' when interacting with nature. In 2018, we facilitated 8 workshops with students aged 13 to 17 from two Maori immersion schools (Wharekura) to explore the application and implementation of a cultural monitoring framework. Although initial workshops demonstrated it was possible to apply the cultural monitoring method across ecosystems, the absence of basic ecological literacy was a significant challenge. We observed that uptake and understanding of basic environmental knowledge and ecological literacy increased markedly when we used gamification. We tested the potential of technology to enable pro-environmental behaviour and increase environmental literacy and indigenous knowledge to support student's connection to the natural world. Over the duration of this study, we developed a basic New Zealand ecology game, called Eko. The game fuses basic ecological concepts with indigenous Maori knowledge to provide a holistic view of the environment. Our survey results show that 90% of the students found our game entertaining, while 65% reported new knowledge acquisition. Our research revealed that while 'extinction of experience' in this area is rising globally, technology can be used as a mechanism to facilitate an increase in ecological literacy, indigenous knowledge, and pro-environmental behaviours. Our challenge in reversing the disconnection between our youth and the natural world is to explore the void between environment, technology, and indigenous knowledge. People should therefore be encouraged to explore how technological innovation can augment holistic solutions when connecting youth with their natural world.";"01106465";5;"New Zealand";"Web of Science"

Using Keller's ARCS model (1987) a research model is developed and tested via Partial Least Squares (PLS) on a sample of 128 undergraduate students enrolled in a private Higher Education institution in Spain. Main results suggest that perceived attention, perceived relevance, and perceived confidence influence in a direct and positive way students' attitude towards the use of online educational video games to develop their competencies. Both attention and confidence also affects students' perceived relevance of online educational video games as a suitable means to develop their competencies.

However, it is not clear whether the rule affects working time or not. For example, if we apply a time limit to impatient developers, the working time may become shorter, but the rule may negatively affect because of pressure for time. In this study, we analyze with subjective experiments whether the rules affects work results such as working time.

Students become engaged and motivated - they learn so much more than in the traditional system. Conducting lessons becomes a pleasure, an adventure, a catharsis! While checking attendance, participation, quizzes, tasks, assignments, projects, missions, and quests on a daily basis is a bliss. Unfortunately, that is not true. That is only a dream or part of the advertising campaign of yet another so-called professional or seasoned gamifier. Preparing, organising, and designing gamified courses are not a stroll in a park. Every teacher must forsake leisure and family time alike unless they have ample support from colleagues, administration, and IT department. The purpose of this paper is to present the author's approach to gamification and share some insight into the author's experience from designing gamified courses and workshops since 2009. Design/methodology/approach - This paper concentrates on hands-on experience, mistakes, and solutions in order to approach a major issue: should we introduce gamification in education at all? Findings - In reality, gamification can be the root of all evil if done too hastily, too cheerfully, and without prior understanding of students' needs, school facilities, and our own abilities. Gamifying a classroom (or a whole school) is a massive project which should be managed with all risks, weaknesses, and threats possible to imagine. That is why, it is advisable to know what to expect, what to fear, and what to avoid in order to choose the path of righteousness, to master the trade, and to reach everlasting glory. When discussing gamification in education, we must face reality, we need to understand what gamification can provide, but also what it can devour. Educational milieu is too sensitive and our students are too precious to apply unverified solutions without the adequate preparations. Originality/value - The author offers a few answers to the question as well as a handful of suggestions towards the successful introduction of gamification in education.";"20425953";1;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

Few patients persistently engage long-term to improve health outcomes, even when they are aware of the consequences of poor adherence. Despite the potential of mobile phone apps as a tool to manage medication adherence, there is still limited evidence of the impact of these innovative interventions. Real-world evidence can assist in minimizing this evidence gap. Objective: The objective of this study was to analyze the impact over time of a previously implemented digital therapeutic mobile app on medication adherence rates in adults with any chronic condition. Methods: A retrospective observational study was performed to assess the adherence rates of patients with any chronic condition using Perx Health, a digital therapeutic that uses multiple components within a mobile health app to improve medication adherence. These components include gamification, dosage reminders, incentives, educational components, and social community components. Adherence was measured through mobile direct observation of therapy (MDOT) over 3-month and 6-month time periods. Implementation adherence, defined as the percentage of doses in which the correct dose of a medication was taken, was assessed across the study periods, in addition to timing adherence or percentage of doses taken at the appropriate time (+/- 1 hour). The Friedman test was used to compare differences in adherence rates over time. Results: We analyzed 243 and 130 patients who used the app for 3 months and 6 months, respectively. The average age of the 243 patients was 43.8 years (SD 15.5), and 156 (64.2%) were female. The most common medications prescribed were varenicline, rosuvastatin, and cholecalciferol. The median implementation adherence was 96.6% (IQR 82.1%-100%) over 3 months and 96.8% (IQR 87.1%-100%) over 6 months Nonsignificant differences in adherence rates over time were observed in the 6-month analysis (Fr(2)=4.314, P=.505) and 3-month analysis (Fr(2)=0.635, P=.728). Similarly, the timing adherence analysis revealed stable trends with no significant changes over time. Conclusions: Retrospective analysis of users of a medication adherence management mobile app revealed a positive trend in maintaining optimal medication adherence over time.

The current curricula allow to overcome the traditional division between theory and practice in higher education teaching, artificial in formative terms. For this integration to be effective in the classroom dynamic, activities are required that effectively integrate theoretical knowledge with skills and abilities and that stimulate the independent work of the student. Objectives/hypotheses. This study focuses on analysing the satisfaction and subjective perception of achievement of competencies of university students after the implementation of active learning methodologies in a subject focused on physiological aspects of behaviour. Method. Active learning methodologies were implemented for 54 students (mean age: 24.17 years), including an experiment in the classroom, the case method, the development of gamification strategies and the strengthening of constructive alignment. At the end of the course, a satisfaction questionnaire was administered to the students. Results. The learning methodology was one of the aspects most highly valued by the students, followed by learning outcomes and, to a lesser extent, the acquisition of competences. Conclusions. The implementation of innovative learning methodologies in the university environment has been satisfactory for the students, to a different extent depending on the aspect considered.";"22545883";0;"Spain";"Web of Science"

This study investigates the extent to which game-based learning (GBL) and gamification could improve the sexual health education of adolescent students. We conducted a randomized control trial of GBL and gamification experimental conditions. We made a comparison with traditional teaching as a control condition in order to establish differences between the three teaching conditions. The sexual health education topics were delivered in a masked fashion, 40-min a week for five weeks. A mixed-method research approach was uses to assess and analyze the results for 120 students from a secondary school in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. Students were divided into groups of 40 for each of the three teaching methods: GBL, gamification, and the control group (the traditional teaching method). The average post-test scores for GBL (Mean = 79.94, SD = 11.169) and gamification (Mean = 79.23, SD = 9.186) were significantly higher than the control group Mean = 51.93, SD = 18.705 (F (2, 117) = 54.75, p = 0.001). Overall, statistically significant differences (p 0.05) were found for the constructs of Motivation, Attitude, Knowledge, and Engagement (MAKE). This study suggests that the two innovative teaching approaches can be used to improve the sexual health education of adolescent students. The methods can potentially contribute socially, particularly in improving sexual health behaviour and adolescents' knowledge in regions plagued by years of sexual health problems, including HIV/AIDS.";"16617827";12;"Switzerland";"Web of Science"

This increase in the popularity of digital games is mostly associated not only with the interesting designs of the digital games but also with the emotional satisfaction with these games. In recent years, this tendency towards digital games has led to the transfer of certain features of games to non-game contexts. The concept named gamification refers to the adaptation of game features to non-game contexts. Gamification has been in use in many areas in recent years. One of these areas is the field of education. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the effectiveness of elements of gamification in blended learning environments within the context of emotion, interest and online participation. In the study, the convergent parallel mixed design, which allowed explaining the quantitative and qualitative data in association with each other, was used. In this respect, the study was carried out with 63 university students (30 students in the experimental group and 33 students in the control group) in a period of 13 weeks. In the research process, the two groups of students were provided with the opportunity to experience the blended learning environment both on face-to-face basis and on online basis. The experimental group differed from the control group in terms of such gamification elements presented in face-to-face and online environments as being given directives, progress bar, badge, level, experience point, leader-board, award, completion rate, activity completion, activity restriction and activity feedback. According to the data collected in the study, gamification elements used in blended learning environments have caused the participants to develop both positive and negative emotions. In addition, it was revealed that gamification was found interesting by the participants Moreover, it was seen that there was a significant difference between the times spent by the groups in terms of their participation in online environment in favor of the experimental group.

This online tool is open access and free, which encourages teachers to reproduce the proposed methodology for their subjects. The methodological proposal is based on three principles: (i) the use of virtual resources in education; (ii) the effectiveness of collaborative learning; and (iii) the motivation that the gamification of the teaching-learning process awakens in students. The effectiveness of the methodology has been demonstrated by surveys to the students carried out before (pre-test) and after (post-test) an educational experience at two pre-university levels: Junior High School and High School. In the light of the results obtained, it has become evident that the proposed methodology favors: (i) the teaching-learning process, by raising the level of student engagement in the study of the subject; (ii) the resolution of multiple-choice tests with a more optimistic approach and self-confidence; (iii) students' greater predisposition for team work; and (iv) an entertaining and motivating educational environment.";"1138414X";5;"Spain";"Web of Science"

This study investigates whether the use of ERPsim games can be extended to other management disciplines. More specifically, this study reports on using the ERPsim games innovatively in a new context, in an undergraduate managerial decision making course, to enhance student perceived learning outcomes and satisfaction. Background In this study, the ERPsim games were used to provide students with practical experience about using information in tactical and operational decision making and to illustrate important course concepts such as anchoring, bias, and bounded awareness, among others. The theoretical framework leveraged in this study was derived from the literature on technology acceptance in educational settings and the studies on virtual learning environment effectiveness. Methodology Survey methodology was used to collect the data and test the research model. One sample t-tests and partial least squares (PLS) were used for empirical analysis. 138 students participated in the study. Contribution By developing and testing a sound research model, we conclude that the use of ERPsim games can be successfully extended from their current domain of Information Systems to management courses that are not technical to enhance student understanding of managerial concepts in a fun and enjoyable way while enabling students to gain realistic practical experience in using information for decision making. While, the ERPsim games have been used in IS education; this paper presents an opportunity to use them in a different context. Findings The study confirms that the ERPsim games are useful in improving student perceived learning outcomes and the level of satisfaction in management courses. It also identifies the factors that directly or indirectly shape student learning outcomes and satisfaction in such courses. Recommendations for Practitioners The use of the simulations has relevance to the new Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) guidelines that emphasize the need to incorporate evidence based, technology and data-driven decision making to solve real-world business problems into business curriculum. The study should also encourage educators to innovate in their own courses by experimenting with this particular simulation or similar simulations. Recommendation for Researchers Researchers should use additional samples to increase the generalizability of the findings. They should also extend the current research model by incorporating additional factors. Impact on Society The study provides support for the use of a simulation game to improve students' learning experiences and to help them better understand managerial decision making, which would allow graduates to more effectively transition into managerial roles.

Serious games are effective and innovative digital tools for educating patients about positive health behaviors. There are limited systematic reviews that examine the prevalence of serious games that incorporate medication use. Objective: This systematic review aimed to identify (1) serious games intended to educate patients about medication adherence, education, and safety; (2) types of theoretical frameworks used to develop serious games for medication use; and (3) sampling frames for evaluating serious games on medication use. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for literature about medication-based serious games for patients. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed for article selection. Results: Using PRISMA guidelines, 953 publications and 749 unique titles were identified from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. A total of 16 studies featuring 12 unique serious games were included with components of medication adherence, education, and safety, published from 2003 to 2019. Of the 12 games included, eight serious games were tested in adolescents, three games were tested in young adults, and one game was tested in adults. Most studies (n=11) used small sample sizes to test the usability of serious games. Theoretical frameworks identified in the 12 serious games included information, motivation, and behavior theory; social cognitive theory; precede-proceed model; middle-range theory of chronic illness; adult learning theory; experiential learning theory; and the theory of reasoned action. Existing reviews explore serious games focused on the management of specific disease states, such as HIV, diabetes, and asthma, and on the positive impact of serious game education in each respective disease state. Although other reviews target broad topics such as health care gamification and serious games to educate health care workers, no reviews focus solely on medication use. Serious games were mainly focused on improving adherence, whereas medication safety was not widely explored. Little is known about the efficacy and usability of medication-focused serious games often because of small and nonrepresentative sample sizes, which limit the generalizability of existing studies. Conclusions: Limited studies exist on serious games for health that incorporate medication use. The findings from these studies focus on developing and testing serious games that teach patients about medication use and safety. Many of these studies do not apply a theoretical framework in the design and assessment of these games. In the future, serious game effectiveness could be improved by increasing study sample size and diversity of study participants, so that the results are generalizable to broader populations. Serious games should describe the extent of theoretical framework incorporated into game design and evaluate success by testing the player's retention of learning objectives.";"22919279";2;"Canada";"Web of Science"

These problems relate to aspects of group dynamics including group cohesion, participation, communication, collaboration, and trust. Although the literature suggests various instructional techniques to increase group cohesion and learners' attitudes towards group learning environments, new methods and techniques should be explored in order to address and eliminate these problems. Gamification, which is the use of game elements and techniques in non-gaming environments, can be leveraged as a new method in order to increase group cohesion and group performance within collaborative learning environments. The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of gamification (both online and face-to-face) on the attitudes of students towards group learning environments, their course, group cohesion, and their academic achievement. The study aims to promote learners' collaboration in groups utilizing gamification elements. In this quasi-experimental design study, gamified (44 students) and traditional (48 students) groups were compared. Although no significant difference was established between the gamified and traditional groups in terms of students' attitudes towards group learning environments and the course, the gamified group outperformed the traditional group in terms of group cohesion scores and team member evaluation scores.";"87563894";3;"Switzerland";"Web of Science"

This instructional approach is appealing because it can free up class time for knowledge application activities with help from the instructor and peers. However, its implementation can be fraught with challenges. Student disengagement in out-of-class activities, for example, is one of the major challenges of flipped learning. The purpose of this study is to examine whether gamification can enhance student engagement in a flipped course. A comparison study was conducted, involving two classes of undergraduate students in an Information Management course. The results indicated that students in the gamification-enhanced flipped learning group (n = 48) were more likely to complete the preclass and post-class activities on time than those in the non-gamified flipped learning group (n = 48). Students in the gamification-enhanced flipped learning group also produced higher quality artifacts than the non-gamified flipped learning group in the pre-class thinking activities. Moreover, students in the gamification-enhanced flipped learning group scored significantly higher in the post-course test than did their non-gamified counterparts.";"10494820";61;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

This uncertain environment does not foster student effort and it is behind the important rates of abandon in higher education. The Bologna Process was thought to create a new paradigm in higher education in the European Union. However, the changes came from the top (governments) to the bottom (lectures and students) so they were not properly supported by specialized training oriented to lecturers. It did not include the appropriate changes in lower education stages (secondary education) to prepare student when facing University. Therefore, in the past decade several new teaching methodologies have appeared to deal with student demotivation and to fight against dropouts. Those methodologies try to keep the students engaged during the whole course paying more attention to their learning process, attitudes, motivations and expectations. Consequently, in this paper, we present a four-year experiment whose main objective is to keep students engaged during the whole year and to foster their motivation in order to increase their learning outcomes. The experiment is based on the application of gamification to the assessment process emulating a traditional platform video-game, like Super Mario. The results show that this experiment was positive for most students who achieved good marks and good rates of task completion.";"21693536";2;"USA";"Web of Science"

This work presents a gamification experience within prospective primary teachers in a General Science Classroom. A scoring game-based methodology was used for teaching Matter and Energy contents. In an effort for promoting collaborative dynamics rather than competitive ones in the entire group, a new variable was introduced once the game was started. It was called Game-Index and took into account the scoring of the whole class, similarly to H-Index. The results evidenced the need for these correcting measures in the gamifications processes, since a positive correlation amongst scoring and academic marks was confirmed, but also some kind of competitive-by segreggation inside the class group.";"18711871";31;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

With the growing push for creativity in the classroom as well as the application of effective technology in teaching and learning, it can be a daunting task for educators to find fitting competitive or game-based learning platforms. Foremost, educators need to consider elements such as motivation and whether the platform is likely to foster and reinforce learning. In the present study, a cohort of undergraduates at a public university in Malaysia were exposed to the use of Kahoot!, a game-based learning platform, during their weekly lectures for one semester. The participants were students of English for the Media, which covers theoretical and practical dimensions. The latter dimension includes the learning and application of media language features and devices. Survey data (51 respondents) on the whole, indicated that the students found Kahoot! to be beneficial in terms of: 1) inducing motivation as well as engagement, and 2) fostering and reinforcing learning (for both theoretical and practical aspects). The 33-item questionnaire created by the researchers was also tested for reliability, with returned values indicating high internal consistency, thus making the instrument a reliable option for use in future studies.

To capitalize on the promise of serious games in health care education, it is important for instructional designers to understand the underlying learners' values, attitudes, and beliefs that might motivate nongaming female health care preprofessional students to independently choose to persistently play serious games to mastery. Objective: Specifically, the aim of this study was to seek answers to 2 questions. First, what values, attitudes, and beliefs contribute to the nongaming behaviors of 12th-grade female emerging health care preprofessionals? Second, how do the values, attitudes, and beliefs of 12th-grade female emerging health care preprofessionals align with important design features of serious games? Methods: In this study, a learner analysis was conducted using semistructured interviews with 8 12th-grade college-bound female health science students to better understand learners' values, attitudes, and beliefs to inform the design and development of a serious game. These interviewees represented a diverse subset of the female emerging health care preprofessionals who self-identified themselves as not playing games at all, not very often, or infrequently. Results: The findings suggest that the study participants exhibited a complex fusion of desire for both accomplishment and affiliation. The participants were all independent, competitive, and prosocial leaders. They thought strategically and consciously self-limited their leisure time to achieve personally meaningful long-term goals. They embraced overcoming expected failures and aimed to achieve relevant high-stakes wins in all academic, athletic, extracurricular, and leisure activities they valued while consciously avoiding what they considered to be non-goal-oriented activities. Conclusions: The results of this study reinforce the need for a robust learner analysis to identify the multifaceted behavioral characteristics of targeted learners before the design and development of serious games. The common characteristics of the 12th-grade female health science students in this study suggest that they will choose to invest their limited leisure time playing a personally meaningful, preprofessionally authentic serious game if the collective design elements are aligned with the students' self-conceptualization of their present or future selves.";"22919279";2;"Canada";"Web of Science"

This raises to surface what many studies have addressed earlier; creating a platform that completes the traditional classroom work and maximizes the effectiveness of learning outcomes. Striving to achieve such platform, studies have considered gamifying and personalizing the educational resources for the adaptation of educational systems as per the intended learners through intensive learning analytics. But was the learner really a part of the adaptation process taking place? Learning analytics are usually designed to the course's adaptation and solely for the teachers. Thus, learning analytics in gamified adaptive educational systems involving the course, teachers and learners together are still under investigation. In this study, the Personalized Adaptive Gamified E-learning (PAGE) model is introduced to extend MOOCs by providing new satisfactory levels of learning analytics and visualization in the rich e-learning process that supports the learner's intervention in the resultant learning analytics. The proposed Learning analytics have been developed to make the necessary adaptation to the course and learner's learning flow, as well as visualizing the process and adaptation decisions to the learners. Results show a positive potential towards learning adaptation and visualization, and a necessity to provide an additional focus for the gamification concept.";"21693536";0;"USA";"Web of Science"

Background Mobile devices and applications, which have become an integral part of our lives, are used for different purposes, including educational objectives. Among others, they are used in the process of foreign language acquisition. The use of a MALL application to learn foreign languages has advantages and drawbacks, which are important to understand, in order to achieve better learning results, while improving the enjoyment of the process. Methodology The study population included people who participated in a foreign language course and used Duolingo application on a mobile device in parallel. One group consisted of high school pupils, who were obliged to use the application and filled in before and after questionnaires. The other group consisted of people who took face-to-face courses, and chose to use the same Duolingo application voluntarily, in order to assist their studies. The second group answered another questionnaire tailored to more experienced users. The findings were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 22, and a model was examined with Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. Contribution This paper helps to understand the perceived advantages and drawbacks of using a MALL application by students both in mandatory and voluntary environments. Findings Most of the participants found the MALL Duolingo application enhanced the learning process. The gamification characteristics, ease of use, ubiquity and self-learning facilities had a stimulating effect on the process of learning, and contributed to the willingness to continue using the application and to recommend it to others. However, some statistically significant differences were found between the groups, referring to the characteristics of the application, among them ubiquity, lack of human feedback and simplicity of use. Recommendations for Practitioners The research findings can contribute to both teachers and students who conduct and participate in foreign language courses, by helping them examine the possibility of combining mobile learning with a traditional face-to-face course. Moreover, the findings can assist developers of mobile learning applications, in order to include gamification options in the process of learning. Recommendation for Researchers Researchers in the fields of mobile applications and m-learning need to understand the factors enhancing the learning process, in order to develop the next generations of m-learning applications. Impact on Society Mobile devices have become an accessory that almost every person in the world uses. Its ubiquitous characteristics allow using it everywhere and anytime.

Our ability to live within the planet's biological limits requires not only a major rethink in how we produce and distribute 'things', but also a shift in consumption activities. Footprint calculators can provide a framing that communicates the extent to which an individual's daily activities are compatible with our One Planet context. This paper presents the findings from the first international study to assess the value of personal Footprint calculators in guiding individuals towards sustainable consumption choices. It focuses specifically on Global Footprint Network's personal Footprint calculator, and aims to understand the profile of calculator users and assess the contribution of calculators to increasing individual awareness and encouraging sustainable choices. Our survey of 4245 respondents show that 75% of users resided in 10 countries, 54% were aged 18-34 years and had largely used the calculator within an educational context (62%). The calculator was considered a valuable tool for knowledge generation by 91% of users, and 78% found it useful to motivate action. However, only 23% indicated the calculator provided them with the necessary information to make actual changes to their life and reduce their personal Footprint. The paper discusses how and why this personal Footprint calculator has been effective in enhancing individuals' understanding of the environmental impact of their actions, framing the scale of the problem and empowering users to understand the impacts of different lifestyle choices. Those individual-level and system-level changes needed to generate global sustainability outcomes are also discussed. Similar to other calculators, a gap is also identified in terms of this calculator facilitating individuals to convert new knowledge into action.";"17489326";4;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

In fact, across disciplines and contexts, the amplification of 21st century learning has been giving gamification a special place in education. There are numerous studies conducted on the use of gamification among school children, university students or even trainee teachers. Coincidentally, all of these studies have shown that gamification does impact their learning. Hence, as harmless as it seems, any teachers who are not equipped with such knowledge on the benefits of gamification may hinder their learners and themselves from reaching their utmost teaching and learning experience especially when it comes to grammar learning among the younger pupils. Considering this thought in mind, this research was conducted to prove that the use of Kahoot! helps the Year 3 pupils in retaining the English Irregular verbs. This quasi experimental designed research gathered data from a sample of 35 Year 3 pupils using the pre-test and post-test results. The findings which were analysed descriptively using sample t-test showed that pupils' performances in the post-test improved over the use of Kahoot! in classroom. In conclusion, this research provides an insight on number of ways that gamification can actually impacted the pupils' learning; especially in terms of memory retention. It also works as a stepping stone for more researches to study on the effectiveness of using Kahoot! in tackling any part of learning especially among the younger learners.";"22299327";2;"Malaysia";"Web of Science"

In the context of virtual education, a question that remains to be solved is associated with the level of motivation possessed by the students during the course. Usually, at the School of Engineering in the University of Medellin, this issue is tackled through activities such as chats and forums. Mostly, these activities are not enough to motivate the student in the activities related with the learning process. This work proposes two motivation strategies based on gamification and constructivism. These strategies are validated in a course called programming fundamentals, taught to all bachelor degrees given in the School of Engineering. Results obtained through the experiments suggest that proposed strategies improve the student's performance and satisfaction in the course. Therefore, when teaching at the virtual scenario, using Information and Communication Technologies in the educational environment is not only the way to contact the student, it is the mean to develop pedagogical-didactic approaches that finally enrich the educational process and consequently motivate the student to perform well.";"15480992";5;"USA";"Web of Science"

Faced with persistent physical symptoms and debilitating social consequences, patients follow complex treatment regimens and often have difficulty adhering to them. Purpose: In this manuscript, we review factors which contribute to low adherence rates and advance potential single- and multi-factor-based interventions. It is hoped that these observations can lead to improvements in managed care of this vulnerable population of patients. Methods: A narrative review of the primary literature was performed on contributing factors with primary focus on the period 2015-2020 using available databases and search engines. Adherence pain points identified were mapped against a series of potential solutions which are presented. Results: Enhancement of treatment adherence relies on two approaches viz. single-factor and multi-factor solutions. Single factors identified include electronic reminders, enhanced health education, financial incentives, gamification strategies, community drivers, persona-based modeling, and burden relief of poly pharmacy. Multi-factor solutions combine two or more of the seven approaches offering the potential for flexible interventions tailored to the individual. Discussion and Conclusion: Heart failure patients with poor adherence have increased mortality, hospitalization needs, and healthcare costs. This review highlights current single-factor and multi-factor adherence methods. Against a backdrop of diversity of approaches, multi-factor solutions cast the widest net for positively influencing adherent behaviors. A key enabler lies in the development and leveraging of patient personas in the synthesis of successful intervention methods. Deployable solutions can also be envisioned in clinical trials where adherence tracking represents an essential component.";"1177889X";0;"New Zealand";"Web of Science"

An algorithm for the generation of tests with different levels of complexity using multi-criteria optimization is proposed. It is important to note that all test items could be considered as an element of a level in an educational game or gamified environment, and their weight influences the complexity of the game. The results show that the proposed model allows the generation of tests not only with different levels of complexity, but it also provides additional flexibility in respect of the selected number of questions and their weight.

While traditional face-to-face interaction is still the norm, mobile, online and virtual augmentations are increasingly adopted worldwide. Moreover, with the advent of gaming technology besides the 3D visual paradigm, the touch and feel paradigm is slowly taking its place in the user interface design through gamification. While haptic (force feedback) devices were barely available a decade ago outside research laboratories, the rapid rise in gaming technology has driven the cost significantly lower enabling the spread of these devices in many households and the wide public. This article presents a novel haptic-based training tool implemented as a gaming scenario to assist students in learning of abstract concepts in Physics. The focus is on electromagnetism as one of the fundamental forces in nature and specifically the abstractions used as building blocks around the Lorentz force. Experimental results suggest that by introducing well designed visual-haptic interfaces in presenting abstract concepts, students become better engaged in the classrooms and superior learning outcomes can be achieved.";"17837677";1;"UNITED STATES";"Web of Science"

The design and development of socio-educational and community projects in music training centres are tasks which, in using music as a tool towards mediation, can contribute to alleviate social dysfunctions in the nearby surroundings as well as to create social cohesion and feelings of community belonging and identity. Nevertheless, there is some inertia in the way things are done and a perpetuation of traditional models of education in music where there is no room for innovative projects with authentic social engagement. This paper will analyse the challenges and contexts that music schools face in the 21st Century at a social and community level, and how to address them with new educational models. The social commitment and engagement of music training institutions should spark a change in the design of activities through innovation as well as opening new avenues for collaboration with other social and institutional community actors.

This practice marks a shift in the journalistic norms, positioning journalism and news users within the neoliberal paradigm. In this view, the study proposes a discursive approach to examine how gamified news discourse is colonized by the neoliberal values of marketization and commodification. The analysis takes a case study of Pirate Fishing: An Interactive Investigation, a gamified news launched by Al Jazeera. It is not just the narrative of Pirate that carries ideological bearings, rather the ludic design itself is found to be fit within the neoliberal mentality. Therefore, the ludic semiosis of Pirate Fishing is examined as well.

With that in mind, we created a staff development session that involved a playful learning activity, in which attendees experienced 90's nostalgia, whilst working on an important learning and teaching issue. Based on the British game show, The Crystal Maze, The 'Crys-TEL' maze required attendees to complete a number of challenges as a group to attempt to 'solve' a pressing learning and teaching issue. Using gamification techniques, defined as game design elements in non-game settings, attendees experienced different delivery styles, whilst always working towards the learning and teaching issue they had been asked to consider. In a nod to the original Crystal Maze game show, attendees worked in groups to score points for completing various tasks. The two groups with the most points competed against each other in the final to collect crystals, and ultimately conquer the 'maze'.

Utilities, government, and commercial entities offer numerous programs and consumer products to help individuals set or reach goals related to energy use. Many of these interventions and products have related apps that use gamification in some capacity in order to improve the user experience, offer motivation, and encourage behavior change. We identified 57 apps from nearly 2400 screened apps that both target direct energy use and employ at least one element of gamification. We evaluated these apps with specific focus on gamification components, game elements, and behavioral constructs. Our analysis shows that the average energy related app heavily underutilizes search engine optimization, gamification components, and game design elements, as well as the behavioral constructs known to impact energy-related decision-making and behavior.

Therefore, the online platform KOLEGEA, presented here, aims to support postgraduate training in general practice (PT in GP) in Germany through virtual interaction. Methodology: In 2012, the interdisciplinary research project KOLEGEA set up an online platform that any physicians in PT in GP can use for free after registration with their unitary continuous education number (Einheitliche Fortbildungsnummer, EFN). It offers problem-based learning and allows to discuss self-published anonymized patient cases with the community that can be classified and discussed with experienced mentors (specialists in general practice - GPs) in small virtual groups. Results: An anonymous online survey carried out as part of the 2014 project evaluation showed a good acceptance of the platform, even though shortage of time was mentioned as a limiting factor for its use. Data analysis showed that KOLEGEA was used by PPT in GP in all federal states. Patterns of passive use were predominant (90%). This report also describes the further development of the platform (in 2015 and 2016) that integrates an activity monitor as part of a gamification concept. Conclusions: Due to a low response rate of the 2014 online survey and the preliminary evaluations of usage patterns we could identify only initial trends regarding the role of KOLEGEA in supporting PPT.

However, the automatic generation of these tasks can be unfeasible due to the high-order search space for the possible combinations of tasks; this complexity increases when considering the possible constraints as well as adapting the tasks to the individual characteristics of each student. This paper presents a new method to automatically generate teaching matching-to-sample tasks, adapting the difficulty by using bio-inspired optimization metaheuristics. Genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, and integer and categorical particle swarm optimization were evaluated to determine their stability and capacity to generate adapted tasks. A comparison of the results between the algorithms showed a better rate of convergence for the genetic algorithms, which were able to generate tasks at an adapted level of difficulty to students.

At the same time, the complex interplay of attack techniques and possible countermeasures makes it difficult to appropriately plan, implement, and evaluate an organization's defense. More often than not, the worlds of technical threats and organizational controls remain disjunct. In this article, we introduce PenQuest, a meta model designed to present a complete view on information system attacks and their mitigation while providing a tool for both semantic data enrichment and security education. PenQuest simulates time-enabled attacker/defender behavior as part of a dynamic, imperfect information multi-player game that derives significant parts of its ruleset from established information security sources such as STIX, CAPEC, CVE/CWE and NIST SP 800-53. Attack patterns, vulnerabilities, and mitigating controls are mapped to counterpart strategies and concrete actions through practical, data-centric mechanisms. The gamified model considers and defines a wide range of actors, assets, and actions, thereby enabling the assessment of cyber risks while giving technical experts the opportunity to explore specific attack scenarios in the context of an abstracted IT infrastructure. We implemented PenQuest as a physical serious game prototype and successfully tested it in a higher education environment.

This study introduces perceived instructor presence as a way to promote such interactions and investigates its effects on student learning experience in online learning. Background Drawing upon theories of constructivism and social presence, this study proposes a research model to explore the causal relationships from the interactivity of a communication tool to the perception of instructor presence and to student learning experiences such as engagement and satisfaction. Methodology The survey method was used to collect data from online business classes where an interactive communication tool was required to use for class communication and collaboration. Partial Least Squares analysis was used as the primary data analysis tool. Contribution This study introduces perceived instructor presence in the online learning context and empirically tests its effects on the online learning experience. This study also contributes to the online learning literature by confirming the constructivist's point of view on learning that interactions lead to better learning experiences, in the online learning environment. Findings The study results show that the use of an interactive communication tool in online learning fosters strong student-instructor interactions and promotes students' perceptions of instructor presence, which eventually enhances student engagement and satisfaction in online classes. Recommendations for Practitioners This study recommends practitioners (e.g., teachers and professors) to use more interactive communication tools such as Microsoft Teams and Slack to promote the instructor presence in their online classes, which ultimately increase student engagement and satisfaction. Practitioners are also recommended to develop and use any other teaching methods or activities that can increase perceived instructor presence, which has a direct impact on student engagement in online learning. Recommendations for Researchers While the fellow researchers can take one of the future research directions in this paper, it is recommended to consider more fundamental approaches to the study of online learning. For example, the concept of presence is a radical difference when courses are moved from face-to-face to online learning. Future research could investigate how various types of presence can play differently in online learning. Impact on Society Better learning experiences are likely to have a significant impact on society's well-being, and the findings of this study suggest how student learning experiences can be improved in online classes. Furthermore, this is particularly useful when many face-to-face classes were forced to switch to online classes abruptly during the COVID-19 pandemic as many students, parents, and educators were concerned with online learning experiences. Future Research A replication study with different communication tools in various courses would be good future research to support the generalizability of the findings. Another interesting future research is to employ other types of dependent variables, such as tool adoption and academic performance. It would be worth investigating how different types of learning experiences can be associated with various learning tools. As this study finds that an interactive communication tool is associated with student engagement, gamification can be associated with student enjoyment in online learning.";"15479714";1;"USA";"Web of Science"

However, in Colombia, according to the results of the Saber tests, the development of these competencies is still deficient, and the problem is especially acute in virtual education, since students lose their motivation to learn more easily. A gamma tool that allows increasing such motivational levels while teaching about citizenship competencies is a solution proposed by a team of Colombian researchers. This paper presents a prioritization exercise that allowed the project team to select, using a formal prioritization method, those priority competencies to be gammatized. The method used involved the design of data collection instruments, consultation with experts using the Delphi method, conducting focus groups, calculating results by quartiles and validating and contrasting final results. The results indicate that, in this particular context of gamification and virtual education, the communicative type of citizen competencies, specifically the writing competencies, together with the cognitive type of citizen competencies are the most relevant.";"19097433";0;"Colombia";"Web of Science"

PPM instructors have been largely unable to transform what is being taught into applicable skills. Gamification has been successfully applied in some educational environments and it has been increasingly applied in Management university courses. The objective of this study is to propose and assess a gamified strategy for teaching Project Portfolio Management to MBA students. The implementation of this gamified experience was carried out in 2018, 2019 and 2020 with 122 students. They were quite satisfied with the gamified experience and recognized that the Portfolio Game Experience contributed to learning different PPM techniques and processes, especially those associated with project prioritization and selection. Moreover, 100% of the respondents would recommend the course to a colleague. By qualitatively analyzing students' feedback, this study has found out that the Portfolio Game Experience provided the students the practical experience of actively learning what they have seen in theory. Students also highlighted typical game characteristics that contribute to their learning, like the fact that the game is fun, challenging, motivating and interactive.

The Project System does not give fast and easy answers but leads participants to find them on their own. For 30 hours, participants find themselves within a larp, which is a very intense type of role-playing game based on human interactions. The author has chosen a larp as a medium as one of the most immersive and influential method of game-based learning which can facilitate topics that are normally hard to explain through conventional methods of learning. Participants learn firsthand through their roles, emotions, story and experience. Findings - Project System was a really strong and important experience for many players that may have partially changed their lives. After more than 500 players walked through it, the author can say that this method is beneficial. Originality/value - Larp as an educational tool is used all over the world; however, there are still only few professional organizations.

Since these algorithms are complex, there is a need for a system which would enable their application both in everyday work and education processes. This paper describes a software system for learning AI algorithms called SAIL (Software System for AI Learning), which can be used both on computers and mobile devices. The paper gives examples of lab exercises and self-study tasks that through graphic representation and detailed procedures help students master this area. Students can enter their examples into the system and obtain correct solutions for those examples. At any point when an example is simulated, a student can proceed to the next step or go back to the previous one, save the current simulation as a file, or print the detailed procedure as a task solution. SAIL helps lecturers go through the syllabus more efficiently and improve class material, while at the same time it helps students get a better grasp of implemented algorithms. SAIL can also benefit software engineers, who can select and simulate an adequate algorithm to solve a specific problem. The results of the SAIL system are verified within the AI introductory course at the School of Electrical Engineering University of Belgrade and they are presented in this paper.";"10613773";1;"USA";"Web of Science"

As a consequence of this, STEM emerges (Science, Technology, Engineering & Maths) (Stohlmann, Moore y Roehrig, 2012) to promotes integrated learning. Looking for academic excellence through methodologies that motivate students, gamification has characteristics to be considered as an important element in order to improve teaching-learning process.

One novel approach is to train parents to use evidence-based interventions for their child with ASD via telehealth. Pilot work examining the efficacy of one such program, ImPACT Online, demonstrated a high rate of parent program engagement, low attrition, and associated gains in parent learning and child social communication. Objective: The objective of this study was to conduct an open trial of ImPACT Online to better understand its dissemination potential. Methods: We examined the reach and representativeness of families who registered (n=36) compared to families who were referred (n=139) to the open trial for one referral site. We then compared the demographics of all families who enrolled in the open trial (n=112) to families who enrolled in one of two controlled trials of the same program (n=50). We also examined metrics of program engagement for the open and controlled trials, the relationship between program engagement and changes in parents' intervention knowledge, and program evaluation for the participants in the open trial. Results: In total, 25.8% (36/139) of the parents who were given information about the program at their child's diagnostic feedback session registered with the program. The parents who enrolled in the open (OT) and controlled trials (CT), respectively, were similar in gender (OT: 84.8% (95/112); CT: 88% (44/50), female), marital status (OT: 80.4% (90/112); CT: 69.6% (32/46), married), education (OT: 58.0% (65/112); CT: 54.0% (27/50), college degree or higher), and employment status (OT: 58.0% (65/112); CT: 65.3% (32/49), employed outside the home). The child participants were similar in terms of gender (OT: 83.0% (93/112); CT: 76.0% (38/50), male) and race and ethnicity (OT: 38.4% (43/112); CT: 24.0% (12/50), minority). However, the mean chronological age of the child participants in the open trial group was significantly higher (Mean=60.0 months) than in the controlled trial group (Mean=43.0 months), with t(160)=5.22, P<.001. Parents in the open trial engaged with the program at a significantly lower rate than the controlled trial, F-3,F-81=21.14, P<.001. Program engagement was significantly associated with gains in parent intervention knowledge across both the groups, beta=.41, t=2.43, P=.02. Participants in the open access trial evaluated the program highly, but several barriers were noted. Conclusions: These data suggest that additional strategies may need to be developed to support families in using telehealth-based parent-mediated intervention in community settings.";"14388871";18;"Canada";"Web of Science"

Applied games including serious games (in brief, computerized games for serious purposes) and gamification (gaming elements used outside of games) have the potential to increase the impact of mental health internet interventions via three processes. First, by extending the reach of online programs to those who might not otherwise use them. Second, by improving engagement through both game-based and serious motivational dynamics. Third, by utilizing varied mechanisms for change, including therapeutic processes and gaming features. In this scoping review, we aim to advance the field by exploring the potential and opportunities available in this area. We review engagement factors which may be exploited and demonstrate that there is promising evidence of effectiveness for serious games for depression from contemporary systematic reviews. We illustrate six major categories of tested applied games for mental health (exergames, virtual reality, cognitive behavior therapy-based games, entertainment games, biofeedback, and cognitive training games) and demonstrate that it is feasible to translate traditional evidence-based interventions into computer gaming formats and to exploit features of computer games for therapeutic change. Applied games have considerable potential for increasing the impact of online interventions for mental health. However, there are few independent trials, and direct comparisons of game-based and non-game-based interventions are lacking. Further research, faster iterations, rapid testing, non-traditional collaborations, and user-centered approaches are needed to respond to diverse user needs and preferences in rapidly changing environments.";"16640640";67;"USA";"Web of Science"

Serious gaming and gamification education have the potential to provide a quality, cost-effective, novel approach that is flexible, portable, and enjoyable and allow interaction with tutors and peers. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of serious gaming/gamification for health professions education compared with traditional learning, other types of digital education, or other serious gaming/gamification interventions in terms of patient outcomes, knowledge, skills, professional attitudes, and satisfaction (primary outcomes) as well as economic outcomes of education and adverse events (secondary outcomes). Methods: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, Educational Resources Information Centre, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature was conducted from 1990 to August 2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently searched, screened, and assessed the study quality and extracted data. A meta-analysis was not deemed appropriate due to the heterogeneity of populations, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes. Therefore, a narrative synthesis is presented. Results: A total of 27 RCTs and 3 cluster RCTs with 3634 participants were included. Two studies evaluated gamification interventions, and the remaining evaluated serious gaming interventions. One study reported a small statistically significant difference between serious gaming and digital education of primary care physicians in the time to control blood pressure in a subgroup of their patients already taking antihypertensive medications. There was evidence of a moderate-to-large magnitude of effect from five studies evaluating individually delivered interventions for objectively measured knowledge compared with traditional learning. There was also evidence of a small-to-large magnitude of effect from 10 studies for improved skills compared with traditional learning. Two and four studies suggested equivalence between interventions and controls for knowledge and skills, respectively. Evidence suggested that serious gaming was at least as effective as other digital education modalities for these outcomes. There was insufficient evidence to conclude whether one type of serious gaming/gamification intervention is more effective than any other. There was limited evidence for the effects of serious gaming/gamification on professional attitudes. Serious gaming/gamification may improve satisfaction, but the evidence was limited. Evidence was of low or very low quality for all outcomes. Quality of evidence was downgraded due to the imprecision, inconsistency, and limitations of the study. Conclusions: Serious gaming/gamification appears to be at least as effective as controls, and in many studies, more effective for improving knowledge, skills, and satisfaction. However, the available evidence is mostly of low quality and calls for further rigorous, theory-driven research.";"14388871";62;"Canada";"Web of Science"

It has become a novel way of interaction among people and influences people's social lives and public opinion as well as people's purchasing decisions and businesses. Any website or platform that allows social interaction is considered to be a social media site. Social media use among children in 25 European countries has been reported to be 38% among 9-12 year olds and 77% among those aged 13-16 years. All these children report having their own profile on at least one social network site. While social networking provides children and adolescents with many opportunities and benefits, it also carries many risks. Among the benefits are socialization and communication enhancement, improving learning skills, positive impact on education and getting health information. Potential risks of social media use include falsifying age and identity, cyberbullying, sexting, Facebook depression, gamification, glamourization, cyberostracism and sleep disturbances. Conclusion: Paediatricians play a vital role in promoting the physical, mental and social welfare of all children. There is a critical need for paediatricians to play an active role, guiding children and families appropriately through the impact of social networking, in order to become a real driver of children's development.";"03406199";1;"USA";"Web of Science"

Several question banks are available for ABSITE preparation. However, ABSITE Quest (AQ) utilizes a method called spaced education which has been demonstrated to help with retaining information longer and improve exam performance. This study hypothesizes that using this method will help residents improve their ABSITE performance. DESIGN: Retrospective survey data was collected from residents who participated in AQ, including postgraduate year (PGY) level, as well as 2019 and 2020 ABSITE percentiles. AQ user data was used to match respondent's total number of questions completed and daily engagement level to the survey data. Paired, single-tailed student's t test was used to evaluate the significance of ABSITE percentile change between 2019 and 2020 among AQ users. SETTING: ChristianaCare, Newark, DE, United States. Nonclinical. PARTICIPANTS: All ABSITE Quest users were surveyed (n = 390), of which 104 responded. 21 responses were from PGY1 residents and were excluded, resulting in a total of 83 responses. RESULTS: The mean percentile difference of AQ users from 2019 to 2020 was +15.8 (p < 0.00001). When categorizing by the total number of questions completed, high users demonstrated a mean percentile difference of +15.3 (p = 0.00002), average users had a difference of +19.1 (p = 0.00029), and low users showed a percentile difference of +1.2 (p = 0.45244). When categorizing by daily engagement level, high users demonstrated a mean percentile difference of +17.9 (p < 0.00001), low users had a mean percentile difference of +15.3 (p = 0.00124), and minimal users showed a mean percentile change of -5.7. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the spaced education method with ABSITE Quest, especially in users with a greater number of questions completed and high levels of daily engagement, correlated with a significant improvement on ABSITE performance.

National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds competitive, investigator-initiated grant applications. Funded grants represent the state of the science and therefore are expected to anticipate the progression of research in the near future. Objective: The objective of this paper is to provide an analysis of the kinds of smartphone-based intervention apps funded in NIH research grants during the five-year period between 2014 and 2018. Methods: We queried NIH Reporter to identify candidate funded grants that addressed mHealth and the use of smartphones. From 1524 potential grants, we identified 397 that met the requisites of including an intervention app. Each grant's abstract was analyzed to understand the focus of intervention. Year of funding, type of activity (eg, R01, R34, and so on) and funding were noted. Results: We identified 13 categories of strategies employed in funded smartphone intervention apps. Most grants included either one (35.0%) or two (39.0%) intervention approaches. These included artificial intelligence (57 apps), bionic adaptation (33 apps), cognitive and behavioral therapies (68 apps), contingency management (24 apps), education and information (85 apps), enhanced motivation (50 apps), facilitating, reminding and referring (60 apps), gaming and gamification (52 apps), mindfulness training (18 apps), monitoring and feedback (192 apps), norm setting (7 apps), skills training (85 apps) and social support and social networking (59 apps). The most frequently observed grant types included Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) grants (40.8%) and Research Project Grants (R01) s (26.2%). The number of grants funded increased through the five-year period from 60 in 2014 to 112 in 2018. Conclusions: Smartphone intervention apps are increasingly competitive for NIH funding.

We assess the gamification method of splitting and combining (SC) to encourage students to finish the process of learning structured knowledge in the university. The results show that this method works well in promoting learning enjoyment and that splitting demonstrates better performance than combining.

During the gameplay session, various game mechanisms trigger individual, social, and collective learning outcomes of the players, which in the end can lead to a change in the individual belief system towards the subject. Despite demonstrating its applicability in other complex domains, such as maritime spatial planning or urban development, an investigation into the applicability of serious games within the tourism domain is scarce. In conceiving the process of tourism planning as a strategic plan with dependent actors, resources, objectives, and challenges in a multi-layered decision-making process, creating or re-creating such strategic games can be beneficial to promote the understanding and change of belief systems among stakeholders. A particularly critically question is how serious gaming is able to generate qualitative research inquiries in order to shed more light on the complexities of the tourism destination planning process. Destination planning research can profit from new disruptive methods, such as serious gaming, for a more experimental and explorative approach in understanding the interconnectedness of tourism stakeholders, as well as estimations of short and long-term impact of decisions on a destination. By enabling strategic conversation about tourism planning issues, serious gaming functions as a strategic learning tool that provides opportunities for individual and community learning.

The available data of German medical faculties indicate that digital teaching concepts currently play a subordinate role in medicine in general and specifically in otorhinolaryngology. By assessing data of our own institution, we could demonstrate that the majority of medical students refer mainly to material handed out by the lecturers as single source of information for learning Otorhinolaryngology. Therefore, the application of sound digital teaching strategies provides special chances, in particular in otorhinolaryngology to cope with the excessive amount of online information from partly unclear sources. Currently, the possible degree of digital teaching reaches from digital service supply via punctual provision of classic teaching concepts and blended learning up to completely digital curricula. The attractiveness of curricular integration of digital teaching strategies is less based on the utilization of merely technological progress, but rather on the variety of applying innovative curricula and new didactic concepts. Depending on the intended teaching purpose, the flipped classroom and the virtual reality seem to have a particularly high potential, while mobile learning is already established in individual practice. Testing and evaluating digital teaching innovations for concrete scenarios currently belongs to the most important scientific challenges of digital teaching concepts. Today, the nationwide implementation of digital teaching in Germany is less impeded by technical conditions, but by missing financing because sponsoring is currently mainly performed with reference to concrete projects; in the context of permanent implementation, however, regular costs arise.

A quantitative study was done within the framework of a design-based research. Eighty-one (81) students participated in the research, all from the Differential Calculus course. Twelve (12) didactic units were designed. The instrument used was the Synthesized Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (SIMMS), adapted to record the categories of Attention, Relevance, Confidence and Satisfaction (Keller's motivational model). A significant contribution of the pedagogical strategy and the different categories of motivation was verified, whereas the significance between collaboration and motivation was also evident (intervention 2). Finally, the strategy can provide preliminary evidences in reducing dropout.

However, in technological areas such as engineering, where students must carry out hands-on exercises and laboratory work essential for their learning, it is not so easy to design online environments for practicals. The aim of this experimental study was to examine students' acceptance of technology and the process of adopting an online learning environment incorporating web-based resources, such as virtual laboratories, interactive activities, and educational videos, and a game-based learning methodology. To this end, their responses to an online questionnaire (n = 223) were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The study was based on the technology acceptance model (TAM), but included and assessed other factors such as perceived efficiency, playfulness, and satisfaction, which are not explained by the TAM. Our results confirm that this extension of the TAM provides a useful theoretical model to help understand and explain users' acceptance of an online learning environment incorporating virtual laboratory and practical work. Our results also indicate that efficiency, playfulness, and students' degree of satisfaction are factors that positively influence the original TAM variables and students' acceptance of this technology. Here, we also discuss the significant theoretical and spractical implications for educational use of these web-based resources.";"03601315";29;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

Therefore, this study explored the gamification in higher educational courses by collecting surveys and discusses the factors influencing the acceptance of gamification in higher education. Based on the PLS-SEM results, students should take initial game-based learning content to be more familiar with gamification; furthermore, they could have a positive experience so that they would increase their intention. Performance expectancy is the most important factors influencing a student to accept gamification. Other factors, such as effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, involvement, skill, and control, are also important factors.

Nevertheless, previous research is taking for granted that students have a positive attitude towards EVGs and did not ensure a proper understanding of students' characteristics that might influence their attitude towards them. Therefore, this study's main goal is to explore four students' characteristics (perceived relevance, perceived confidence, media affinity, and perceived self-efficacy) that influence students' attitude towards the use of EVGs to develop competencies. Using the fsQCA method to analyze data gathered on a sample of 128 undergraduate students we delve into different configurations underlying students' positive and negative attitude towards the use of EVGs. Main results suggest three configurations leading to a positive attitude with perceived, relevance being a necessary and sufficient condition for students' positive attitude towards the use of EVGs to develop their competencies. Four configurations were found to condition a negative attitude suggesting that equifinality can be considered when explaining students' attitude towards the use of EVGs to develop competencies.

This study employed a mixed-method research approach, using three formative assessments or a post-test only design to examine students' learning achievement. Questionnaires and personal interviews were employed to support the data collection process in terms of students' perceived motivation. Fifty-six students were the respondents involved in a non-randomized experiment with a control group design. The results reveal that assessment 1 showed no significant difference between the two groups of the gamified flipped and non-gamified flipped classroom instruction (t = 1.68, p.474), while assessment 2 and 3 were significantly different (t = 5.54, p = .007 < .05) and (t = 10.17, p = .001 < .05). In the present study, the findings confirm that the students were positive regarding perceived competence, autonomy, and relatedness, better performance, and were able to achieve good achievement during the tests. The survey results reveal that the gamified flip-class setting fostered better motivation and engagement. Particularly, students motivated to compete and beat other students during the gamification activities by collecting points and badges as many as possible. Four main themes emerged from the qualitative interviews, namely, (1) pre-class learning motivation, (2) pre-class competition, (3) students' learning autonomy, and (4) students' social engagement. Conclusions from this study showed that the gamified flip-class setting had successfully constructed the basic psychological needs of SDT, namely: competency, autonomy, and relatedness.";"03601315";43;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

Today, with the advances in web-based learning technologies, a hybrid teaching methodology has become widespread: blended learning. It is a term used to describe the way e-learning is being combined with traditional classroom methods and independent study. Educators design online materials and utilize them in synchronous or asynchronous ways to suit the convenience of learners and instructors and program demands. In this study with a group of intermediate-level English language learners at the School of Foreign Languages of an English-medium state university, the goal was to enhance students' vocabulary learning performance by using synchronous and asynchronous games and activities that will activate and maintain intrinsic motivation in an effort to teach parts of speech and collocations over a period of eight weeks.

Interventions that promote healthy sleep, such as those that focus on the dissemination of behavioral and environmental recommendations of sleep hygiene with children, are presented as an alternative. Serious game design offers wide- reaching domains in health applications and is increasing in popularity, particularly with children and teens because of it's potential to engage and motivate players differently from other interventions. This study aims to evaluate effects of serious game on sleep hygiene recommendations Perfect Bedroom: learn to sleep well, on sleep habits and sleep parameters of healthy children. This is an experimental, prospective and quantitative study. We will randomize children in experimental (n = 88) and no intervention groups (n = 88). The experiment has four stages (pre-intervention, intervention, post- intervention, and follow-up), which will count with participation of children and their parents/guardians. In the evaluation stages, the guardians will answer questionnaires and scales to assess sociodemographic and health data, sleep habits and sleep pattern of their child. The children themselves will answer the following: a scale to assess sleepiness levels, a questionnaire to evaluate the serious game and the game itself, will characterize their bedroom and the activities they perform before sleep, with strategies developed by researches. Intervention with experimental group conducted with the serious game Perfect Bedroom will happen twice a week, for 3 weeks in a row, resulting in six sessions of 50 min each. Inferential analysis will be conducted for comparisons between groups and intragroups to measure effect of intervention in primary outcomes (sleep habits) and secondary outcomes (sleep parameters). We expect that the intervention with this game can provide valuable evidence to a new approach in promoting healthy sleep habits, with applications in clinical, educational, and familiar settings, which could diminish future health issues and risk at psychiatric diseases, decreasing the social burden of treatments for these conditions in children.";"16641078";2;"USA";"Web of Science"

MS-related symptoms impact negatively on the quality of life of persons with MS, who need to be active in the management of their health. mHealth apps could support these patient groups by offering useful tools, providing reliable information, and monitoring symptoms. A previous study from this group identified needs, barriers, and facilitators for the use of mHealth solutions among persons with MS. It is unknown how commercially available health apps meet these needs. Objective: The main objective of this review was to assess how the features present in MS apps meet the reported needs of persons with MS. Methods: We followed a combination of scoping review methodology and systematic assessment of features and content of mHealth apps. A search strategy was defined for the two most popular app stores (Google Play and Apple App Store) to identify relevant apps. Reviewers independently conducted a screening process to filter apps according to the selection criteria. Interrater reliability was assessed through the Fleiss-Cohen coefficient (k=.885). Data from the included MS apps were extracted and explored according to classification criteria. Results: An initial total of 581 potentially relevant apps was found. After removing duplicates and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 30 unique apps were included in the study. A similar number of apps was found in both stores. The majority of the apps dealt with disease management and disease and treatment information. Most apps were developed by small and medium-sized enterprises, followed by pharmaceutical companies. Patient education and personal data management were among the most frequently included features in these apps. Energy management and remote monitoring were often not present in MS apps. Very few contained gamification elements. Conclusions: Currently available MS apps fail to meet the needs and demands of persons with MS. There is a need for health professionals, researchers, and industry partners to collaborate in the design of mHealth solutions for persons with MS to increase adoption and engagement.";"22915222";17;"Canada";"Web of Science"

This knowledge is tested annually with the American Board for Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) exam and is used to evaluate several aspects of a resident. We hypothesized that using a jeopardy game in educational conference would encourage residents to engage in self-learning and improve ABSITE scores at a single institution. Materials and methods: At a single institution, during protected education conference, residents played an hour-long surgical jeopardy game every 7 wk to summarize high yield topics discussed during the previous 6 wk of didactic learning. A 5-point Likert survey was completed by general surgery residents to discern the utility of the game format for learning. The ABSITE category scores were also evaluated from the year before and the year after the game was implemented. Results: Twenty-four general surgery residents took the survey with >80% agreeing that the jeopardy format was either a fun or an effective way to learn general surgery topics. Additionally, over 80% of residents thought the game format helped with retention of knowledge. ABSITE categories that had a jeopardy session improved from 65.9% to 70.4% correct (P = 0.0003). ABSITE categories that did not have dedicated jeopardy had a nonsignificant increase in scores (67.7%-69.9%, P = 0.1). Conclusions: Implementing surgical jeopardy as a component of educational conferences in general surgery resident training is correlated with improvement of ABSITE scores. Surgical jeopardy may be easily adopted and implemented to stimulate self-directed learning for residents. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.";"00224804";0;"USA";"Web of Science"

The adoption of gamification in information systems (IS) education is promising for engaging and motivating students to complete their degree programs. Call for research in this area is particularly on the increase in the IS field. Accordingly, we need to organize the aggregation of research in this area and use common terminologies to promote progressive research practice in the field. In this paper, we use a multi-method approach to systematically review existing research on gamification in IS education to identify common terminologies, identify trends in topics studied, highlight understudied areas, and, thus, present opportunities for future research. The multi-method approach combines classical systematic review method and social network analysis to provide additional insight into the knowledge structure of researchers involved in the gamification of IS education.

This paper suggests possible extensions of game design use for each stage of the participatory modeling process, aiming at better learning, communication among stakeholders, and overall engagement. The proposed extensions are based on the effects that different types of game-like applications bring to the aspects of social learning and the contribution of gamification to engagement, motivation, and enjoyment of some activities.

This paper provides the findings of the survey conducted among 124 teachers employed at three primary and two secondary schools in Croatia about the usage of gamification as well as attitudes towards gamification in general. The research results give insights into the profiles of the teachers who use or do not use gamification during their classes, and identify gamification mechanics and applications they employ. Teachers' opinions about the gamification and the reasons for (not) introducing it into the class are also presented. According to the research results, it is possible to conclude that less than half of the respondents were familiar with the concept of gamification and that they applied it in their work. The research results show that most of the teachers got acknowledged with the concept of gamification on a personal initiative. Points, quests and storylines are the mechanics of gamification that the respondents most often applied in their work. Courses in which respondents the most frequently applied gamification were the mathematics, Croatian language and foreign languages.

Adequate use of this equipment is more critical than ever because the risk of shortages must be balanced against the need to effectively protect health care workers, including prehospital personnel. Specific training is therefore necessary; however, the need for social distancing has markedly disrupted the delivery of continuing education courses. Electronic learning (e-learning) may provide significant advantages because it requires neither the physical presence of learners nor the repetitive use of equipment for demonstration. Objective: Inclusion of game mechanics, or gamification, has been shown to increase knowledge and skill acquisition. The objective of this research was to develop a gamified e-learning module to interactively deliver concepts and information regarding the correct choice and handling of PPE. Methods: The SERES framework was used to define and describe the development process, including scientific and design foundations. After we defined the target audience and learning objectives by interviewing the stakeholders, we searched the scientific literature to establish relevant theoretical bases. The learning contents were validated by infection control and prehospital experts. Learning mechanics were then determined according to the learning objectives, and the content that could benefit from the inclusion of game mechanics was identified. Results: The literature search resulted in the selection and inclusion of 12 articles. In addition to gamification, pretesting, feedback, avoiding content skipping, and demonstrations using embedded videos were used as learning mechanics. Gamification was used to enhance the interactivity of the PPE donning and doffing sequences, which presented the greatest learning challenges. The module was developed with Articulate Storyline 3 to ensure that it would be compatible with a wide array of devices, as this software generates HTML5-compatible output that can be accessed on smartphones, tablets, and regular computers as long as a recent browser is available. Conclusions: A gamified e-learning module designed to promote better knowledge and understanding of PPE use among prehospital health care workers was created by following the SERES framework. The impact of this module should now be assessed by means of a randomized controlled trial.";"22919279";9;"Canada";"Web of Science"

In pursuit of energy efficiency and true sustainability, buildings must acquire the ability to interact as well as to generate synergies. The most prominent features of this approach are energy management and information flows which, intelligently designed, not only enhance buildings' capabilities, but also introduce a significant change in their relationship with the surrounds ('smart cities') and its inhabitants. This new paradigm calls for revisiting undergraduate architectural instruction, adopting a more complex overview of energy use and management in the design process, regarding buildings as dynamic rather than static entities. The methodology focuses on creating learning environments that favour students' participation in problem solving and assessment, encouraging teamwork based on case studies and stressing the connection between this new architecture, ICTs included, and social networks as participatory design tools. These ideas were implemented in a pilot learning experience conducted at the University of Seville for undergraduate students. The use of ICTs and the collaboration of non-academic experts were observed to further student promotion and projection beyond the academic environment and introduce them to the professional community.";"26316862";5;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

However, the mechanisms of attention and processing of their contents and their consequences in learning have not been sufficiently studied. The objective of this work is to analyze how information is processed and learned and how visual attention takes place. It also investigates the existence of gender differences. The responses to 15 images are analyzed using Eye Tracking and EEG in a sample of 22 young students. The recall and liking of the stimuli is also analyzed. The characteristics of the images are evaluated by experts. The results indicate that there is a different pattern of visual activity between men and women which does not affect subsequent recall. The recall is determined by the emotional value of the image and its simplicity: more complex images demand more time of visual fixation but are less remembered. EEG responses confirm the importance of the playful component of the memory and low involvement processing. The conclusion is that the behavior against an app of this type resembles the low commitment behavior of advertising itself.

This study analyses factors affecting teachers' behavioural intention to use educational video games in their courses using a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) approach. The research model is tested via structural equation modelling (SEM) on a sample of 312 teachers in Higher Education institutions. Results suggest that perceived usefulness influences in a direct and positive way teachers' intention to use educational video games. Results also suggest that perceived ease of use indirectly influence intentions through perceived usefulness. Age was found to moderate the effect of teachers' perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness of EVGs.

The application of gamification in a pedagogical context provides some remedy for many students who find themselves alienated by traditional methods of instruction. The use of gamification could provide a partial solution to the decline in learners' motivation and engagement the schooling system is facing today. Specifically, the college environment could benefit a lot from gamifying not only their graduate recruitment strategies, but also the college course content and curricula. This critical analysis of literature on gamification is intended to be part of a sequence on the effect of gamification on motivation and engagement. A proposed methodology in the study of gamification effect on motivation and engagement in addition to an empirical study on three college courses are being finalized to complete this trilogy. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Themes covered in the literature review include: conceptualizing gamification, advantages of gamification over game-based learning, theoretical connections to gamification, motivation and engagement, connecting gamification to motivation and engagement, emotions and fun in gamification, player types and gamification features, gamification in action, and implementation guidelines. Findings - The literature on the effect of gamification on motivation and gamification is still limited on multiple levels. There is a gap between theory and practice in the study of gamification. There is limited literature on the implementation guidelines of the gamified designs. Practical implications - This critical analysis of literature is followed by connecting it to future research by the same author as part of a sequence on the effect of gamification on motivation and engagement. The second project, will be proposing a methodology for any successful design to provide a holistic understanding of the topic of gamification. Finally, an empirical study on the effect of gamification on students' motivation and engagement in three college courses will be submitted to complete the trilogy. Originality/value - This paper is a literature review, so there is a strong connection to literature on this topic. However, the synthesis of the themes and ideas are original. The literature review is extensive and covers the different aspects of the topic of gamification and its relationship to motivation and engagement.";"20564880";58;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

We identified gamification features, identified whether apps were consistent with evidence-based dentistry, performed a quality appraisal with the Mobile App Rating Scale user version (uMARS), and quantified behavior scores (Behavior Change score, uMARS score, and Coventry, Aberdeen, and London-Refined [CALO-RE] score) using three different instruments that measure behavior change. Results: Of 612 potentially relevant apps included in the analysis, 17 met the inclusion criteria. On average, apps included 6.87 (SD 4.18) out of 31 possible gamification features. The most frequently used gamification features were time pressure (16/17, 94%), virtual characters (14/17, 82%), and fantasy (13/17, 76%). The most common oral hygiene evidence-based recommendation was brushing time (2-3 minutes), which was identified in 94% (16/17) of apps. The overall mean uMARS score for app quality was high (4.30, SD 0.36), with good mean subjective quality (3.79, SD 0.71) and perceived impact (3.58, SD 0.44). Sufficient behavior change techniques based on three taxonomies were detected in each app. Conclusions: The majority of the analyzed oral hygiene apps included gamification features and behavior change techniques to perform and maintain oral hygiene in children. Overall, the apps contained some educational content consistent with evidence-based dentistry and high-quality background for oral self-care in children; however, there is scope for improvement.";"22915222";1;"Canada";"Web of Science"

The iSpring Learn learning management system was used as a low-tech gamification application in gamifying the flipped learning class. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research approach was used for collecting the data. Three formative assessments were used to examine students' learning performance during the intervention period, and a post-questionnaire survey was used to support the data collection process with regard to students' perceived needs satisfaction. In total, 56 students were involved in a non-randomised experiment with a control group design. Findings The results reveal that Assessment 1 showed no significant difference between the two intervention groups (p > 0.05), while Assessments 2 and 3 were significantly different (p < 0.05). The survey results confirm that participants in the GFC have achieved a great level of motivation because their innate psychological needs for competence, autonomy and relatedness are satisfied. Originality/value Gamification as a current concept of a twenty-first-century instructional skill has proven to be remarkably influential. This study suggests that the FC and gamification concept might be possibly implemented in a low-tech information environment - without the required advanced technology platform.";"23985348";3;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

Several studies state that the main limitations of the MOOCs are low completion and high dropout rates of participants. However, MOOCs suffer also from the lack of participant engagement, personalization, and despite the fact that several formats and types of MOOCs are reported in the literature, the majority of them contain a considerable amount of content that is mainly presented in a video format. This is in contrast to the results reported in other educational settings, where engagement and active participation are identified as success factors. We present the results of a study that involved educational experts and learning scientists giving new and interesting insights towards the conceptualization of a new design approach, the flipped MOOC, applying the flipped classroom approach to the MOOCs' design and making use of gamification and learning analytics. We found important indications, applicable to the concept of a flipped MOOC, which entails turning MOOCs from mainly content-oriented delivery machines into personalized, interactive, and engaging learning environments.

Playing is explored here, considering changes in student approaches to leisure, recreation and having fun and investigates how playing in general is changing. The purpose of this paper summarizes two scenarios about the playing domain from the Student Needs 2025+ project and highlights implications for the future of higher education. Design/methodology/approach - A modified version of the University of Houston's Framework Foresight method was used to explore the future of six aspects of future student life. Findings - Play has gotten serious. It is increasingly scheduled, supervised and often includes some larger objective, such as learning. This purposeful play is spreading into virtual space as well, which will increasingly be the setting for play. In the longer term, play - in the form or gamification - is likely to integrate into more and more of student life. Games and play will be used for teaching in the classroom (real and virtual), at work for training, to make exercise fun, and even in civic life for encouraging greater participation in governance. Research limitations/implications - In terms of research limitations, the paper is focused on the needs of students and does not purport to be an exhaustive analysis of all the issues influencing higher education. It views the future of higher education through the lens of students and their emerging needs.

Results from random effects models showed significant small effects of gamification on cognitive (g = .49, 95% CI [0.30, 0.69], k = 19, N = 1686), motivational (g = .36, 95% CI [0.18, 0.54], k = 16, N = 2246), and behavioral learning outcomes (g = .25, 95% CI [0.04, 0.46], k = 9, N = 951). Whereas the effect of gamification on cognitive learning outcomes was stable in a subsplit analysis of studies employing high methodological rigor, effects on motivational and behavioral outcomes were less stable. Given the heterogeneity of effect sizes, moderator analyses were conducted to examine inclusion of game fiction, social interaction, learning arrangement of the comparison group, as well as situational, contextual, and methodological moderators, namely, period of time, research context, randomization, design, and instruments. Inclusion of game fiction and social interaction were significant moderators of the effect of gamification on behavioral learning outcomes. Inclusion of game fiction and combining competition with collaboration were particularly effective within gamification for fostering behavioral learning outcomes. Results of the subsplit analysis indicated that effects of competition augmented with collaboration might also be valid for motivational learning outcomes. The results suggest that gamification as it is currently operationalized in empirical studies is an effective method for instruction, even though factors contributing to successful gamification are still somewhat unresolved, especially for cognitive learning outcomes.";"1040726X";30;"USA";"Web of Science"

Given the importance of motivation, educators can borrow ideas from game designers by using gamification - a process to re-frame a real life goal to be more appealing and achievable. A series of learning activities, developed to meet both cognitive and emotional needs, results in an engaging learning journey. Design/methodology/approach - The concept presented, based on PSI Theory, OCEAN Big Five character traits and player/learner archetypes, is that learners are motivated by three basic needs: affiliation, competence or certainty (assuming other physiological needs are met). Findings - Armed with insight into types of motivations at different phases, learner experience designers can create different learning journeys and user profiles. Learning activities can be planned for each need and phase based on changing motivations: collaborate and curate (affiliation), choice and ownership (certainty), challenge and accountability (competence). Research limitations/implications - Further research is needed in the area of gamification in education. A qualitative study should be conducted on preferred learning and assessment activities for each player archetype and, importantly, this research should represent broad samples and not be restricted to the online gaming community. Originality/value - Rather than focussing on an isolated unit of study, and asynchronous eLearning modules, learning designers can use modern technologies to seed and nurture learning communities where each person has an appealing pathway to enable them to move from novice to expert at their own pace in a spiral of satisfying learning.";"20425953";1;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

The idea is to break with traditional methodologies to connect with students through the didactic use of ICT. All this has meant a true innovation in the learning of some subjects, historically anchored to more traditional methods, such as the area of History, among others. Really, thinking about innovating is not just using technologies or including games in the classrooms (Gamification). It would be necessary to go further, encouraging critical thinking in the classroom, using our intelligences to the maximum as Howard Gardner (1983) contributed. In this article, we first analyze the reasons why it is necessary to innovate, change teaching methodologies and evolve in the digital career of Secondary Education and Baccalaureate in the area of History. Next, an educational experience of the use of ICT for the study of History is shown, analyzing the proposed ICT resources that, together with the development of Multiple Intelligences, open a great variety of opportunities for the proposed training to be complete and enriching.

Being a new form of aesthetic, cultural, social, and communicative experience, computer games are beginning to influence our everyday practices. Many of the processes in social life (production, labour, education, rest, communication) become mediated and playful. Game mechanics are used in non-game contexts (this process is called gamification), and due to this procedure, the experience of computer games is transmitted to the areas that are considered to entirely lack playfulness: war, pain, violence, corporeal feelings. All in all, nowadays many social relationships are formed by the game. For instance, the space of MMORPG often becomes a laboratory, where social skills are perfected, the first encounter with the other occurs, and the contours of new intersubjectivity are set. In games humans are even more unprotected than on the stage, in a reality-show, or on the battlefield because they cannot hide themselves behind the mask and have to open their face in front of the other to make the game happen. To begin the game, we let the Other (even if objectified in the form of rules) occupy our being. The article considers the examples of how the image of the Other is constructed in games, how the game space, the media field of the game, engenders certain ethical norms and ways of gaming behaviour. The way we look at each other is is determined by media, and in this sense, the game becomes more influential. This fact cannot be ignored by the social sciences, especially by those who explore media reality. Refs 33.";"25422278";3;"Russia";"Web of Science"

As an alternative, the 'Escape Room' teaching game is a much more dynamic option to asses theoretical and practical knowledge, and it may also promote teamwork and the ability to perform under pressure. Objectives: To analyse nursing students' opinions and study motivations after using the nursing 'Escape Room' teaching game. Design: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Participants: Second-year nursing students enrolled in the 'Adult Nursing 1' subject. Method After completing the teaching game, the students who had taken part in it were asked to fill in an ad-hoc questionnaire on the matter. In this game, students have 30 min in which they must solve the riddles and puzzles presented, and thus escape. In doing so, they must demonstrate both theoretical and practical knowledge, and a teacher will remain in the classroom to assess whether the nursing techniques in question are correctly performed. Results: The nursing students who took part in the game strongly believed that this 'helped them learn the subject' (4.8 points) and that 'more games of this type should be included in their nursing studies' (4.8 points). Overall, they considered that 'the game was enjoyable' (4.6 points), 'helped them in the exam' (4.6 points), and 'motivated them to study' (4.5 points). Conclusions: The 'Escape Room' is a useful game; it stimulates learning, is fun to play, and motivates studying.";"02606917";51;"Scotland";"Web of Science"

In particular, SLEs have been used to introduce, on a medium and large scale, gamification strategies as a complement to traditional learning procedures. In this context, the existence of gamified activities can probably change the type and strength of the social relationships encouraged by the SLE among students. In this case study, we examine an SLE endowed with gamification capabilities and discuss the interplay between the designed gamified tasks and the resulting network of communications among the agents. Our findings reveal that the network structure reflects the interactions within the class in a nontrivial way and conversely that the network structure can be used to anticipate or predict the evolution of the student groups throughout the course.

Background The role of gamification in promoting students' learning has been investigated empirically by many scholars. To date, mixed results about the effectiveness of gamification have been reported, and researchers frequently argue that the inappropriateness of certain techniques may have contributed to these mixed findings. Methodology The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol was used to assess the criteria required for this review A total of 40 studies were identified and included in the systematic review. The selected studies were used to assess the association between certain gamification techniques and students' learning in this study. Findings The results showed that gamification techniques differently affect students' learning. In addition, it is important for students to be instructed about the application of gamification approach before they engage in a gamified learning task. The key challenges relating to the use of gamification techniques were also discussed. Recommendations for Practitioners This review can help educational decision makers and practitioners to stimulate certain learning outcomes of the students with the help of specific gamification techniques.";"15479714";6;"USA";"Web of Science"

With respect to the gamified instruction, three types of gamification applications were employed: Socrative, Quizizz, and iSpring Learn LMS. The effects of the instructional intervention (n = 94), as well as evaluative feedback, were obtained with the aid of formative quizzes, post-questionnaire surveys, and personal interviews. The results showed that the employment of innovative gamified e-quiz applications (i.e., Socrative, Quizizz, and iSpring Learn LMS) and paper-based quizzes were effective in evaluating students' learning performance, particularly as formative assessment after completing each topic. Finding ways to apply games or game concepts in the classroom can be a promising and innovative tool for educators to engage their students in creative learning skills and attractive competition.";"03601315";24;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

Nevertheless, despite an increasing academic interest in EVGs little research has been devoted to delve into teacher's beliefs affecting their attitude towards EVGs and how these beliefs also affect their intention to use EVGs in their courses. Using Keller's ARCS model as a theoretical framework, the role of perceived relevance and attention in teachers' attitude and intention to use EVGs is analyzed. To do so a research model is tested using a sample of 312 Higher Education teachers via structural equation modeling to predict teachers' attitude and behavioral intention to use EVGs in their courses. Results suggest that perceived attention drawn by EVGs is a factor affecting teachers' intentions to use EVGs in their courses. Perceived relevance was not found to affect directly neither attitude nor intention to use while teachers' perceived attention was found to affect teachers' perceived relevance of EVGs.

Special attention is paid to the description of the data collection method interview-game, which I consider an adequate method for studying the children opinions. The methodical aspects of the interview-game usage are described. Analysis shows that children turn out to be unique experts of the world of childhood who, through a specially constructed conversation, can tell about their activity in the kindergarten and about their ideas for changing educational practices. Children emphasize importance of free playing with peers during the day, the specificity of care practices (eating and sleeping), the interaction tactics between the teacher and children, make their suggestions for creating more comfortable conditions in the kindergarten. Children turn out to be very creative innovators of practices to reconstruct the space of a kindergarten and to change the teacher's role and rules of communication.

The authors prove that one of the factors contributing to the effective development of the educational process in a modern higher education institution is the formation of prospective teachers' digital competence by means of gamification. The reason for that is the predominance of a new ideology based on gamification and digitalization of education, where traditional teachers are replaced by teachers-gamers, coordinators of online platforms and educational trajectories. It was found out that the result of prospective teachers digital training is formed digital competence, which consists of the following components: value-motivational, cognitive and operational ones. The research methods used to verify the formation of prospective teachers' digital competence by means of gamification according to certain criteria (motivational, cognitive, reflexive-corrective) have been described. The results of the conducted questionnaires, testing and interviews have given grounds to indicate the level of the prospective teachers' digital competence formation by means of gamification as mainly medium and low. On the basis of the obtained results, the technology of prospective teachers' digital competence formation by means of gamification has been developed and implemented at the following stages: professional-motivational stage, contentactivity, reflexive-correctional. The developed technology has been implemented under the following conditions: the integration of gaming tools into the process of prospective teachers training; the application of organizational and technical measures and methods of providing information security when working with digital educational technologies; the selection of the most effective digital educational technologies; the application of educational platforms for the development of digital learning projects. The following mobile applications aimed at prospective teachers' digital competence development have been used: DuoLingo, ClassDojo, Coursera, Brainscape, Socrative 101.

However, the pedagogical model used in these courses is frequently being criticized. Many researchers claim the application of active pedagogies in MOOCs in order to improve the student learning processes, as it has been shown in face-to-face courses. Nevertheless, some common features of MOOCs such as the heterogeneity of user profiles, the scale or the asynchronism can hinder the application of these active pedagogies. This paper explores twenty MOOCs, in different languages, platforms and knowledge domains to analyze in detail the current use of collaboration and gamification in such courses. Results show that although there is a trend to promote social interaction, there is a lack of underpinning pedagogical intentions to achieve collaborative outcomes, and when collaboration happens, it is mostly spontaneously, not pursued by the instructional design. Also, results show that gamification is frequently used as a motivational strategy, implemented for rewarding students' individual actions, lacking the recognition of collective achievements. Finally, there is evidence that MOOC platforms are often complemented with additional tools to support student interaction and gamification.";"11382783";2;"Spain";"Web of Science"

This review identifies interventions that use social media to promote nutrition, examines their content and features, and evaluates the evidence for the use of such platforms among these groups. Material and methods: We conducted a systematic search of 5 databases (PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and ACM Digital Library) for studies that included: 1) adolescents and/or young adults (ages 10-19; ages 18-25); 2) a nutrition education or behavior change intervention component, or outcomes related to nutrition knowledge or dietary changes; and 3) a social media component that allowed users to communicate or share information with peers. Results: 16 articles were identified that included a social media component in a nutrition-related intervention for adolescents or young adults. Interventions included features in 7 categories: social media; communication; tracking health; education; tailoring; social support; and gamification. 11 out of the 16 studies had at least one significant nutrition-related clinical or behavioral outcome. Conclusion: Social media is a promising feature for nutrition interventions for adolescents and young adults. A limited number of studies were identified that included social media.

The seminar The Lonely Patient is based on a real patient case and deals with the German health care system from the perspective of a patient. In order to create more space for discussion and exchange among students, the seminar was redesigned on the basis of the Inverted Classroom Method (ICM). Project description: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, new, purely digital teaching formats had to be developed quickly in the sense of Emergency Remote Teaching. Therefore, the Inverted Classroom concept of the seminar was transformed into an online ICM. In order to promote active learning based on the ICAP model (Interactive, Constructive, Active, Passive), the online face-to-face part was designed as a synchronous interactive learner-centered course using the gamified audience response system Kahoot! Results: Evaluation results to date and feedback rounds with students indicate that the online ICM-version of the seminar leads to at least as good evaluation results as the previous face-to-face course. In particular, the students positively emphasize the use of Kahoot! as an activating digital medium. Discussion: Through the use of the ICM and the gamified audience response system Kahoot!, students could be activated in meaningful ways. The resulting discussions about the patient case and teaching content of the quiz questions in the synchronous online course could be implemented just as well as in the classroom-based course of previous semesters. Conclusion: The application of the online ICM, along with the consideration of the ICAP Model, has led to the successful implementation of a digital course within the context of the increased difficulty surrounding the emergency remote teaching. Additionally, students' learning success has remained at a similar level as during traditional classroom-based courses of previous semesters.";"23665017";0;"Germany";"Web of Science"

We present a social gamification approach and tool designed to address the situated motivational affordances of students (relatedness, competence and autonomy). An experiment (N = 374) is conducted to test it in an undergraduate course, comparing students' performance with a traditional blended-learning approach. Students' attitude towards the new tool is also analyzed. Results suggest that social gamification can be used to improve the overall academic performance in practical assignments and to promote social interaction. However, our findings also raise and important caveat. The creation of gamified experiences for higher education requires a deep knowledge of the motivational affordances of students and a careful design of the rewards that are introjected by students and that eventually stimulate participation.";"0949149X";15;"Ireland";"Web of Science"

Using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to study the performance of competing teams in a web marketing serious game (Simbound), we highlight a combination of causal conditions (engagement, reach and profitability) affecting team rankings. This paper proposes a conceptual architecture of the forces that influence learning progress within a collaborative learning environment. This learning environment is studied for web marketing boot camps powered by Simbound at three European universities: Grenoble Alpes University (France), University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy) and Dunarea de Jos University of Galati (Romania). Gaining knowledge of cases through game learning analytics is valuable for two reasons: It emphasises the instructor's role in mobilising players' engagement, and it tests variability across cases, offering precursors of team performance rankings. This approach to collective skill retention highlights the moderating factors of team performance rankings, whilst purposely calibrating a gameable learning environment.

Inadequate geological knowledge affects not only university students but also the majority of citizens who finish their secondary studies without having learned any basic geological concepts. The insufficient geological training of pre-university teachers who are later expected to teach some geology generates a certain degree of insecurity and fear about teaching geology. Therefore, it is imperative to improve training for trainee teachers to replace usual ways of thinking about geology teaching with new approaches that promote significant geological learning. This research has a dual objective: first, we analyze whether trainee teachers' theses include geoscience content; second, we explore how innovative ideas and practices can be translated for educational purposes and to promote geologically significant learning. Our findings reveal that environmental impacts, plate tectonics and the hydrosphere are concurrent topics in the geosciences. However, trainee teachers in Spain prefer to develop biology units because many of them have training in bioscience fields of knowledge. Traditional education based on the exposition of learning material by the teacher was identified as the main learning environment developed in the trainee teachers' theses. However, the number of innovations incorporated into trainee teachers' theses has increased. Through this process, trainee teachers have a critical role to play: encouraging their future secondary students to develop geology knowledge.";"18672477";1;"Germany";"Web of Science"

Netland (2013), based on a study of production systems in 30 firms, considered that all production systems share the same principles and that these are similar to the Lean system's principles. From its beginnings, the Lean system has evolved and spread to all sectors, and, although it is not the objective of this contribution to explain the scope of Lean, we can confirm that the literature still has no agreed definition of Lean production and, in some way, the general purpose formulations of the concept diverge. However, it is clear that the roots of Lean production should be acquired by future engineers for them to become Lean Thinkers. Understanding and assimilating these concepts on the theoretical level can be complex and so adequate tools need to be employed. We aimed to do this through gamification with LEGO (c) sets. Gamification has evolved from activity based learning and is an innovative learning system designed to improve knowledge through experience. It is the process of adding games or game- like elements to something (such as a task) to encourage participation. The Lean Management concepts we worked with were (1) Production based on takt time, (2) Process synchronization, (3) Small lot production, (4) Waste elimination, (5) Setup time reduction, (6) Lead time reduction (7) Cross training, (8) Employee involvement, (9) 5S, (10) Standardized work, (11) Visual control and Management and (12) Supplier involvement. The experience consisted of building a small LEGO (c) structure and designing a balanced production line. The main aim was for students to acquire knowledge from the experience by highlighting ways to improve the production system and avoid waste through better planning and by applying some Lean practices. The experience was a complete success in terms of student involvement, and enjoyed satisfactory results in terms of Lean concept acquisition. In Conclusions, we categorize which Lean concepts were more easily consolidated through the game and propose improvements for subsequent experiences. Although the students acquired high levels of the abovementioned concepts, there were four concepts that did not meet the learning objective: Production based on takt time, Small lot production, Setup time reduction and Cross training. The problem was students did not have a standard framework within which to solve the case and, while proposing the concept of creating an innovative production system was solid, the lack of a standard framework made it difficult to compare the different solutions presented by the students. We hope this teaching experience will encourage Production and Operation management lecturers to adapt their lessons to this fascinating new way of teaching management concepts.";"1132175X";0;"Spain";"Web of Science"

Gamification in the classroom consists in the use of the game designed mechanically and structurally to teach through game(s). It is important to note the difference between a game and gamification. A game, which is understood as a finished product and something concrete, unlike the gamification part of a didactic content which may be defined as an activity that contains the elements found in a spirit of play. Through this innovative methodology, effort is rewarded and valued, not only achievement, through the use of badges. Through this methodology, the game is treated as a motivating element in the classroom, and moreover it is a methodology which is considered as an active one because the student must be active and be the main character in the learning process. METHOD. This work involves the translation and validation of a GAMEX scale (Gameful Experience in Gamification) that measures the gamified experience in English and German. The sample consists of 224 participants related to education and gamified experiences (52% teachers and 48% students). Exploratory factor analysis (AFE) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were carried out to confirm the dimensional structure of the scale. RESULTS. The results show the complexity of evaluating gamified experiences from a unique and valid perspective, since several dimensions come into play. There are valid instruments that do not take into account all dimensions, and this proposed instrument shows a higher acceptable level of adjustment than the original model. DISCUSSION. The multi-dimensional nature of the gamified experience is emphasized and the need to create an instrument to evaluate it and improve future gamified experiences is highlighted.";"02105934";5;"Spain";"Web of Science"

Stages take place at selected lecturing slots and for each stage, standings with times are allocated to the students based on the accuracy and speed of their replies. By computing the times of all stages, it is possible to obtain the overall standings. All this info is updated live during and right after each stage.

Still, many sub-Saharan African educators continue to confine these platforms to recreational activities. There is lack therefore of knowledge about how learners from sub-Saharan Africa perform such informal and experiential learning. This paper presents a case study of Tanzanian learners learning in informal settings using their mobile devices and MIMs. It deploys the rhizomatic learning theory with the aim of understanding how such learning occurs. Findings suggest that learners use mobile devices and MIMs to organize their personal learning spaces, to access specific content and to interact with peers on academic topics. Mobile devices and their MIMs are used as support in personal learning environments understood as multidimensional networks of heterogeneous multiplicities which rhizomatic maps situate, and contain knowledge, skills, and opportunities for innovation.";"19360282";0;"USA";"Web of Science"

Design/methodology/approach The use of the LEGO (R) SERIOUS PLAY (R) (LSP) method in the context of transformative learning in Higher Education was used to drive a Situational analysis with sixteen postgraduate nursing students, from African learning contexts. This methodological approach was used to specifically explore their identity as learners and then to facilitate processes of critical introspection on social constructivist learning opportunities. Findings Students' perceived LSP permitted a deeper level of critical introspection on their transformative learning journeys than alternative approaches, such as written discourse or extended narratives, could have provided. They also perceived that a major benefit of using the LSP method was that it enabled them to understand and articulate their stories more easily than if they verbally reported them first. Originality/value The methodological approach implemented in this paper provides a unique means of harnessing a now common gamification technique in pedagogic practice.";"20423896";0;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

'KAHOOT!' is an online multi-player real-time quiz game that allows students to measure learning in an engaging, immediate and entertaining manner. Lecturers can measure how well students absorb information and tailor their teaching to the next step or re-teach a concept after poor uptake by students. Seventy-two students participated in a 20-question survey about their experiences with 'KAHOOT!'. Engagement scores were correlated with assessment grades to measure if 'KAHOOT!' affected student learning and achievement. The survey was deemed statistically sound in reliability and validity testing, and a principal components analysis (PCA) revealed that the attributes were strongly linked. There was no relationship between engagement score and assessment grade, indicating that 'KAHOOT'!' did not directly increase achievement. However, assessment of individual responses identified that students found it to be a positive social learning technology as it provided a fun, competitive and immersive end to a class. The benefits of fostering engagement, enjoyment and immersion within adult learning are especially important for maintaining a level of achievement within education to ensure that students are better equipped to deal with challenges and can turn a potential failure into an opportunity to improve their scholarship.

Changes in the technological and social conditions of modern society need new professional skills, which are often called 21st century skills. These skills should be developed starting from the primary school, as they are psychological and behavioural, rather than practical. Game-based learning and gamification are effective means of such skills development. The use of video games in teaching practice is studied multifaceted, along with formats and requirements of educational game, methods for effectiveness assessment, and the effect of games on students. The controversial nature of game-based learning effect on students require deeper research, as the increase in motivation and learning efficiency cannot be disputed, as well as the negative impact of a long gaming on cognitive abilities, emotional state and social skills of students. The study tested both an increase in the motivation and attraction of school students for the learning process, and the impact on the practical results of information assimilation. There was conducted a survey on the results of the application of game training to determine the motivation and attraction of students. Likewise, we counted time, spent by the study and control group, for mastering the main educational material and the post-class study of game content and the educational material it presents. A comparative test was conducted on the results of educational material comprehension to determine the effectiveness of the methodology in mastering knowledge. The group, with game-based learning and gamification applied, showed an increase in motivation and attraction to learning, students paid additional efforts for assimilating the material studied, and also showed significantly higher learning outcomes compared to the control group.";"18630383";3;"Germany";"Web of Science"

Design: Structured observations and semistructured interviews. Setting: Low-income communities in 2 midsized urban areas. Participants: Fifteen African American adult and child (aged 5-10 years old) dyads recruited from community agencies. Phenomenon of Interest: Structured observation during the use of the virtual avatar coaching program and qualitative feedback on program experience after using the program. Analysis: Transcripts were independently coded by 2 trained coders. Content analysis was conducted to determine trends and patterns in responses, and salient quotes were extracted from the manuscripts. Results: The program generated dialogue between the children and adults around preferences and dietary habits. Adults and children described the program as being helpful, informative, motivational, and fun. Adults and children liked that the avatar acknowledged them at a personal level, provided accountability, and was tailored to them and their environment. Children wanted the ability to customize the avatar, more gamification, and avatar demonstration of healthy behaviors. Children felt the program would improve their health behaviors and were interested in using it again. Conclusions and Implications: This study highlights information that can be used to improve avatarbased programs for nutrition education with children and their adult caregivers who have low income. Future work should assess the impact of user customization experience, program impact on dietary behaviors, and resources required to scale and maintain the program with community agencies.";"14994046";0;"USA";"Web of Science"

The computer-based interactive multimedia simulations of scenarios for diagnosis and treatment allow for the avoidance of the risk of improper actions in regard to a real life patient, to repeat the clinical situations an unlimited number of times, and to standardize the tasks and criteria of their completion. Virtual patients represent a factual basis of problem-based learning. This review article focuses on the use of this educational technology for the development of medical decision making skills internationally, on its pedagogical effectiveness, and on the variants of the linear and branching scenarios. Meta-analyses demonstrate the pedagogical effectiveness of virtual patients and an interest of the trainees. An integration of the virtual patients into the learning contributes to clinical training gamification, which inspires the students and medical doctors to engage in interactivity and teamwork.

The purpose of this paper is to determine its potential in libraries to meet the needs of both users and librarians. The specific goals include: description of the main features of wearable computing from the perspective of its potential usefulness in libraries; analysis of areas of wearable computing use in public institutions; discussion of the potential of wearable computing for library users; and discussion of the potential of wearable computing for librarians to determine its potential in libraries to meet the needs of users and librarians. Design/methodology/approach The method of subject literature overview was used. The state of research from the period 2008 to 2018 on the use of wearable computing in libraries was established based on a search of selected sources Web of Science, Scopus, Elsevier and Emerald databases and LISTA database. Findings Wearable computing can be used in many areas of library activities to serve the needs of users and librarians. In the context of services for users, wearable computing can be used, among others, to help users navigate the library, to provide resources in new and interesting forms, and in education and entertainment. For the needs of librarians, additional data provided via wearable devices can accelerate the process of cataloguing resources and increase motivation to work via gamification options and features that make it possible to measure personal work efficiency. Librarians can also use the data obtained wearable computing devices to more quickly track, identify, select and organize resources. As with users, librarians can also use wearable computing in their education. Research limitations/implications - The paper is a viewpoint based on subject literature. It presents only a sketch of potential wearable computing applications in libraries. The aim of the paper is to initiate further discussion on the possibilities of using wearable devices to improve both services for users and internal library processes. The author's hope is that the concepts presented here will be tested in practice by librarians, which will allow further development of research on this subject. Practical implications - The results can be widely used in practice as a framework for the implementation of wearable computing solutions in libraries. Social implications The paper can help to facilitate the debate on the role of the implementation of new technologies in libraries. Originality/value The issue of the use of wearable computing has not yet been widely discussed in library and information science journals. In the very few publications on similar topics, only the perspective on the application of new solutions in services for users is presented. This paper also shows the potential for improving libraries' internal processes with the use of wearable computing.";"07378831";1;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"

Similarities and differences of the methods between gamification and games (as well as gamification and game based learning) have also been look upon up until now. However, gamification and game terms, are still being mentioned as substitutes for one another sometimes in many research articles. Although a mixture of methods are being used nowadays in the whole learning process (e.g. flipped learning together with gamification, mobile learning and infographics etc.), naming the whole learning methodology being used in an educational project/research only as gamification (or only as a game/GBL) - is yet another common issue that may lead us to misunderstand the gamification concept. These situations may be regarded as problematic issues in understanding the concept of gamification correctly. The number of educators and researchers keeps increasing in the world which are researching and trying to benefit from gamification applications in a variety of disciplines. Some of these disciplines (such as chemistry, health etc.) seems to be more benefitting and being more successful than others in their project states. Evaluating the level of success in various dimensions of learning may also differ from one to another largely in case of mixed learning methods being used in the research. Thus, in cases of using gamification method as well with others in a mixed manner of methods, the low level of success achieved may have been affected by a number of reasons. These reasons and conclusions have oriented the author to establish a research on articles and web resources on gamificaiton and its differentiations from games and game-based learning concepts. The intension is to better understand gamification, try contribute in drawing a clearer view of gamification for educators and researchers who are in the beginning stages of gamification/gamifying applications topic, or are planning to make use of them in the near future. With this perspective, a literature review was done, summerizing and commenting on the results which are reflected to this article aiming to clarify what gamification is, how it differs from games and game-based learning, familiarize with some successful gamification applications of today (in the education sector), underline how and why it is spreading in various application areas (including education) today and comment on the future of gamification use.";"23049650";12;"Russia";"Web of Science"

But it doesn't mean it cannot be treated as one! Fear of bad grades has never been the best way to motivate students. Often teaching activities are performed using the repetition of a model obtained with own experience as a student or, in the best cases, by trying to avoid the worst practices personally acknowledged as the most negative ones. The final goal - the diploma, at the end of the long university journey seems too distant to keep high morals during study. Here comes the question: how to prompt students to learning? Gamification, a term that applies almost solely to entertainment, is a way of engaging people's competitive drive and applying it to achieve their better performance. My ideas, described in the following paper, are basing on my own thoughts on games, mainly World of Warcraft and possible applications in university environment. In the World of Warcraft from the very first minute you start playing, the game constantly dangles a carrot on a stick in front of you. It could be a new ability, a powerful sword, or a cool mechanical chicken to ride on. Whatever it is, it's always just attainable enough that you'll say just one more quest! . Short and clearly marked steps allows player to monitor his progress and gives knowledge how to reach next level. Last but not least games have been primarily focused on competition, but nowadays it is also about cooperation to earn new achievements - both also most wanted in the didactics. This paper presents possible ways of introduction of gamification in education as well as their pros and cons.";"22516204";0;"Iran";"Web of Science"

As proof of concept, the authors introduce Zeus, a platform for developing ruled-based serious game applications with gamification techniques. Zeus aims at generating gamified applications that can meet the learning goals set by users. These goals will be reflected through both learning and game attributes that users can personally select. To assess the functionality of the authors tool, they conduct a qualitative evaluation of four rule-based serious game applications developed with Zeus to help students learn about arithmetic. They make use of the Fun Toolkit to perform this evaluation in terms of the delivery of both fun and learning experiences. Their findings are encouraging in the context of learning basic arithmetic operations with Zeus game applications.";"17518806";0;"ENGLAND";"Web of Science"
