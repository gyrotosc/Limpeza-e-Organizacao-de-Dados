In the following work, an innovation proposal is established for the implementation of a gamification strategy, allowing new educational practices to be incorporated in the classroom. All this aimed at encouraging the creative process and motivation in students to carry out their activities in a more attractive way. Based on this, an exploration of the different concepts of gamification and how they are applied in education is carried out, finding a diversity of authors who take gamification as a fundamental element to motivate the student to make an appropriate meaningful learning. This is how a gamified strategy is proposed, taking as main theme a film with which students are closely related Avengers, Infinity War, this being the starting point of motivation.;"[Mora Pedreros, Tania Isadora] Inst Univ Antonio Jose Camacho, Fac Ingn, Cali, Colombia; [Zapata Hoyos, Esperanza] Inst Univ Antonio Jose Camacho, Fac Educ Distancia & Virtual, Cali, Colombia";Pedreros, TIM (corresponding author), Inst Univ Antonio Jose Camacho, Fac Ingn, Cali, Colombia.;"timora@admon.uniajc.edu.co; ezapata@admon.uniajc.edu.co";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;19;0;0;0;0;ASOC COLOMBIANA, FAC INGENIERIAS;BOGOTA;CARRERA 68 D 25B-205 86 OFFICE, BOGOTA, 00000, COLOMBIA;1900-8260;NA;NA;REV EDUC ING;Rev.

Be these issues of mundane or universal importance, this judgmental forecasting poses people with a difficult pervasive cognitive challenge. Commonly, judgmental forecasting is taught in forecasting courses syllabi, and the pedagogy surrounding it is challenging. However, gamification and game-based learning have risen as promising tools to simulate different kinds of scenarios and stimulate cognitive problem solving. This study investigates the effects of a gamified application with points, levels, challenges, storytelling and leaderboard for teaching judgmental forecasting by conducting a 2 x 2 between-subjects experiment (treatments: i) read: yes vs no, and ii) gamification: yes vs no), with a sample of 285 students of a School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and a Business Administration Department. The findings indicate that the gamified application improved learning outcomes regarding the heuristics and biases that affect judgmental forecasting by almost 15%, supporting the use of gamification in forecasting education.;"[Legaki, Nikoletta-Zampeta; Hamari, Juho] Tampere Univ, Gamificat Grp, Kalevantie 4, Tampere 33100, Finland; [Legaki, Nikoletta-Zampeta; Assimakopoulos, Vassilios] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Forecasting & Strategy Unit, Heroon Polytech 9, Zografos 15780, Greece; [Karpouzis, Kostas] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Intelligent Syst Content & Interact Lab, Heroon Polytech 9, Zografos 15780, Greece";"Legaki, NZ (corresponding author), Tampere Univ, Gamificat Grp, Kalevantie 4, Tampere 33100, Finland.; Legaki, NZ (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Forecasting & Strategy Unit, Heroon Polytech 9, Zografos 15780, Greece.";NA;NA;NA;"European UnionEuropean Commission [840809]; Academy of Finland Flagship Programme [Forest-Human-Machine Interplay (UNITE)] [337653]";This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie [grant agreement ID 840809] and by Academy of Finland Flagship Programme [337653 -Forest-Human-Machine Interplay (UNITE)].

Research that explores local pharmacy student preferences of gamification aspects of serious games is scarce. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate local pharmacy student experience, preference, and perceptions of gaming and gamebased learning. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by distributing self-administered questionnaires among pharmacy students in Malaysia. Descriptive statistics, the Mann-Whitney test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the Spearman's correlation test were used for analysis. Results: A total of 328 pharmacy students enrolled in this study, and 84.1% (n = 276) had video game experience. Students usually played video games using mobile phones (n = 231, 70%). Pharmacy students showed positive perceptions regarding serious games with a mean score of 3.69. However, limited awareness and knowledge of serious games was observed among pharmacy students. The most preferred game genres were role-playing and strategy (n = 174, 53%). Pharmacy students also preferred playing a cooperative game style (n = 113, 34.5%) with scores as a reward system (n = 204, 62.6%). Over three quarters (n = 292, 89.3%) wanted to see the results of the assessment after the game. Conclusions: This research provided information on serious games preferences of local pharmacy students. Further study should evaluate the acceptance and effectiveness of the implementation of serious games among pharmacy students in Malaysia. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-analytic review to quantify the effects of gamified interventions on student behavioral change. Methods: A meta-analysis was performed using the following databases: The Academic Search Complete, Communication & Mass Media Complete, Education Source, ERIC, Library Information Science & Technology Abstracts, and PsycINFO. Inclusion in the review required: (a) peer-reviewed conducted between 2010 and 2019, (b) experimental controlled design, (c) gamification elements, and (d) educational setting. Results: Using a random-effects model, a statistically significant (Cohen's d (ES) = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.33, 0.62) gamification effect was evidenced by moderate and positive grand effects sizes (ES). Gamification effects were higher with adults in higher education (ES = 0.95) than K-12 students (ES = 0.92). Brief interventions delivered in days or less than 1 week were significantly more effective (ES = 1.57) than interventions lasting up to 20 weeks (ES = 0.30). Interventions incorporating gamification elements across years (ES = -0.20) was adversely associated with behavioral change. Conclusions: Findings suggest that short-term over longer-term gamified interventions might be a promising way to initiate changes in learner's behaviors and improve learning outcome.;"[Kim, Jihoon] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Phys Educ Teacher Educ, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Castelli, Darla M.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Kinesiol & Hlth Educ, Hlth Behav & Hlth Educ, Austin, TX 78712 USA";Castelli, DM (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Kinesiol & Hlth Educ, Hlth Behav & Hlth Educ, Austin, TX 78712 USA.;"jihoonkim@utexas.edu; dcastelli@utexas.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;62;0;0;2;2;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;1660-4601;NA;INT J ENV RES PUB HE;Int.

This study examined the effects of a program based on the hybridization of the Personal and Social Responsibility Model and gamification. A total of 58 students (13.89 years old, SD = 1.14) in two groups (experimental and control) participated during a complete academic year. Motivation, physical activity and sedentary behavior were assessed through questionnaires. Physical fitness was evaluated using previously validated field tests. The results showed significant differences over time between the experimental group (EG) and control group (CG) in afterschool physical activity (APA) during the weekend (p = 0.003), sedentary time (p = 0.04) and speed-agility (p = 0.04). There were no significant differences in motivation. In reference to the intervention, the speed-agility (p = 0.000), strength (p = 0.000), agility (p = 0.000), cardiorespiratory fitness (p = 0.001), APA-weekend (p = 0.000), APA-week (p = 0.000) and sedentary time (p = 0.000) increased significantly in the EG. The speed-agility (p = 0.000), APA-weekend (p = 0.03) and sedentary time (p = 0.008) increased in the CG.

The IDEAL challenge problem was created to more closely simulate a real-world scenario than typical homework or challenge problems. It added a more involved story, specific characters, simple interaction, and student-led inquiry into a challenge problem. Students analyzed musculoskeletal biomechanics data to conduct a forensic biomechanics investigation of an individual who suffered a fracture. Students ultimately approached the IDEAL problem with a greater appreciation and enjoyment than previous open-ended challenge problems-those that were assigned in a traditional problem-statement manner-throughout the semester. Students who were more fully engaged in the IDEAL challenge problem, as evidenced by the fact that they requested all of the evidence on their own, also performed better on the final report grade. This signals improved learning with respect to biomechanical analysis when the students were creatively participating in the storyline surrounding the forensic investigation.;"[Troutman, Valerie A.; Grimm, Michele J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Grimm, Michele J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA";Grimm, MJ (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.;mgrimm@msu.edu;NA;NA;"Catalyst Innovation Program at Michigan State University; Wielenga Creative Engineering Endowment at Michigan State University";This work is supported by the Wielenga Creative Engineering Endowment and the Catalyst Innovation Program (administered through The Hub for Innovation in Learning and Technology) at Michigan State University.

If they also use their mobile phones to escape from the classroom, the situation seems to get worse. Low attendance rates and poor academic results are some of the consequences of a serious problem: the lack of commitment of students to their learning process. Incorporating elements of games, together with new technologies, may be a possible solution. Thus, in the academic year 2018/2019 the classes of the subject Operations Management II taught throughout the fourth year of Business Administration and Management Degree offered by the University of Cadiz were gamified with Kahoot!

However, becoming familiar with the facts behind the periodic table such as the element names and/or symbols, their metallic character, their electronegativity, and so on, may seem a tedious and boring task, depending on the approach the teacher uses. One way to stimulate students is through so-called gamification, in which learning occurs as an almost undetected consequence of playing a game. Of course, the game must be designed and prepared in such a way that the game and learning come together. In this work, we present Chemical Battleship, a chemical version of the classic board game Battleship, to learn the main topics contained in the periodic table and identify the common glassware of the lab. Additionally, using this game facilitates presenting the chemistry from a fun approach to certain educational levels. The periodic table itself is used to deploy the fleet, which is actually just labware. The shots must be fired by identifying the chemical element the player wants to fire at, and they must do so by using different properties of the element. Repeating this process, students get soon familiar with the periodic table and the information it contains, as well as with the lab glassware. Chemical Battleship was tested with elementary school students and third-year students in a Primary Education Teacher Degree program. Use of this game had a high acceptance from both groups, awakening students' interest and curiosity in the first group and improving knowledge in the latter group. Students enhanced not only their subjective perception of their knowledge but also what they really know about the periodic table, as reflected in the improvement of their marks.;"[Gonzalez, Alfonso Fernandez] Univ Oviedo, Dept Quim Fis & Analit, Oviedo, Asturias, Spain; [Bernardo, Jose M.

Here we introduce a new app, MILAGE LEARN+, which integrates several teaching strategies, such as mobile learning, autonomous learning, peer review, blended learning, and gamification. These strategies were evaluated by the student users through an electronic survey form containing 15 statements with responses graded on a Likert-type scale. Students rate the usage of novel teaching/learning strategies in the MILAGE LEARN+ app as something very positive.

The pharmacists' unique knowledge of a medicine's chemistry enhances their understanding of the pharmacological activity, manufacturing, storage, use, supply, and handling of drugs. However, chemistry is a challenging subject for both teaching and learning. These challenges are typically caused by the inability of students to construct a mental image of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of a drug molecule from its two-dimensional presentations. This study explores a prototype virtual reality (VR) gamification option, as an educational tool developed to aid the learning process and to improve the delivery of the MC subject to students. The developed system is evaluated by a cohort of 41 students. The analysis of the results was encouraging and provided invaluable feedback for the future development of the proposed system.;"[Abuhammad, Areej; Tarawneh, Ruba T.] Univ Jordan, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Amman 11942, Jordan; [Falah, Jannat] Al Balqa Appl Univ, Fac Artificial Intelligence, Dept Autonomous Syst, Al Salt 19117, Jordan; [Alfalah, Salasabeel F.

This scoping review aimed to assess the evidence regarding the value of gamification as part of health science undergraduate education, in comparison to conventional teaching curriculum. Methods: A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMC are and Cochrane databases. Articles were eligible if they were randomised controlled trials comparing the use of gamification for undergraduate health profession students, with conventional teaching methods. Outcomes included knowledge (ie., information acquisition), skills (ie., knowledge application) and perceived benefit. Screening, data extraction and critical appraisal was conducted by two reviewers independently. Results: Eleven RCT studies were included (n = 997). Three of eight reporting studies discovered significant findings for knowledge acquisition scores favouring the intervention group. Varying results were demonstrated in the skills domain across six studies. Perceived benefits including student motivation and satisfaction levels demonstrated positive findings in all but one of six reporting studies. Discussion: Educators should supplement methods with gamified learning rather than replace them, consider group-based gamification, and employ methods at irregular intervals. Conclusion: The findings of this review suggest that gamification may be advantageous for health science undergraduates. Gamification positively impacts student satisfaction and motivation, though its capacity to enhance students' knowledge acquisition and application necessitates further research.;"[Arruzza, Elio; Chau, Minh] Univ South Australia, UniSA Allied Hlth & Human Performance, Adelaide, SA, Australia";Arruzza, E (corresponding author), UniSA Allied Hlth & Human Performance, 108 North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.;arres001@mymail.unisa.edu.au;NA;"CHAU, MINH/0000-0003-2306-3437; Arruzza, Elio/0000-0001-7328-6677";NA;NA;NA;39;0;0;1;1;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;NEW YORK;STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA;1939-8654;NA;NA;J MED IMAGING RADIAT;J.

It does not need particularly tall and large figures for playing football that it is extremely suitable for the figure of oriental people. For this reason, football is suitable for being promoted domestically. In the football teaching in PE curricula, it is discovered that most students are lack of interests in football. The effect of Teaching Method of Physical Education is an important issue concerned by physical education related people. PE workers should absorb innovative thinking and concepts with multiple methods to match the time trend, and teachers should understand the complementary relationship among teaching methods. Applying experimental design to the quasi-experimental study, 224 students at a university in Hainan Province are selected as the experimental research subjects for the 16-week (3 hours per week for total 48 hours) experimental teaching study. An experimental class (112 students) is taught with Teaching Games for Understanding integrated sport education model, and the control class (112 students) remains general traditional instruction.

This viewpoint encouraged the creation of QueryCompetition, a web system that allows students to practice SQL in a competitive environment. Our goal was to obtain empirical evidence on how gamifying elements, such as challenges, points, and leaderboards, integrated into QueryCompetition, affect student performance, motivation, and user experience. We carried out a quasi-experimental study with two groups in a Database course. One group used a gamified version of QueryCompetition having access to points and leaderboards, while the other used a non-gamified version with no access to the above mentioned elements. Quantitative and qualitative datawere collected through tests and a survey. The results showed that there was a statistically significant improvement in student performance in the gamified group as compared to the non-gamified group. In addition, a higher motivationwas observed in the gamified group. The empirical evidence presented in this article supports the claim that inclusion of challenges, points, and leaderboards, together with the competitive nature of QueryCompetition, impacts positively on student performance and motivation to practice SQL.;"[Morales-Trujillo, Miguel Ehecatl] Univ Canterbury, Comp Sci & Software Engn Dept, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Alberto Garcia-Mireles, Gabriel] Univ Sonora, Dept Matemat, Blvd Luis Encinas & Rosales S-N, Hermosillo 83000, Sonora, Mexico";Morales-Trujillo, ME (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Comp Sci & Software Engn Dept, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.;"miguel.morales@canterbury.ac.nz; gabriel.garcia@unison.mx";NA;Garcia-Mireles, Gabriel Alberto/0000-0003-4633-7410;NA;NA;NA;62;0;0;1;1;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA;1946-6226;NA;NA;ACM T COMPUT EDUC;ACM Trans.

The paper presents the implementation of an educational computer game regarding traffic behavior awareness through the main stages of analysis, design, development, and evaluation, aiming at investigating the contribution of gamification in traffic safety. The game was developed as an advanced media education approach in Unreal Engine, encompassing various adventures. The game hero's tasks are to move into the virtual city to complete a mission, follow road safety rules, and experience the adventures either as a pedestrian or as a vehicle driver. Research hypotheses/questions are tested concerning the gaming impact and the audience engagement through first-person storytelling to communicate and perceive traffic regulations. The results reveal that a properly developed educational game could become more engaging, amusing, and efficient.

Design: Structured observations and semistructured interviews. Setting: Low-income communities in 2 midsized urban areas. Participants: Fifteen African American adult and child (aged 5-10 years old) dyads recruited from community agencies. Phenomenon of Interest: Structured observation during the use of the virtual avatar coaching program and qualitative feedback on program experience after using the program. Analysis: Transcripts were independently coded by 2 trained coders. Content analysis was conducted to determine trends and patterns in responses, and salient quotes were extracted from the manuscripts. Results: The program generated dialogue between the children and adults around preferences and dietary habits. Adults and children described the program as being helpful, informative, motivational, and fun. Adults and children liked that the avatar acknowledged them at a personal level, provided accountability, and was tailored to them and their environment. Children wanted the ability to customize the avatar, more gamification, and avatar demonstration of healthy behaviors. Children felt the program would improve their health behaviors and were interested in using it again. Conclusions and Implications: This study highlights information that can be used to improve avatarbased programs for nutrition education with children and their adult caregivers who have low income. Future work should assess the impact of user customization experience, program impact on dietary behaviors, and resources required to scale and maintain the program with community agencies.;"[McGuirt, Jared T.; Enahora, Basheerah; Mallard, Lauryn] Univ N Carolina, Dept Nutr, 319 Coll Ave,318 Stone Bldg, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA; [Dyson, Omari L.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Peace & Conflict Studies, Greensboro, NC USA; [Tripicchio, Gina L.] Temple Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Ctr Obes Res & Educ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Rhea, Christopher K.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Kinesiol, Greensboro, NC USA";McGuirt, JT (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Nutr, 319 Coll Ave,318 Stone Bldg, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA.;jtmcguir@uncg.edu;NA;NA;Health Resources and Services Administration Maternal and Child Health Bureau's Grand Challenges for Preventing Childhood Obesity;Support for this article was provided by the Health Resources and Services Administration Maternal and Child Health Bureau's Grand Challenges for Preventing Childhood Obesity.;NA;24;0;0;1;1;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;NEW YORK;STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA;1499-4046;1878-2620;NA;J NUTR EDUC BEHAV;J.

The main challenge is to develop an engaging tool that at the same time reliably assesses cognitive constructs in students. To address these challenges, this research aims to improve cognitive assessment with a new game-based assessment app that has been designed and developed in collaboration with researchers, teachers, students, and software engineers based on established cognitive theories, and subsequently validated through iterative testing in real world settings. The iterative development process is based on design-based research and includes cycles of design explorations, testing, analyses, redesign, and evaluation with students in authentic educational settings.

Description of the Project This project involved the design of a healthcare-based escape room, where clinical nurses and interprofessional learners engaged in a series of puzzles and problem-solving experiences to apply clinical judgment and critical thinking about patient care. Theory and Frameworks Knowles' theory of adult learning guided the development of this gamified learning. Outcome The clinical nurse specialist was critical to the success of the escape room. The escape room created an innovative learning environment, expanding opportunities to engage staff and promote high-quality care for best patient outcomes. Conclusion The benefits of incorporating adult learning principles with gamification-based education as a teaching strategy are evident in the feedback and overwhelmingly positive responses received from participants. The successes of the sepsis escape room have presented opportunities to continue supporting progressive, fun, and evidence-based learning environments and positively impact both nursing education and patient care outcomes.;"[Dacanay, Adrian P.] Kaiser Permanente South Bay Med Ctr, Crit Care, Harbor City, CA USA; [Wyllie, Colleen] Kaiser Permanente South Bay Med Ctr, Director Educ, Harbor City, CA USA; [Sorrentino, Elizabeth] Kaiser Permanente South Bay Med Ctr, Profess Dev & Educ Dept, Harbor City, CA USA; [Sorrentino, Elizabeth] Kaiser Permanente South Bay Med Ctr, Step Down Unit, Harbor City, CA USA; [Sibrian, Julia; Dunbar, Ghada] Kaiser Permanente, Kaiser Permanente Southern Calif Patient Care Ser, Reg Nursing Profess Dev & Educ Program, 393 E Walnut St, Pasadena, CA 91188 USA";Sibrian, J (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente, Kaiser Permanente Southern Calif Patient Care Ser, Reg Nursing Profess Dev & Educ Program, 393 E Walnut St, Pasadena, CA 91188 USA.;julia.sibrian@kp.org;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;13;0;0;5;5;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;0887-6274;1538-9782;NA;CLIN NURSE SPEC;Clin.

Several question banks are available for ABSITE preparation. However, ABSITE Quest (AQ) utilizes a method called spaced education which has been demonstrated to help with retaining information longer and improve exam performance. This study hypothesizes that using this method will help residents improve their ABSITE performance. DESIGN: Retrospective survey data was collected from residents who participated in AQ, including postgraduate year (PGY) level, as well as 2019 and 2020 ABSITE percentiles. AQ user data was used to match respondent's total number of questions completed and daily engagement level to the survey data. Paired, single-tailed student's t test was used to evaluate the significance of ABSITE percentile change between 2019 and 2020 among AQ users. SETTING: ChristianaCare, Newark, DE, United States. Nonclinical. PARTICIPANTS: All ABSITE Quest users were surveyed (n = 390), of which 104 responded. 21 responses were from PGY1 residents and were excluded, resulting in a total of 83 responses. RESULTS: The mean percentile difference of AQ users from 2019 to 2020 was +15.8 (p < 0.00001). When categorizing by the total number of questions completed, high users demonstrated a mean percentile difference of +15.3 (p = 0.00002), average users had a difference of +19.1 (p = 0.00029), and low users showed a percentile difference of +1.2 (p = 0.45244). When categorizing by daily engagement level, high users demonstrated a mean percentile difference of +17.9 (p < 0.00001), low users had a mean percentile difference of +15.3 (p = 0.00124), and minimal users showed a mean percentile change of -5.7. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the spaced education method with ABSITE Quest, especially in users with a greater number of questions completed and high levels of daily engagement, correlated with a significant improvement on ABSITE performance.

DESIGN: Retrospective, cohort study. Level III evidence. Surgical interventions included long cephalomedullary nailing with gamification techniques compared to long cephalomedullary nailing alone. Main outcome measurements were total fluoroscopy time, operative time, hospital length of stay, discharge status, and complications. SETTING: Urban Level 1 Trauma Center. PARTICIPANTS: One fourty-eight adult patients with operative intertrochanteric femur fractures from January 2010 to January 2019. RESULTS: There were lower total operative times (45.6 vs. 57.1 minutes, p =< 0.01) and fluoroscopy times (1.6 vs. 2.1 minutes, p = 0.01) in the gamification group. There were no significant differences between groups in patient demographics, fracture pattern, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, total follow-up, total ICU stay time, or discharge to extended care facility versus home. CONCLUSIONS: Gamification techniques with use of long cephalomedullary nails are a valid approach to the treatment of intertrochanteric femur fractures. This approach demonstrates equivalent outcomes postoperatively to nongamification treatment of intertrochanteric femur fractures, with the potential advantage of decreased operative and fluoroscopic times.

This study aims to express several constructs that explain how one can apply Game-Based Learning to education while granting motivational success, attitudes, flow and learning. In this sense, in the present article, several theories have been used and related to each other, namely Landers' Theory of Gamified Learning, Self Determination Theory, Flow Theory, and Planned Behaviour. The aim was to understand how Motivation, Flow and Attitude dimensions, which were obtained by applying Games Based Learning resources to the teaching of Accounting, can influence Perceived Learning. These constructs were examined to see how they influenced the Perceived Learning of Accounting (N = 816) college undergraduates who used AccountinGame like a quiz with contents learned in the classes. This research contributes to the current body of literature on Game-Based Learning in Accounting Education. Results clearly showed there is a robust relationship between the proposed framework dimensions. In this sense, after students had used games in Accounting curricular units, it was observed that Motivation and Attitudes influenced Perceived Learning, unlike Flow, which had no statistical influence.;"[Silva, Rui; Leal, Carmem] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Dept Econ Sociol & Management, CETRAD, Vila Real, Portugal; [Rodrigues, Ricardo] UBI, NECE, Dept Management & Econ, Univ Beira Interior, Covilha, Portugal";Silva, R (corresponding author), Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Dept Econ Sociol & Management, CETRAD, Vila Real, Portugal.;ruisilva@utad.pt;"Leal, Carmem/V-7073-2017; Silva, Rui/I-1473-2017; Rodrigues, Ricardo/A-7722-2010";"Leal, Carmem/0000-0002-7860-9858; Silva, Rui/0000-0002-0283-9462; Rodrigues, Ricardo/0000-0001-6382-5147";national funds through the FCT-Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [UIDB/04011/2020];This work is supported by national funds through the FCT-Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology under the UIDB/04011/2020.;NA;134;0;0;2;2;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0963-9284;1468-4489;NA;ACCOUNT EDUC;Account.

In addition, the children were introduced to the Cally App in which they were asked to provide a balanced diet to a virtual pet. The Usage of the app remained voluntarily. Results The duration of app use in the school year 2017/18 averaged 10.34 days of play (arithmetic mean). The median was 4 days. Conclusion During the first lessons of the intervention, the children showed great enthusiasm for the app; however, contrary to our expectations, it was used very little over the course of the entire school year.

We combine four approaches to science outreach - gamification, social media platforms, community event(s), and creative products - to run a simulated tournament in which 64 animals compete to become the tournament champion. While the encounters between the animals are hypothetical, the outcomes rely on empirical evidence from the scientific literature. Players select their favored combatants beforehand, and during the tournament scientists translate the academic literature into gripping play-by-play narration on social media. To date similar to 1100 scholarly works, covering almost 400 taxa, have been transformed into science stories. March Mammal Madness is most typically used by high-school educators teaching life sciences, and we estimate that our materials reached similar to 1% of high-school students in the United States in 2019.

The sample consisted of 10 pre-service teachers, who in their fourth year of pre-school education in the teaching department in 2017 to 2018. The pre-service teachers in the study group were selected from those with a grade point average (GPA) of above 3 and who completed the teaching practice course. In the research, the data were collected from the pre-service teachers through interviews. A semi-structured form, developed by the researcher, was used as a data collection tool in order to reveal the opinions of pre-service pre-school teachers on the application of mathematics activities. The results of the research show that the participating pre-service pre-school teachers used more than one-to-one correspondence in mathematics activities of which the most difficult concepts were classification and geometrical figures - difficult situations in which to attract the attention of children and a crowded class of 36 to 48 month old children. Most of the mathematics activities were integrated into games and art through the narration and gamification method.

Visualization literacy skills are vital in understanding the world around us and constructing meaningful visualizations, yet, how to better develop these skills at an early age remains largely overlooked and understudied. Only recently has the visualization community started to fill this gap, resulting in preliminary studies and development of educational tools for use in early education. We add to these efforts through the exploration of gamification to support learning, and identify an opportunity to apply role-playing game-based designs by leveraging the presence of narratives in data-related problems involving visualizations. We study the effects of including narrative elements on learning through a technology probe, grounded in a set of design considerations stemming from visualization, game design and education science. We create two versions of a game - one with narrative elements and one without - and evaluate our instances on 33 child participants between 11- to 13-years old using a between-subjects study design. Despite participants requiring double the amount of time to complete their game due to additional narrative elements, the inclusion of such elements were found to improve engagement without sacrificing learning; our results indicate no significant differences in development of graph-reading skills, but significant differences in engagement and overall enjoyment of the game.

The objective of this study is to examine the existing evidence on the impact of educational gamification on student motivation and academic performance in the last five years in order to analyze its distribution over time, educational level, variables, and most used game elements, and know the advantages of its implementation in the classroom. For this, a systematic review is proposed through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology in three multidisciplinary databases, through an exhaustive search with inclusion and exclusion criteria on quantitative experimental studies that explore gamification in educational centers, which provide information about the most current lines of research. Fourteen studies were included in this review. These used experimental or quasi-experimental designs. Most of them report gamification as a valid learning strategy. The results support the conclusion that educational gamification has a potential impact on the academic performance, commitment, and motivation of students.

Using a design-based method, we conducted a qualitative single-case study in which the professor observed the process and guided the student's self-learning in a fun way. Under this guidance, the student made decisions alone in order to simulate a sustainable city, and afterwards to analyse the findings. Three variables were considered in order to evaluate the results concerning the quality of the student's learning: (1) the experiment using the game, (2) motivation, and (3) the skills acquired. In all three, the student earned a high score. Of the 12 skills established as the specific goals of the teaching plan, the student reached a very high level in 10, and a high level in two, implying the overall success of the learning process.

Disease self-management is essential for adequate metabolic control to prevent acute and long-term complications. Yet common methods of diabetes self-management education, such as lectures or pamphlets, lead to low knowledge, engagement, and clinical outcomes. Game-based learning has led to increased motivation, engagement, and productivity overall with substantial increases in self-management of chronic diseases in children. The purpose of this article is to review and synthesize literature on the impact on self-management knowledge, behavior, and engagement of the game-based interventions of serious games and gamification for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Nine studies were reviewed. Results showed statistically significant differences in knowledge, behavior, and engagement in response to the game-based interventions. Knowledge outcomes were found most significant in serious game interventions, while behavioral outcomes were predominantly found in gamification/serious game combination interventions. Findings also reveal there was inconsistent use of theories for game development and moderate to low quality of evidence across studies. While the nine studies reviewed strongly demonstrate the potential of game-based tools to significantly improve type 1 diabetes self-management care, further studies with expanded and more rigorous study parameters are recommended before an outright change in practice may be applied. The potential impact of the clinical nurse leader in the use and research of game-based interventions is also discussed.;"[Rewolinski, Jennifer A.; Kelemen, Arpad] Univ Maryland, Dept Org Syst & Adult Hlth, 655 W Lombard St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Liang, Yulan] Univ Maryland, Dept Family & Community Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA";Kelemen, A (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Org Syst & Adult Hlth, 655 W Lombard St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.;"jrewolinski@umaryland.edu; kelemen@umaryland.edu; liang@umaryland.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;48;0;0;0;0;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;1538-2931;1538-9774;NA;CIN-COMPUT INFORM NU;CIN-Comput.

Here, gamification uses typical elements of a game in different contexts, including that of education. Specifically, Escape Room games used as educational tools have potential for teaching-learning, and they can be beneficial because they can improve students' motivation and emotions toward learning. This is particularly valuable in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses, where the cognitive factor and multidimensional domain are closely connected. This research presents an online-based Edu-Escape Room with science and sustainability contents as an educative tool in a STEM course. With the intervention proposed, we analyze how this tool influences the multidimensional domain (attitudes, self-efficacy and emotions) of pre-service teachers (PSTs). According to attitude and self-efficacy analysis, it is observed that most of the items analyzed show an increase in self-efficacy and more positive attitudes after the intervention. In particular, Question 11 (Q11) indicates a significant difference. Concerning the results for emotion, the positive emotions joy, satisfaction and fun are significantly increased after the intervention. However, the negative emotions nervousness, frustration and concern also increase, partly due to the game characteristics. The proposed activity had a medium effect on items with significant differences except for the emotion frustration, where the intervention had a large effect according to effect size (ES) analysis. According to the principal component analysis (PCA), the attitudes, self-efficacy and emotions of the PSTs are positively correlated, and the influence of the proposed activity shows a significant improvement in these variables. Finally, the structural equation modeling partial least squares (SEM-PLS) analysis showed the effects that the instruction has on the PSTs' emotions and also that they had a significant effect on the positive attitudes towards and self-efficacy in science. Therefore, there are multiple benefits in the multidimensional domain of PSTs of having implemented the proposed online-based Edu-Escape Room.;"[Yllana-Prieto, Felix; Jeong, Jin Su; Gonzalez-Gomez, David] Univ Extremadura, Dept Didact Ciencias Expt & Matemat, Caceres 10003, Spain";Jeong, JS (corresponding author), Univ Extremadura, Dept Didact Ciencias Expt & Matemat, Caceres 10003, Spain.;"feyllanap@unex.es; jin@unex.es; dggomez@unex.es";Jeong, Jin Su/L-4968-2014;Jeong, Jin Su/0000-0003-1370-0623;Consejereria de Economia, Ciencia y Agenda Digital de la Junta de Extremadura y Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) [IB18004];The authors gratefully acknowledge the Consejereria de Economia, Ciencia y Agenda Digital de la Junta de Extremadura y Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER)-Project IB18004, which support this research possible.;NA;67;1;1;4;4;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2071-1050;NA;SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL;Sustainability;FEB;2021;13;3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;1032;10.3390/su13031032;NA;NA;18;"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies";"Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology";QD6QR;WOS:000615640600001;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

This has posed several challenges in terms of skilled and prepared professionals that have always to be up to date in an industry that is constantly changing. Thus, teaching tools have gained an increasing interest. The present research reviewed the state of the art in terms of digital interactive training tools pinpointing that the existing options do not feature the user involvement in the development of the training material. Hence, the main aim of this paper is to develop and test an innovative method based on gamification to increase wind energy sector industrial skills, providing a digital interactive environment in the form of a new user-friendly software that can allow its users to train and contribute to the teaching and learning contents. The first methodological step deals with the associated background studies that were required at strategy implementation and development stages, including market analysis and technology trade-offs, as well as the general structure and the implementation steps of the software design. Obtained results pinpointed that with minimal use of web-based database and network connectivity, a mobile phone application could work in the form of a time-scored quiz application that remotely located staff at wind energy farms could benefit from. The technological innovation brought by this research will substantially improve the service of training, allowing a more dynamic formative management contributing to an improvement in the competitiveness and a step towards excellence for the whole sector.

We developed an online educational game designed to enhance core media and information literacy competencies and to help young adults become information literate citizens. We examined the game's effects on skepticism toward online information and information discernment skills, two of the most important MIL competencies. In an online experiment, a total of 210 participants between 20 and 29 years of age were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the game group that played the developed online game, the quiz group that completed a quiz with no game element, and the control group that did not receive any treatment. Before treatment, the participants' perceived levels of intellectual civic skills were measured with a pre-questionnaire. After treatment, skepticism toward online information and information discernment skills as learning outcomes were measured with survey items on skepticism toward online information and an information discernment skills test, respectively. The results showed that the game effectively enhanced the cognitive aspect of media and information literacy (information discernment skills), but not the attitudinal aspect (skepticism toward online information). In addition, the game was found to be effective regardless of the participant's perceived level of intellectual civic skills, while quiz with no game element was found to be effective only when the participant's perceived level of intellectual civic skills was high. These findings demonstrate the importance of digital game-based intervention as an educational resource.

Self-management support is an important component of chronic illness care and is a key pillar of the chronic care model. Face-to-face teaching and patient education materials suffer from being static or incompatible with mobile lifestyles. Digital apps provide a self-management support alternative that is convenient and scalable. Objective: This pilot study tested the real-world deployment of a self-guided mobile app for diabetes education (Time2Focus app; MicroMass Communications Inc, Cary, NC), which utilizes evidence-based content and gamification to deliver an interactive learning experience. Methods: Primary care providers were approached for permission to invite their patients to participate. Eligible patients were 18 to 89 years of age, had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) >= 8% and <12% in the past 3 months, an active online patient portal account (tied to the electronic health record), and access to an iOS or Android smartphone. Interested patients were emailed a baseline survey, and once this was completed, were sent instructions for downloading the Time2Focus app. After completing all 12 levels, participants were sent a follow-up survey. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes included medication adherence, self-care activities, self-reporting of physical activities, diabetes self-efficacy, illness perceptions, diabetes distress scale, and users' engagement with and rating of the app. Results: Of 1355 potentially eligible patients screened, 201 were consented. Of these 201 patients, 101 (50.2%) did not download the app. Of the 100 participants (49.8%) who downloaded the app, 16 (16.0%) completed 0 levels, 26 (26.0%) completed 1 to 4 levels, 10 (10.0%) completed 5 to 11 levels, and 48 (48.0%) completed all 12 levels of the app and the follow-up survey. Those completing one or more levels had a mean pre/post-HbA1c change of -0.41% (compared to -0.32% among those who completed zero levels); however, the unadjusted two-tailed t test indicated no significant difference between the two groups (P=.73). Diabetes self-efficacy showed a large and significant increase during app usage for completers (mean change 1.28, P<.001, d=.83). Severity of illness perceptions showed a small but significant decrease during app usage for completers (mean change -0.51, P=.004, d=.43). Diabetes distress showed a small but significant decrease during app usage for completers (mean change -0.45, P=.006, d=.41). The net promoter score was 62.5, indicating that those who completed all levels of the app rated it highly and would recommend it to others. Conclusions: Participants who engaged in all 12 levels of the Time2Focus mobile app showed an improvement in diabetes self-efficacy and a decrease in severity of illness perceptions. The decrease in HbA1c observed in app users relative to nonusers during this limited pilot study was not statistically significant. However, uptake and application of lessons learned from self-management support may be delayed. Further research is needed to address how to increase engagement through self-management support and to investigate if follow up over a longer period demonstrates a significant change in outcomes such as HbA1c.";"[Batch, Bryan C.; Spratt, Susan E.] Duke Univ, Div Endocrinol Metab & Nutr, Sch Med, DUMC 3031, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Blalock, Dan, V] Durham Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Ctr Innovat Accelerate Discovery & Practice Trans, Durham, NC USA; [Blalock, Dan, V] Duke Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Sch Med, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Benditz, Chad; Weiss, Andi] MicroMass Commun Inc, Cary, NC USA; [Dolor, Rowena J.; Cho, Alex H.] Duke Univ, Dept Med, Div Gen Internal Med, Sch Med, Durham, NC 27710 USA";Batch, BC (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Div Endocrinol Metab & Nutr, Sch Med, DUMC 3031, Durham, NC 27710 USA.;bryan.batch@duke.edu;NA;"Blalock, Dan/0000-0002-8349-9825; Dolor, Rowena/0000-0001-7317-9468";"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [KL2TR001115]; Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Academic AffiliationsUS Department of Veterans Affairs [TPH 21-000]";This work was supported by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health (BCB, grant number KL2TR001115).

The app contains information about early childhood caries, health diet, sugars, baby-oral hygiene, fluoride effect, fluoride toothpaste, tooth-brushing training video and regular dental visits. The opinion of experts and 3 mothers were obtained and both apps were revised accordingly. The intervention was implemented on mothers of preschoolers referring to the specialty dental clinic of Tehran School of Dentistry in 2019. The mothers were randomly allocated to the simple app or gamified app group. Before the intervention, all mothers filled out a questionnaire regarding oral health knowledge and practice, and their demographics were collected. The plaque index (PI) of children was also measured. The mothers filled out the same questionnaire 1 month after the intervention, and the PI of children was measured again. Paired t test and linear regression model were used for statistical analysis of the data.ResultsTotally, 58 mother and child pairs entered the study; 40% of children were boys. The mean age of children was 4.71.2 years. The mean knowledge score of mothers in the pretest was 10.5 and 11.3 in simple app and gamified app group, respectively, which changed to 13.1 and 14.3, respectively in the posttest. The mean practice score of mothers was 4.4 and 4.8 in simple app and gamified app groups, respectively in the pretest, which changed to 8.5 and 8, respectively in the posttest.

In this regard, the purpose of the study is to analyze the prospects for using mobile training and gaming applications as a means of fixing and diagnosing language mistakes and controlling the acquisition. The object of research includes the methods of application of mobile learning game apps in teaching Russian. The theoretical and methodological basis included modern Russian and foreign studies devoted to the problems of the use of electronic gaming technologies, specifically those based on computer modeling of interactive 3D space, mobile technologies, computer games and applications in Russian language teaching. The article employs a complex of methods adequate to the object of study: the method of direct observation; description including observation, data comparison, classification of research objects, generalization and interpretation of the information received. It also uses empirical methods such as analysis and generalization of pedagogical experience, methodological experiment and questionnaires. The study has resulted in a description and characterization of the use of mobile educational and gaming applications in teaching Russian basing on the example of the app Priklyucheniya Kiberkota (The Adventures of Cybercat). The perspectives of use of this type of apps as a learning tool are analyzed in linguometodological aspect, based on the results of the experiment, and in the aspect of pedagogical psychology, based on answers to the questionnaire. The implicit control principle was formulated, and the place of educational and gaming applications in the general classification of mobile software was determined. The article also discusses the concepts of gamification and educational cyberquest in the field of mobile educational and gaming applications. The research results can be used in the design and development of educational and game software systems and applications. The expansion of the practice of using such electronic educational systems will open up new vistas in the Russian language teaching and self learning. The main expected results of using such applications are: optimization of the format of extracurricular education, an increase in motivation and a decrease in the negative psychological effects of students' perceptions of the educational process.

As a research discipline, gamification is growing fast, maturing from basic and fundamental questions such as what and why gamify to more mature ones such as how to gamify, when and when not, and still facing empirical and theoretical challenges to prove the effects of its practice and consolidate the principles that guide meaningful gamification designs. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a bibliometric study to describe how gamification as a scientific discipline is structured and how it has evolved over time. To do this, we make use of bibliometric performance analysis and science mapping methods to display and analyze the intellectual, conceptual and social network structures of gamification research, as well as the evolution and dynamical aspects of the discipline. The results reveal the research fronts and intellectual structures of the field, the internal relationships among articles, authors and keywords, the existing networks of collaboration, the emerging trends, the hot topics, and the most influential authors, publications and sources. Together, they picture the intellectual landscape of gamification as a scientific field that will be useful for junior and senior researchers, practitioners, funding agencies and policymakers.;"[Trinidad, Manuel; Ruiz, Mercedes; Calderon, Alejandro] Univ Cadiz, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Cadiz 11519, Spain";Ruiz, M (corresponding author), Univ Cadiz, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Cadiz 11519, Spain.;mercedes.ruiz@uca.es;Ruiz, Mercedes/L-7317-2013;Ruiz, Mercedes/0000-0002-8527-4734;"Spanish National Research Agency (AEI); ERDF funds [PID2019-105455GB-C33]; Andalusian Plan for Research, Development and Innovation [TIC-195]";This work was supported in part by the Spanish National Research Agency (AEI) and ERDF funds under Grant PID2019-105455GB-C33, and in part by the Andalusian Plan for Research, Development and Innovation under Grant TIC-195.;NA;300;0;0;2;2;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;NA;NA;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;NA;2021;9;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;46505;46544;NA;10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3063986;NA;NA;40;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";RI8SY;WOS:000637177100001;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Understanding learners' perceptions of virtual classrooms can help inform current and future best practices for online, synchronous, graduate medical education. Methods: We surveyed emergency medicine and internal medicine residency programs at a large urban academic medical center about their perceptions of synchronous online residency conferences. Results: Residents reported a preference for in-class interactions with peers (85%) and lecturers (80%), with 62% reporting decreased levels of engagement with lecturers during online conferences. Residents reported performing nearly twice as many non-conference-related activities (eg, email, exercise) during online conferences vs in-class conferences. Residents felt that the following methods improved engagement during online conferences: lecturers answering chat questions; small group sessions; and gamification of lectures. Conclusion: Synchronous online residency conferences were associated with decreased engagement and attention by learners. Simple methods to increase interactivity may help improve the online classroom experience and cultivate novel teaching environments that better support current learning styles.";"[Weber, William; Ahn, James] Univ Chicago, Sect Emergency Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave MC5068, Chicago, IL 60637 USA";Weber, W (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Sect Emergency Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave MC5068, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;wweber@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;5;0;0;0;0;WESTJEM;ORANGE;C/O SHAHRAM LOTFIPOUR, MD, MPH, 333 CITY BLVD W STE 640, RT 128-01, ORANGE, CA 92868 USA;1936-900X;1936-9018;NA;WEST J EMERG MED;West.

The advent of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has fundamentally changed these traditional learning opportunities by causing a nationwide reliance on virtual education environments and reducing the clinical diversity of cases encountered by EM trainees. We propose an innovative case conference that combines low-fidelity simulation with elements of gamification to foster the development of clinical reasoning skills and increase engagement among trainees during a virtual conference. After a team of residents submits a real clinical case that challenged their clinical reasoning abilities, a different team of residents plays through a gamified, simulated version of the case live on a video conference call. The case concludes with a facilitated debriefing led by a simulation-trained faculty, where both the resident teams and live virtual audience discuss the challenges of the case. Participants described how the Challenging Case Conference improved their perceptions of their clinical reasoning skills. Audience members reported increased engagement compared to traditional conferences. Participants also reported an unexpected, destigmatizing effect on the discussion of medical errors produced by this exercise.

This research attempts to analyze the concept of gamification and its components, types of players, and conditions for successful design by reviewing the literature. In addition, the research aims to investigate how the gamification design process can be used in education and what empirical effects are expected. The research also aims to propose a conceptual framework for gamification integration in eLearning systems based on the instructional design (ID) model. The methodology used in the identification of successful strategies and experiences is based on reviewing the literature that explains gamification, game strategies, and previous gamification frameworks. Examples and suggestions of gamification are included. The findings illustrate the potential techniques for applying gamification in eLearning systems, especially e-courses. The differences between Digital Games, gamebased learning, and gamification are discussed. The findings propose a conceptual framework for gamification integration in eLearning systems based on the ID Model. Gamification has been incorporated into the general phases of the ID model, namely, analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. The findings help decision-makers and stakeholders at higher education institutions differentiate between games, game-based learning, and gamification integration into education and determine suitable ID models as conceptual frameworks for systematically delivering learning content through gamification.;[Yamani, Hanaa Abdulraheem] Umm Al Qura Univ, eLearning Informat Sci Dept, Mecca, Saudi Arabia;Yamani, HA (corresponding author), Umm Al Qura Univ, eLearning Informat Sci Dept, Mecca, Saudi Arabia.;Hayamani@uqu.edu.sa;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;58;0;0;0;0;KASSEL UNIV PRESS GMBH;KASSEL;DIAGONALE 10, D-34127 KASSEL, GERMANY;1863-0383;NA;NA;INT J EMERG TECHNOL;Int.

However, conducting educational escape rooms effectively is very complex and there are no software tools available for this purpose. This lack of support is hindering the widespread use and adoption of these activities. This article presents Escapp, a web platform that allows teachers to conduct effective and highly engaging educational escape rooms. The platform has been used for conducting three different educational escape rooms (one face-to-face and two remotely) in three higher education settings. Three case studies were conducted to empirically evaluate the usefulness of Escapp for conducting these activities, which involved more than 400 students. On the one hand, a questionnaire was administered to students to gather their opinions on the Escapp platform, obtaining very positive results in terms of overall usefulness, usability and engagement. On the other hand, data automatically recorded by Escapp during the three educational escape rooms are presented as evidence of the high number of student interactions that take place during activities of this kind and the need of using a software system for conducting them in an effective way.

The seminar The Lonely Patient is based on a real patient case and deals with the German health care system from the perspective of a patient. In order to create more space for discussion and exchange among students, the seminar was redesigned on the basis of the Inverted Classroom Method (ICM). Project description: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, new, purely digital teaching formats had to be developed quickly in the sense of Emergency Remote Teaching. Therefore, the Inverted Classroom concept of the seminar was transformed into an online ICM. In order to promote active learning based on the ICAP model (Interactive, Constructive, Active, Passive), the online face-to-face part was designed as a synchronous interactive learner-centered course using the gamified audience response system Kahoot! Results: Evaluation results to date and feedback rounds with students indicate that the online ICM-version of the seminar leads to at least as good evaluation results as the previous face-to-face course. In particular, the students positively emphasize the use of Kahoot! as an activating digital medium. Discussion: Through the use of the ICM and the gamified audience response system Kahoot!, students could be activated in meaningful ways. The resulting discussions about the patient case and teaching content of the quiz questions in the synchronous online course could be implemented just as well as in the classroom-based course of previous semesters. Conclusion: The application of the online ICM, along with the consideration of the ICAP Model, has led to the successful implementation of a digital course within the context of the increased difficulty surrounding the emergency remote teaching. Additionally, students' learning success has remained at a similar level as during traditional classroom-based courses of previous semesters.;"[Huber, Johanna; Witti, Matthias; Fischer, Martin R.; Tolks, Daniel] LMU Klinikum Munchen, Inst Didakt & Ausbildungsforsch Med, Ziemssenstr 1, D-80336 Munich, Germany; [Schunk, Michaela] LMU Klinikum Munchen, Klin & Poliklin Palliat Med, Munich, Germany; [Tolks, Daniel] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Zentrum Gesundheitswissensch, Luneburg, Germany";Huber, J (corresponding author), LMU Klinikum Munchen, Inst Didakt & Ausbildungsforsch Med, Ziemssenstr 1, D-80336 Munich, Germany.;johanna.huber@med.uni-muenchen.de;NA;Tolks, Daniel/0000-0001-8597-5189;NA;NA;NA;17;0;0;2;2;GERMAN MEDICAL SCIENCE-GMS;DUESSELDORF;UBIERSTRASSE 20, DUESSELDORF, 40223, GERMANY;2366-5017;NA;NA;GMS J MED EDU;GMS J.

These activities are more noticeable in Engineering, in areas such as cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence, etc. Additionally, these activities acquire even more relevance with a distance education methodology, as our case is. The inclusion of these practical activities has clear advantages, such as (1) promoting critical thinking and (2) improving students' abilities and skills for their professional careers. There are several options, such as the use of remote and virtual laboratories, virtual reality and game-based platforms, among others. This work addresses the development of a new cloud game-based educational platform, which defines a modular and flexible architecture (using light containers). This architecture provides interactive and monitoring services and data storage in a transparent way. The platform uses gamification to integrate the game as part of the instructional process. The CyberScratch project is a particular implementation of this architecture focused on cybersecurity game-based activities. The data privacy management is a critical issue for these kinds of platforms, so the architecture is designed with this feature integrated in the platform components. To achieve this goal, we first focus on all the privacy aspects for the data generated by our cloud game-based platform, by considering the European legal context for data privacy following GDPR and ISO/IEC TR 20748-1:2016 recommendations for Learning Analytics (LA). Our second objective is to provide implementation guidelines for efficient data privacy management for our cloud game-based educative platform. All these contributions are not found in current related works. The CyberScratch project, which was approved by UNED for the year 2020, considers using the xAPI standard for data handling and services for the game editor, game engine and game monitor modules of CyberScratch. Therefore, apart from considering GDPR privacy and LA recommendations, our cloud game-based architecture covers all phases from game creation to the final users' interactions with the game.;"[Tobarra, Llanos; Utrilla, Alejandro; Robles-Gomez, Antonio; Pastor-Vargas, Rafael; Hernandez, Roberto] Spanish Natl Univ Distance Educ UNED, Comp Sci Engn Fac, Dept Control & Commun Syst, Madrid 28040, Spain";Tobarra, L (corresponding author), Spanish Natl Univ Distance Educ UNED, Comp Sci Engn Fac, Dept Control & Commun Syst, Madrid 28040, Spain.;"llanos@scc.uned.es; autrilla14@alumno.uned.es; arobles@scc.uned.es; rpastor@scc.uned.es; roberto@scc.uned.es";"Pastor Vargas, Rafael/D-9033-2013; Tobarra, Llanos/E-5122-2015; Robles-Gomez, Antonio/D-5589-2015";"Pastor Vargas, Rafael/0000-0002-4089-9538; Tobarra, Llanos/0000-0003-2779-4042; Robles-Gomez, Antonio/0000-0002-5181-0199";Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED);This work is a part of the CiberScratch PID project for the year 2020, and it is funded by the Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED).;NA;56;0;0;5;5;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2076-3417;NA;APPL SCI-BASEL;Appl.

This knowledge is tested annually with the American Board for Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) exam and is used to evaluate several aspects of a resident. We hypothesized that using a jeopardy game in educational conference would encourage residents to engage in self-learning and improve ABSITE scores at a single institution. Materials and methods: At a single institution, during protected education conference, residents played an hour-long surgical jeopardy game every 7 wk to summarize high yield topics discussed during the previous 6 wk of didactic learning. A 5-point Likert survey was completed by general surgery residents to discern the utility of the game format for learning. The ABSITE category scores were also evaluated from the year before and the year after the game was implemented. Results: Twenty-four general surgery residents took the survey with >80% agreeing that the jeopardy format was either a fun or an effective way to learn general surgery topics. Additionally, over 80% of residents thought the game format helped with retention of knowledge. ABSITE categories that had a jeopardy session improved from 65.9% to 70.4% correct (P = 0.0003). ABSITE categories that did not have dedicated jeopardy had a nonsignificant increase in scores (67.7%-69.9%, P = 0.1). Conclusions: Implementing surgical jeopardy as a component of educational conferences in general surgery resident training is correlated with improvement of ABSITE scores. Surgical jeopardy may be easily adopted and implemented to stimulate self-directed learning for residents. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;"[Hancock, Kevin J.; Klimberg, V.

On the other hand, there are different challenges that gamification faces: integrating the elements of the game into learning and not in isolation, combining formative evaluation within didactic approaches, preventing it from falling into maximum simplification and converting it only in the delivery of badges, points or levels, or clarify the terminology that exists around. All this nebula that accompanies gamification in the educational field, causes that erroneous beliefs about it are being established.

In this sense, the article presented here shows an analytical study that was developed under an exploratory, descriptive, interpretative methodology of the categories augmented reality, gamification, and m-learning, based on a characterization in the databases, carried out an exploratory review in the main databases such as ScienceDirect, Scopus and web Science, obtaining 100 reference articles. In this way, it was found that these three categories determined as teaching strategies significantly influence motivation, interest in knowledge, retention and understanding of information for the development of teaching-learning processes.

However, gamified reading is new, and there is little empirical evidence regarding its effectiveness. The sustainability of the effects of gamification pedagogy is also in doubt as some scholars think that such effects are short-term and not sustainable. This paper presents the results of three sub-studies of examining the effects of an online gamified reading platform and the sustainability of these effects. Study 1 examined the change in students' academic performance between two groups divided based on their different participation levels. Study 2 addressed the question of how students/parents/teachers perceive students' motivation and gaining in the use of the gamified platform. Study 3 explored the sustainability of the effects of the gamified platform from a longitudinal perspective. Findings suggest that students' deep engagement in the gamified e-learning platform can help increase their reading motivation and improve their reading abilities. Such effects can be sustained for several semesters. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Reading is very important for children's development. However, the ubiquity of digital entertainment (eg, digital games & online videos) occupies children's attention and energy, resulting in a decline in children's reading motivation. At present, gamification has been widely used in e-learning to increase learners' learning motivation and engagement. Few studies have focused on children's gamified reading supported by sufficient empirical evidence. What this paper adds This study proposes a gamification pedagogy with a gamified reading platform to facilitate primary students' reading motivation and competence. This study uses a mixed-method approach to examine the effects of the proposed gamification pedagogy on students' reading interest, motivation, habits and abilities. This study explores the sustainability of the gamified platform effects and fills the research gap regarding the sustainability of gamification pedagogy. Implications for practice and/or policy Active users of the gamified reading platform benefit from it in reading interest, motivation, habits, and abilities. The effects of gamification pedagogy can be sustainable when users' intrinsic learning motivation is aroused.;"[Li, Xiuhan] Cent China Normal Univ, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Chu, Samuel Kai Wah] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China";"Li, XH (corresponding author), Cent China Normal Univ, Wuhan, Peoples R China.; Li, XH (corresponding author), Cent China Normal Univ, Fac Artificial Intelligence Educ, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.";xiuhanli@126.com;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;40;2;2;31;31;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0007-1013;1467-8535;NA;BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL;Br.

Serious Games (SGs) are a tool with an immensely positive impact and great success. SGs enable learning and provide entertainment and self-empowerment, which motivates students. The development of an SG consists of complex processes requiring multi-disciplinary knowledge in multiple domains, including knowing the learning domain and adding the appropriate game mechanics to foster high intrinsic motivation and positive player experience that makes the players feel like they are having fun while learning. Otherwise, the game is viewed as boring and not as a fun and engaging activity. Nevertheless, despite their potential, the application of SGs in education has been limited in terms of pedagogy. Several authors assert that this lack is because SG standards and guidelines have not been developed. There is an imbalance between experts' contributions to education and game design specialists for the SG development. Not all the SGs that have been developed have applied appropriate design methodologies that incorporate both the entertainment mechanics and the serious component. To ensure that an SG meets the user's expectations, it must be designed using an appropriate method. This work aims to present iPlus, a methodology for designing SGs based on a participatory, flexible, and user-centered approach. Additionally, this paper analyses several case studies with the iPlus methodology.;"[Carrion-Toro, Mayra; Santorum, Marco; Perez, Maria] Escuela Politec Nacl, Dept Informat & Comp Sci, Quito 170525, Ecuador; [Acosta-Vargas, Patricia] Univ Amer, Intelligent & Interact Syst Lab, Quito 170125, Ecuador; [Aguilar, Jose] Univ Los Andes, Ctr Estudios Microelect & Sistemas Distribuidos, Merida 5101, Venezuela; [Aguilar, Jose] Univ EAFIT, GIDITIC, Medellin 050022, Colombia";Acosta-Vargas, P (corresponding author), Univ Amer, Intelligent & Interact Syst Lab, Quito 170125, Ecuador.;"mayra.carrion@epn.edu.ec; marco.santorum@epn.edu.ec; patricia.acosta@udla.edu.ec; aguilar@ula.ve; maria.perez@epn.edu.ec";"; Acosta-Vargas, Patricia/J-9708-2017; Aguilar, Jose/H-3017-2015";"Santorum, Marco/0000-0001-7251-923X; Acosta-Vargas, Patricia/0000-0003-4210-0117; Aguilar, Jose/0000-0003-4194-6882";"Secretariat for Higher Education, Science, Technology, and Innovation through the National research financing program (INEDITA) [20190003CI, PIC-18-INE-EPN-003]; Universidad de Las Americas-Ecuador";This work has been funded by Secretariat for Higher Education, Science, Technology, and Innovation through the National research financing program (INEDITA), under the Convention No.: 20190003CI and project code: PIC-18-INE-EPN-003 and Universidad de Las Americas-Ecuador.;NA;96;0;0;1;1;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2076-3417;NA;APPL SCI-BASEL;Appl.

Lessons cannot be envisaged without the use of tools such as computers, tablets or mobile devices. Many lecturers use audience response systems (ARS) to keep their classes engaged. ARS software allows teachers to interact with students via polls, text responses, or multiple-choice questions displayed via their mobile devices. A new example of the use of this type of devices in education is gamification, a technique that uses a set of activities with ludic character as a learning methodology in order to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge and competences. One of the most used gamification tools is Kahoot!, a free learning application based on a mixture of game and creativity, which encourages attention and participation of students through questions and answers formulated by the teacher and designed in a way that students respond via their mobile phones. This paper examines the use of Kahoot! in a subject belonging to the chemistry area. In order to assess the benefits of this tool, it was tested in a group of students to review the knowledge and skills acquired during the theoretical lessons prior to the exams, and the academic results were compared with those of a control group of students who did not use the tool. The results demonstrate that the use of Kahoot! led to an improvement in the teaching-learning process of the students and a noteworthy rise in their marks, and that its positive effects rise with increasing the frequency of use of this didactic tool.;"[Diez-Pascual, Ana Maria] Alcala Univ, Dept Analyt Chem Phys Chem & Chem Engn, Fac Sci, Madrid 28871, Spain; [Diaz, Maria Pilar Garcia] Alcala Univ, Dept Signal Theory & Commun, Polytech High Sch, Madrid 28871, Spain";Diez-Pascual, AM (corresponding author), Alcala Univ, Dept Analyt Chem Phys Chem & Chem Engn, Fac Sci, Madrid 28871, Spain.;"am.diez@uah.es; pilar.garcia@uah.es";NA;"Pilar, Garcia Diaz/0000-0002-5361-6947; Diez Pascual, Ana Maria/0000-0001-7405-2354";NA;NA;NA;29;0;0;4;4;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2227-7102;NA;EDUC SCI;Educ.

In particular, several investigations have highlighted the effectiveness of student response systems, or clickers, in different subjects and disciplines. Although some literature reviews have been published on this subject, none of them offer a review of a large volume of publications from a multidisciplinary approach. Similarly, in the literature there are no studies that have analyzed scientific collaborations on this subject. To respond to these concerns, we proposed the use of a bot to retrieve information from a large number of papers (1696 documents co-authored by a total of 4091 researchers) included in the Scopus database. The disciplines covered include natural sciences, engineering and technology, medical and health sciences, agricultural and veterinary sciences, social sciences and humanities, and the arts. The review of the literature reveals that student response systems are generally well-perceived by teachers and students in all the disciplines. Another interesting result achieved from visual data obtained using network visualization software and word clouds is that student response systems are mainly used in some disciplines, such as physics, chemistry, medicine, and nursing. It is clearly observed that the relationship between researchers from the same country is stronger than between researchers from different countries. Finally, some reflections are included on the role of student response systems in online teaching, especially regarding the changes experienced after the COVID-19 pandemic.;"[Herrada, Rosario I.] Univ Almeria, Dept Educ, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Banos, Raul; Alcayde, Alfredo] Univ Almeria, Dept Engn, Almeria 04120, Spain";Banos, R (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Dept Engn, Almeria 04120, Spain.;"rherrada@ual.es; rbanos@ual.es; aalcayde@ual.es";"Garcia, Alfredo Alcayde/R-8627-2018; BANOS, RAUL/D-6433-2013";"Garcia, Alfredo Alcayde/0000-0002-2776-089X; BANOS, RAUL/0000-0001-7844-4902";"University of Almeria through innovation and good teaching practice projects; project zQuizUALbot [19_20_1_15C]";The authors wish to thank the support given by the University of Almeria for its support through innovation and good teaching practice projects, including the project zQuizUALbot (19_20_1_15C).;NA;140;0;0;8;8;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2227-7102;NA;EDUC SCI;Educ.

This drone programming course is open-access and ready-to-use for any teacher/student to teach/learn drone programming with it for free. The students may program diverse drones on their computers without a physical presence in this course. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) applications are essentially practical, as their intelligence resides in the software part. Therefore, the proposed course emphasizes drone programming through practical learning. It comprises a collection of exercises resembling drone applications in real life, such as following a road, visual landing, and people search and rescue, including their corresponding background theory. The course has been successfully taught for five years to students from several university engineering degrees. Some exercises from the course have also been validated in three aerial robotics competitions, including an international one. RoboticsAcademy is also briefly presented in the paper. It is an open framework for distance robotics learning in engineering degrees. It has been designed as a practical complement to the typical online videos of massive open online courses (MOOCs). Its educational contents are built upon robot operating system (ROS) middleware (de facto standard in robot programming), the powerful 3D Gazebo simulator, and the widely used Python programming language. Additionally, RoboticsAcademy is a suitable tool for gamified learning and online robotics competitions, as it includes several competitive exercises and automatic assessment tools.;"[Canas, Jose M.; Vega, Julio; Roldan-Alvarez, David; Fernandez-Conde, Jesus] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Telemat Syst & Computat, Madrid 28942, Spain; [Martin-Martin, Diego] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Elect Technol Area, Madrid 28933, Spain; [Arias, Pedro] JdeRobot Org, Madrid 28922, Spain; [Garcia-Perez, Lia] Francisco de Vitoria Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Madrid 28223, Spain";Canas, JM (corresponding author), Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Telemat Syst & Computat, Madrid 28942, Spain.;"josemaria.plaza@urjc.es; diego.martin.martin@urjc.es; pedroariasperez96@gmail.com; julio.vega@urjc.es; david.roldan@urjc.es; lia.garcia@ufv.es; jesus.fernandez@urjc.es";"Martin, Diego Martin/I-2867-2015; Fernandez-Conde, Jesus/C-5458-2014; Martin, Diego Martin/M-5095-2019";"Martin, Diego Martin/0000-0001-5631-3370; Fernandez-Conde, Jesus/0000-0001-7197-6789; Martin, Diego Martin/0000-0001-5631-3370";Community of MadridComunidad de Madrid [F664, S2018/NMT-4331];This research was partially funded by the Community of Madrid in the framework of two research projects: (1) Multiannual agreement with Rey Juan Carlos University in line of action 1, Encouragement of Young Ph.D. Students Investigation project ref.

This paper presents an analysis of the meanings of ICT-mediated assessment, establishing what kinds of knowledge are suitable for this type of evaluation, and the challenges and possibilities of virtual tools. For this, we present a systematic review of ICT-mediated evaluation and assessment according to the educational paradigms and their implementation. We highlight that contemporary pedagogical models and their implementation in ICT mediation tools show a trend towards quantitative and summative valuation. The commonly used learning management systems (LMS) include several types of questions oriented to quantitative evaluation, with multiple-choice being the most common. However, new technological approaches like gamification, virtual reality and mobile learning open new assessment possibilities.

The aim of this review was to assess the effect of games on the blood glucose level (glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)). A systematic review and meta-analysis were made. Pubmed, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were consulted in July of 2020. Ten studies were selected as a final sample, most of them being clinical trials using games to improve diabetes control. Half of the studies had samples between 8 and 14.9 years old and the other half between 57 and 65 years old. The studies informed about using applications/games for mobile phones, game consoles, and board games for diabetes education and management. The meta-analysis was performed with 4 studies showing a mean difference of 0.12 (CI 95% 0.57, 0.33) of HbA1c in favor of the intervention group with p > 0.05. Games are positive for diabetes health education and promoting healthier lifestyle, but their impact on HbA1c is low.;"[Martos-Cabrera, Maria Begona] San Cecilio Clin Univ Hosp, Andalusian Hlth Serv, Ave Conocimiento S-N, Granada 18016, Spain; [Membrive-Jimenez, Maria Jose] Ceuta Univ Hosp, Natl Inst Hlth Management, Loma Colmenar S-N, Ceuta 51003, Spain; [Suleiman-Martos, Nora] Univ Granada, Fac Hlth Sci, Ceuta Univ Campus,C Cortadura Valle SN, Ceuta 51001, Spain; [Mota-Romero, Emilio] Andalusian Hlth Serv, Granada Metropolitano Hlth Dist, Assitance Unit Doctores Dr Salvador Caballero Gar, C Joaquina Eguaras,2,Edificio 2,1a Planta, Granada 18013, Spain; [De la Fuente, Guillermo Arturo; Gomez-Urquiza, Jose L.] Univ Granada, Fac Hlth Sci, Ave Ilustrac 60, Granada 18016, Spain; [Albendin-Garcia, Luis] Andalusian Hlth Serv, Granada Metropolitano Hlth Dist, Assitance Unit La Chana, C Joaquina Eguaras,2,Edificio 2,1a Planta, Granada 18013, Spain";Gomez-Urquiza, JL (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Fac Hlth Sci, Ave Ilustrac 60, Granada 18016, Spain.;"mbmartos@ujaen.es; mariajosemembrive@correo.ugr.es; norasm@ugr.es; emilio.mota.sspa@juntadeandalucia.es; gacf@ugr.es; jlgurquiza@ugr.es; lualbgar1979@ugr.es";"Membrive-Jimenez, Maria Jose/ABG-8146-2020; Albendin, Luis/K-9744-2017; Suleiman-Martos, Nora/AAK-6666-2020; la Fuente, Guillermo A.

In this article, an approach based on the divide-and-conquer methodology is proposed to facilitate its learning. The proposed strategy is designed to sequentially explain and evaluate the different concepts involved in hypothesis testing, ensuring that a new concept is not presented until the previous one has been fully assimilated. The proposed approach, which contains several gamification elements (i.e., points or a leader-board), is implemented into an application via a modern game engine. The usefulness of the proposed approach was assessed in an experiment in which 89 first-year students enrolled in the Statistics course within the Industrial Engineering degree participated. Based on the results of a test aimed at evaluating the acquired knowledge, it was observed that students who used the developed application based on the proposed approach obtained statistically significant higher scores than those that attended a traditional class (p-value < 0.001), regardless of whether they used the learning tool before or after the traditional class. In addition, the responses provided by the students who participated in the study to a test of satisfaction showed their high satisfaction with the application and their interest in the promotion of these tools.

The design of the study utilized a descriptive perspective and a cross-sectional quantitative focus through a quantitative exploratory study. For data collection, an ad hoc questionnaire was utilized, which was administered to a sample of 232 teachers-in-training. The main result obtained was that the future early childhood education professionals considered that gamification could be a resource for the learning of specific mathematics contents, and this was shaped around a model of two elements. On one hand, the development of mathematical thinking, and on the other, the establishment of relationships between mathematical concepts. Lastly, we can conclude that elements such as age or gender do not determine the perception of the use of gamification in the early childhood education classroom.;"[Marin-Diaz, Veronica; Sampedro-Requena, Begona E.; Munoz-Gonzalez, Juan M.] Univ Cordoba, Fac Educ, Dept Educ, Cordoba 14004, Spain; [Jimenez-Fanjul, Noelia N.] Univ Cordoba, Fac Educ, Dept Math, Cordoba 14004, Spain";Marin-Diaz, V (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Fac Educ, Dept Educ, Cordoba 14004, Spain.;"vmarin@uco.es; bsampedro@uco.es; juan.manuel@uco.es; noelia.jimenez@uco.es";"; Munoz Gonzalez, Juan Manuel/K-3646-2014; Marin-Diaz, Veronica/G-2730-2013";"Jimenez Fanjul, Noelia Noemi/0000-0002-5728-8725; Munoz Gonzalez, Juan Manuel/0000-0001-9332-0465; Marin-Diaz, Veronica/0000-0001-9836-2584";NA;NA;NA;50;1;1;4;4;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2227-7390;NA;MATHEMATICS-BASEL;Mathematics;DEC;2020;8;12;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2215;10.3390/math8122215;NA;NA;15;Mathematics;Mathematics;PJ7ZO;WOS:000601980800001;NA;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

As other basic engineering subjects, it needs an active participation of the students in the learning process. However, nowadays, one of the main difficult to teach this kind of disciplines is to keep the student's motivation and participation in the learning process. For this reason, the use of new tools, as the educational gamification, can help to change the way to understand and teach this subject (Ballesteros et al., 2019). In this context, the application of game-based activities to engineering education has increased in popularity among students (Blumenfeld et al., 1991). In this work, we present the application of a escape room-based to heat transfer interactive evaluation for third year chemical engineering students. The plot of our escape lab-room is focused on a crazy scientific (Dr. Nusselito Graetzoff) that is obsessed with the heat transfer. He has retained a group of scientists and has the code for a missile launch. It is a national security case! The students (distributed by groups) play the role of heat transfer specialists from different Research Centers, which have to complete two missions: release the imprisoned scientists, and avoid the missile launch planned by Dr. Nusselito. Therefore, the students have to solve different questions/cases related to heat transfer issues, obtaining the codes that will allow them to complete their mission. The plot of the activity is conducted by using videos, in which the different parts of the activity are described. In addition, the professors supervise and help the correct progress of the escape room. We used the same kind of theoretical and applied problems in both evaluation methods, traditional exam and escape room one. After this experience, we can confirm the increase of student participation regarding to previous years. In addition, the students showed enthusiastic attitude (Fig. 1a) and a high satisfaction level. Therefore, the students' participation of escape lab-room, to heat transfer teaching was completely successful, although this activity only accounts for a 10 % of the total course score.

However, the application of game design in the participatory modeling context remains fragmented and mostly limited to user-friendly interfaces, storytelling, and visualization for better representation of the simulation models. This paper suggests possible extensions of game design use for each stage of the participatory modeling process, aiming at better learning, communication among stakeholders, and overall engagement. The proposed extensions are based on the effects that different types of game-like applications bring to the aspects of social learning and the contribution of gamification to engagement, motivation, and enjoyment of some activities. We conclude that serious games and gamification have a high potential for improving the quality of the participatory modeling process, while also highlighting additional research that is needed for designing particular practical gamified applications in this context.;"[Bakhanova, Elena; Garcia, Jaime A.; Raffe, William L.; Voinov, Alexey] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Ctr Persuas Syst Wise Adapt Living, Sch Informat Syst & Modelling, 15 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Garcia, Jaime A.; Raffe, William L.] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Sch Comp Sci, UTS Games Studio, 15 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Voinov, Alexey] Univ Twente, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands";Bakhanova, E (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Ctr Persuas Syst Wise Adapt Living, Sch Informat Syst & Modelling, 15 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.;elena.bakhanova@uts.edu.au;NA;"Garcia, Jaime/0000-0001-5718-1605; Raffe, William/0000-0001-5310-0943; Bakhanova, Elena/0000-0002-5704-961X; Voinov, Alexey/0000-0002-2985-4574";Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney;This work is part of Ph.D. research supported by funding from the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney.;NA;119;1;1;12;12;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;1364-8152;1873-6726;NA;ENVIRON MODELL SOFTW;Environ.

Three data sources enhanced the methodological triangulation: observations and scores from testing, surveys of students' perceptions, and focus group discussions with a stratified random sample of students (n = 25). Findings suggest students became immersed in the gamified reading assessment and were motivated by tasks that were challenging but not frustratingly difficult. However, they were dissatisfied with some design features and reported focusing on identifying patterns and gaming strategies rather than on the reading skills being assessed. This suggests students' expectations of gamified assessments might contribute construct irrelevant variance to the instruments.;"[Reed, Deborah K.; Martin, Emily] Univ Iowa, Iowa Reading Res Ctr, 103 Lindquist Ctr, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Hazeltine, Eliot; McMurray, Bob] Univ Iowa, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Iowa City, IA USA";Reed, DK (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Iowa Reading Res Ctr, 103 Lindquist Ctr, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.;deborah-reed@uiowa.edu;NA;Reed, Deborah/0000-0003-0874-1412;NA;NA;NA;46;1;1;10;10;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0162-6434;2381-3121;NA;J SPEC EDUC TECHNOL;J.

However, while the research on the effectiveness of gamification in the context of education has been growing, there are blind spots regarding which types of gamification may be suitable for different educational contexts. This study investigates the effects of the challenge-based gamification on learning in the area of statistics education. We developed a gamification approach, called Horses for Courses, which is composed of main game design patterns related to the challenge-based gamification; points, levels, challenges and a leaderboard. Having conducted a 2 (read: yes vs. no) x 2 (gamification: yes vs. no) between-subject experiment, we present a quantitative analysis of the performance of 365 students from two different academic majors: Electrical and Computer Engineering (n=279), and Business Administration (n=86). The results of our experiments show that the challenge-based gamification had a positive impact on student learning compared to traditional teaching methods (compared to having no treatment and treatment involving reading exercises).

However, a canonical dearth in research and application of gamification has been related to the role of individual differences in susceptibility to gamification and its varied designs. To address this gap, this study reviews the extant corpus of research on tailored gamification (42 studies). The findings of the review indicate that most studies on the field are mostly focused on user modeling for a future personalization, adaptation, or recommendation of game elements. This user model usually contains the users' preferences of play (i.e., player types), and is mostly applied in educational settings. The main contributions of this paper are a standardized terminology of the game elements used in tailored gamification, the discussion on the most suitable game elements for each users' characteristic, and a research agenda including dynamic modeling, exploring multiple characteristics simultaneously, and understanding the effects of other aspects of the interaction on user experience.;"[Tome Klock, Ana Carolina; Hamari, Juho] Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun Sci, Gamificat Grp, Tampere, Finland; [Tome Klock, Ana Carolina; Pimenta, Marcelo Soares] Fed Univ Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS, Inst Informat, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Gasparini, Isabela] Santa Catarina State Univ UDESC, Dept Comp Sci, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil";"Klock, ACT (corresponding author), Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun Sci, Gamificat Grp, Tampere, Finland.; Klock, ACT (corresponding author), Fed Univ Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS, Inst Informat, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.";"actklock@inf.ufrgs.br; isabela.gasparini@udesc.br; mpimenta@inf.ufrgs.br; juho.hamari@tuni.fi";"Klock, Ana Carolina Tome/AAV-2165-2020; Hamari, Juho/E-4989-2016";"Klock, Ana Carolina Tome/0000-0003-3774-6511; Hamari, Juho/0000-0002-6573-588X";"CNPq -National Council for Scientific and Technological DevelopmentNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES)CAPES [001]; FAPESC [06/2016, 2017TR1755]";"I am grateful for the financial support of CNPq -National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, and of the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES) -Finance Code 001.; I would like to thank the partial financial support of FAPESC, public call FAPESC/CNPq No. 06/2016 support the infrastructure of CTI for young researchers, project T.O.

This exploratory study is focused on a particular part of corporate applications - using gamification to empower knowledge workers and to help them to interact with each other. Based on a review of the extant literature and an exploratory case study, we conceptualise different ways in which gamification supports knowledge workers and influences the dynamics of their interactions. The case study we present is that of online retailer Zappos who have been pioneers in this field. This paper is intended as the beginning of a journey towards utilising gamification in various aspects of knowledge work. Through studying the Zappos case, we draw out key learning points that can be used by other organisations in their journey to use gamification to empower knowledge workers. The paper also identifies areas for further research relevant to expert and intelligent systems, including the potential for synergies between gamification and intelligent systems, and the use of gamification in intelligent systems implementation.

Gamified instruction is touted as a motivational alternative for learning that increases learner autonomy, but research is lacking into its educational merit beyond those claims. This study measured the extent to which a gamified English as a foreign language classroom adhered to 21 principles of good education proposed by Mind, Brain, and Education (MBE) researchers in comparison to a traditional classroom. It also explored the claim that gamification promotes greater learner autonomy. Two sections of a college English class in Ecuador were used in this study. One was gamified and the other used a traditional education model. Both groups completed a 22 Likert Scale item questionnaire which correlated questions with each MBE principle and one question about perceived autonomy. The teacher and the students also provided comments about the experience. The data showed that the gamified group had higher rankings of perceived adherence to all of the 21 principles and a statement about autonomy with 14 of them being significantly higher. The qualitative data also supported the greater perceived adherence to MBE principles and an increase in perceived autonomy amongst students from the gamified group. It was concluded that gamified instruction did provide a learning environment that adhered more closely to proposals made by MBE researchers for good education and did create an atmosphere where students felt greater control of their learning.;"[Rueckert, Daniel] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Modern Languages & Literature, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA; [Pico, Karina] North Orange Cty Continuing Educ, ESL Dept, Anaheim, CA USA; [Kim, Daesang] Valdosta State Univ, Dept Leadership Technol & Workforce Dev, Valdosta, GA USA; [Calero Sanchez, Ximena] Univ Tecn Ambato, Dept Ciencias Humanas & Educ, Ambato, Ecuador";Rueckert, D (corresponding author), 800N State Coll Blvd, Fullerton, CA 92831 USA.;drueckert@fullerton.edu;NA;Rueckert, Daniel/0000-0002-9721-3146;NA;NA;NA;29;0;0;18;18;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0015-718X;1944-9720;NA;FOREIGN LANG ANN;Foreign Lang.

Inadequate geological knowledge affects not only university students but also the majority of citizens who finish their secondary studies without having learned any basic geological concepts. The insufficient geological training of pre-university teachers who are later expected to teach some geology generates a certain degree of insecurity and fear about teaching geology. Therefore, it is imperative to improve training for trainee teachers to replace usual ways of thinking about geology teaching with new approaches that promote significant geological learning. This research has a dual objective: first, we analyze whether trainee teachers' theses include geoscience content; second, we explore how innovative ideas and practices can be translated for educational purposes and to promote geologically significant learning. Our findings reveal that environmental impacts, plate tectonics and the hydrosphere are concurrent topics in the geosciences. However, trainee teachers in Spain prefer to develop biology units because many of them have training in bioscience fields of knowledge. Traditional education based on the exposition of learning material by the teacher was identified as the main learning environment developed in the trainee teachers' theses. However, the number of innovations incorporated into trainee teachers' theses has increased. Through this process, trainee teachers have a critical role to play: encouraging their future secondary students to develop geology knowledge.";"[Roca, Nuria] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Evolut Ecol & Ciencies Ambientals, GI GRIMS Grp, Av Diagonal 643, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Garcia-Valles, Maite] Univ Barcelona, Fac Ciencies Terra, Dept Mineral Petr & Geol Aplicada, GI GRIMS Grp, Carrer Marti i Franques S-N, Barcelona 08028, Spain";Roca, N (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Evolut Ecol & Ciencies Ambientals, GI GRIMS Grp, Av Diagonal 643, Barcelona 08028, Spain.;nroca@ub.edu;Garcia-Valles, Maite/L-5696-2014;Garcia-Valles, Maite/0000-0003-1117-1705;NA;NA;NA;58;1;1;1;1;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1867-2477;1867-2485;NA;GEOHERITAGE;Geoheritage;nov/16;2020;12;4;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;92;10.1007/s12371-020-00518-8;NA;NA;15;Geosciences, Multidisciplinary;Geology;OY8BY;WOS:000594467700002;NA;Bronze;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

The use of immersive virtual reality offers exciting, yet largely unexplored solutions to this problem. Taking neuroanatomy as an example of a visually and spatially complex subject, the present study investigated whether academic learning using a state-of-the-art Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) yielded higher learning gains compared to conventional textbooks. The present study leveraged a combination of CAVE benefits including collaborative learning, rich spatial information, embodied interaction and gamification. Results indicated significantly higher learning gains after collaborative learning in the CAVE with large effect sizes compared to a textbook condition. Furthermore, low spatial ability learners benefitted most from the strong spatial cues provided by immersive virtual reality, effectively raising their performance to that of high spatial ability learners. The present study serves as a concrete example of the effective design and implementation of virtual reality in CAVE settings, demonstrating learning gains and thus opening opportunities to more pervasive use of immersive technologies for education. In addition, the study illustrates how immersive learning may provide novel scaffolds to increase performance in those who need it most.;"[de Back, Tycho T.; Tinga, Angelica M.; Nguyen, Phong; Louwerse, Max M.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Cognit Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Dante Bldg,Warandelaan 2, NL-5037 AB Tilburg, Netherlands";de Back, TT (corresponding author), Tilburg Univ, Dept Cognit Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Dante Bldg,Warandelaan 2, NL-5037 AB Tilburg, Netherlands.;t.t.deback@uvt.nl;NA;de Back, Tycho/0000-0002-2667-608X;"PACCAR foundation; DAF Trucks; European UnionEuropean Commission; Ministry of Economic Affairs; Province of Noord-Brabant; municipality of Tilburg [PROJ-00076]; municipality of Gilze Rijen [PROJ-00076]";The current research is partially funded by the PACCAR foundation and DAF Trucks and on a grant by the European Union, Operational Program Zuid, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Province of Noord-Brabant and the municipalities of Tilburg and Gilze Rijen awarded to ML (PROJ-00076).

Objective: The aim of this study was to conceptualize a theory-based and evidence-based mHealth intervention called SMARTFAMILY (SF) that targets physical activity and healthy eating in a collective family-based setting. Subsequently, the app will be refined and re-evaluated to analyze additional effects of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) and gamification features. Methods: A smartphone app based on behavior change theories and behavior change techniques was developed and implemented and will be evaluated with family members individually and cooperatively (SF trial). Existing evidence and gained results were used to refine and will be used to re-evaluate the app (SF2.0 trial). Both trials are cluster randomized controlled trials with 3 measurement occasions. The intervention group uses the app for 3 consecutive weeks, whereas the control group receives no treatment. Baseline measurements (T-0) and postintervention measurements (T-1) include physical activity (ie, self-reported and accelerometly) and healthy eating measurements (ie, self-reported fruit and vegetable intake) as the primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes (ie, self-reported) are intrinsic motivation, behavior-specific self-efficacy, and the family health climate, complemented by an intentional measure in SF2.0. Four weeks following T-1, a follow-up assessment (T-2) is completed by the participants, consisting of all questionnaire items to assess the stability of the intervention effects. Mixed-method analysis of covariance will be used to calculate the primary intervention effects (ie, physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake) while controlling for covariates, including family health climate, behavior-specific self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation. Results: This study is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and ethically approved by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. For both trials, it is hypothesized that the apps will positively influence physical activity and healthy eating in the whole family. Furthermore, SF2.0 is expected to produce stronger effects (ie, higher effect sizes) compared to SF. SF app development and piloting are completed. Data acquisition for the SF trial is terminated and discontinued due to the COVID-19 pandemic. SF2.0 app development and piloting are completed, while data acquisition is ongoing. Participant recruitment for the SF 2.0 trial started in February 2020. The results for SF are expected to be published in mid-2021, and the results of SF2.0 are expected to be published in mid-2022. Conclusions: In this study, it is hypothesized that targeting the whole family will facilitate behavior change at the individual level and the family level, as the implemented strategies address changes in daily family life. Furthermore, subsequent app development (SF2.0) with supplementary addition of motivation-enhancing features and a JITAI approach is expected to enhance positive intervention effects.;"[Wunsch, Kathrin; Eckert, Tobias; Fiedler, Janis; Cleven, Laura; Woll, Alexander] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Sports & Sports Sci, Engler Bunte Ring 15, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Niermann, Christina] Univ Konstanz, Dept Sports Sci, Constance, Germany; [Reiterer, Harald] Univ Konstanz, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Constance, Germany; [Renner, Britta] Univ Konstanz, Dept Psychol, Constance, Germany";Wunsch, K (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Sports & Sports Sci, Engler Bunte Ring 15, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.;kathrin.wunsch@kit.edu;Wunsch, Kathrin/AAL-2850-2021;"Wunsch, Kathrin/0000-0001-9400-4130; Niermann, Christina/0000-0002-2087-5328; Cleven, Laura/0000-0001-8213-9417; Fiedler, Janis/0000-0002-9291-2191; Eckert, Tobias/0000-0002-0565-7998";Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the project SMARTACT [FKZ 01EL1820A];This research was supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research Grant FKZ 01EL1820A within the project SMARTACT.;NA;92;0;0;10;10;JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC;TORONTO;130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA;1929-0748;NA;NA;JMIR RES PROTOC;JMIR RES.

Some e-learning media that are generally used based on survey results include 53.81% google classrooms combined with other applications that are not integrated with the institution's Learning Management System. This condition provides research opportunities to evaluate the effectiveness of online learning, especially how students are motivated to learn the method, where the results can be used as a reference in developing and refining the method. Based on many studies, that the gamification model can increase individual motivation in carrying out activities, this study uses a gamification octalysis framework to analyze the extent of the role of gamification in the learning process and measure the amount of student motivation in online learning activities. The evaluation results show that the conclusion of the Likert scale results in a High level, while the highest score is Very High. As for the octalysis test scale, the average score of 6.5 on a scale of 1 to 10. The conclusion from the results of this evaluation is that the motivation to learn e-learning during the Covid-19 period is quite high and has the potential to be developed. While the results of the Octalysis framework with 8 core drives are still average, for that we need innovation in E-learning which aims to increase student motivation based on Octalysis's 8 core drives. The results of this study recommend that gamification is needed to increase student learning motivation in order to improve learning outcomes.;"[Marisa, Fitri] Widyagama Univ Malang, Fac Informat & Commun Technol, Dept Informat Engn, Malang, Indonesia; [Marisa, Fitri] Univ Tekn Malaysia Melaka, Melaka, Malaysia; [Ahmad, Sharifah Sakinah Syed; Yusoh, Zeratul Izzah Mohd] Univ Tekn Malaysia Melaka, Fac Informat & Commun Technol, Melaka, Malaysia; [Maukar, Anastasia L.] President Univ, Ind Engn Dept, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Marcus, Ronald David] Univ Merdeka Malang, Fac Informat Technol, Malang, Indonesia; [Widodo, Anang Aris] Merdeka Univ Pasuruan, Fac Informat Technol, Malang, Indonesia";"Marisa, F (corresponding author), Widyagama Univ Malang, Fac Informat & Commun Technol, Dept Informat Engn, Malang, Indonesia.; Marisa, F (corresponding author), Univ Tekn Malaysia Melaka, Melaka, Malaysia.";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;35;0;0;2;2;SCIENCE & INFORMATION SAI ORGANIZATION LTD;WEST YORKSHIRE;19 BOLLING RD, BRADFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE, 00000, ENGLAND;2158-107X;2156-5570;NA;INT J ADV COMPUT SC;Int.

For the education to be successful, classroom management must be considered, since problems may arise and handicap this process. In order to promote learning and reduce negative behaviors and increase positive ones, intervention on students of 1st year of ESO (compulsory secondary education) was implemented. The intervention used gamification as the educational approach and ClassDojo as the online tool to track behavior to determine the effectiveness of both elements to achieve the goal. Taking advantage of the game design principles and mechanics in the learning environment to create motivation and interest, in addition to the information and communication technologies (ICT) represented by ClassDojo, the experimental study showed the benefit of this method and app regarding the improvement of desired behaviors as well as the decrease of the disruptive ones.

Since nudging is a new concept, no review of literature on nudging diabetic patients into improving their health behaviour has been done. Therefore, we aim to collate a list of nudge intervention and determine the context in which nudging is successful. Methods. - We adopted a two-arm search strategy comprising the search of literature databases and snowballing using relevant search terms. We summarized patient characteristics, the nudge intervention, according to nudging strategies, delivery mode and their outcomes. The conditions present in effective nudge interventions were assessed and reported. Results. - We retrieved 11,494 studies from our searches and included 33. An additional five studies were added through snowballing. Studies included utilized framing (n = 5), reminders (n = 10), gamification (n = 2), social modelling (n = 5) and social influence (n = 16). Studies on reminders and gamification were more likely to have a statistically significant outcome. The targeted health behaviours identified were medication adherence, physical activity, diet, blood glucose monitoring, foot care, self-efficacy, HbA1c and quality of life. Of these, studies with adherence to medication, foot care practice and quality of life as targeted health behaviours were more likely to show a statistically significant outcome. Conclusion. - Nudging has shown potential in changing health behaviour of patients with diabetes in specific context. We identified two possible factors (delivery mode and patient characteristics) that may affect the effectiveness of nudge intervention. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Of the distinct techniques introduced in the literature to engage students, gamification, is likely the most widely explored and fruitful. Game elements that intrinsically motivate students, such as graphical feedback and game-thinking, reveal more reliable long-term positive effects, but those involve significant development effort. This paper proposes a game-based assessment environment for programming challenges, built on top of a specialized framework, in which students develop a program to control the player, henceforth called Software Agent (SA). During the coding phase, students can resort to the graphical feedback demonstrating how the game unfolds to improve their programs and complete the proposed tasks. This environment also promotes competition through competitive evaluation and tournaments among SAs, optionally organized at the end by the teacher. Moreover, the validation of the effectiveness of Asura in increasing undergraduate students' motivation and, consequently, the practice of programming is reported.;"[Paiva, Jose Carlos; Leal, Jose Paulo; Queiros, Ricardo] Inst Syst & Comp INESC Porto LA, Ctr Res Adv Comp Syst CRACS, P-4169007 Porto, Portugal; [Paiva, Jose Carlos; Leal, Jose Paulo] Univ Porto, Dept Comp Sci, Fac Sci, P-4169007 Porto, Portugal; [Queiros, Ricardo] Polytech Porto, Unidade Invest Media Artes & Design UniMAD, Escola Super Media Artes & Design ESMAD, P-4480876 Vila Do Conde, Portugal";"Paiva, JC (corresponding author), Inst Syst & Comp INESC Porto LA, Ctr Res Adv Comp Syst CRACS, P-4169007 Porto, Portugal.; Paiva, JC (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Dept Comp Sci, Fac Sci, P-4169007 Porto, Portugal.";"jose.c.paiva@inesctec.pt; zp@dcc.fc.up.pt; ricardoqueiros@esmad.ipp.pt";NA;"Queiros, Ricardo/0000-0002-1985-6285; Leal, Jose Paulo/0000-0002-8409-0300; Paiva, Jose Carlos/0000-0003-0394-0527";National Funds through the Portuguese funding agency, FCT -Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UIDB/50014/2020];This work is financed by National Funds through the Portuguese funding agency, FCT -Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, within project UIDB/50014/2020.;NA;54;0;0;2;2;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2078-2489;NA;INFORMATION;Information;NOV;2020;11;11;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;498;10.3390/info11110498;NA;NA;20;Computer Science, Information Systems;Computer Science;OX1OH;WOS:000593342500001;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

It comprises a collection of exercises including recent service robot applications in real life, with different robots such as autonomous cars, drones or vacuum cleaners. It uses Robot Operating System (ROS) middleware, the de facto standard in robot programming, the 3D Gazebo simulator and the Python programming language. For each exercise, a software template has been developed, performing all the auxiliary tasks such as the graphical interface, connection to the sensors and actuators, timing of the code, etc. This also hosts the student's code. Using this template, the student just focuses on the robot intelligence (for instance, perception and control algorithms) without wasting time on auxiliary details which have little educational value. The templates are coded as ROS nodes or as Jupyter Notebooks ready to use in the web browser. Reference solutions for illustrative purposes and automatic assessment tools for gamification have also been developed. An introductory course to intelligent robotics has been elaborated and its contents are available and ready to use at Robotics-Academy, including reactive behaviors, path planning, local/global navigation, and self-localization algorithms. Robotics-Academy provides a valuable complement to master classes in blended learning, massive online open courses (MOOCs) and online video courses, devoted to addressing theoretical content. This open educational tool connects that theory with practical robot applications and is suitable to be used in distance education.

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses was used in the literature search, with the critical analysis and leveling of evidence. After determining the search terms, four electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, ERIC, and Cochrane) were searched with the guidance of a medical librarian. Eight reviewers participated, and an evidence-based practice specialist served as auditor. Twenty-three articles were included in the review, which revealed overall support for the gamification process with specific findings about optimizing the process. The review further suggested that interactive digital learning in the form of games, gamification, or scenario-based learning has a positive effect on learner engagement and satisfaction; however, none of the studies were able to quantify objective data about knowledge retention. Further research is needed to test different modalities that improve both learner engagement and knowledge retention.

Methods: A game show-based curriculum was developed from the basic principles of RID, which include the following: (1) distinguishing between clinical manifestations of STIs and management of long-term sequelae of STIs; (2) evaluation and management of common gynecologic infectious diseases, including chronic vaginitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and other pelvic infections; (3) diagnosis and management of perinatal infectious diseases, such as parvovirus, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, toxoplasmosis, and infection-mediated prematurity; (4) evaluation and management of obstetric and gynecologic postoperative infections; and (5) diagnosis and management of acute and chronic human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus infections in pregnancy. OBGYN residents at a large urban academic training program were randomized to either a Jeopardy-style educational game show intervention plus a traditional didactic-based curriculum or traditional didactic-based curriculum alone. The study team recruited participants by sending out an e-mail to all of the residents, detailing the study and consent process. Participants from both the intervention and control groups completed confidence and knowledge-based pretests. Posttests were administered 4 weeks after completion of the pretests. Statistical methods were applied to analyze the data. Results: Thirty-eight residents were randomized to a Jeopardy-style game show-based educational intervention (n = 19) or to a traditional didactic-based curriculum (n = 19). All of the participants (100%) completed the pre- and posttests. Pretest median scores were similar between both groups, in which the Jeopardy group had a median score of 48.5 and the traditional group had a median score of 51.4 (P = 0.091). The Jeopardy group median test scores improved between the pretest and posttest (48.5 vs 62.8, P <= 0.001). The traditional didactic-based curriculum had a minimal increase in its median posttest scores (51.4 compared with 54.2, P = 0.773). The Jeopardy group had significantly higher posttest median scores and confidence scores than the traditional didactic-based curriculum (Jeopardy = 62.8, traditional = 54.2, P = 0.002). Conclusions: A game show-based curriculum improves OBGYN residents' confidence and retention of knowledge regarding RIDs, clinical manifestations and sequelae of STIs, and management of serious long-term consequences of STIs. Additional studies that include longer posttest time intervals are needed to assess the longer-term impact of game show-based curriculum on knowledge retention among OBGYN residents.";"Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, Pittsburgh, PA USA; Northwestern Univ, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA";Butler, SK (corresponding author), UPMC Magee Womens Hosp, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, 300 Halket St, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.;"butlersk@upmc.edu; meganrunge@northwestern.edu; milad@northwestern.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;29;0;0;0;0;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;0038-4348;1541-8243;NA;SOUTH MED J;South.Med.J.;NOV;2020;113;11;NA;NA;NA;NA;531;537;NA;10.14423/SMJ.0000000000001165;NA;NA;7;Medicine, General & Internal;General & Internal Medicine;OI6RU;WOS:000583404100001;33140104;NA;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

The research has an exploratory nature as it involves the design and pilot test of an application based on gamification known as HEgameApp in an undergraduate program in tourism in the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain). This research study analyses whether students' intention to use this gamified app is determined by their perception of expected benefits (functional, hedonic and social), by the costs associated with the use of the application (loss of privacy and difficulty of use) or by their personal characteristics (attitude towards learning, attitude towards innovation and demographic profile). The results show that expected hedonic and social benefits influence a student's intention to use HEgameApp. Our findings also evidence that students' attitude towards learning as well as to innovation has a positive and significant role in a student's intention to use a gamified app. Finally, the results show that the loss of privacy exerts a moderator effect on the relationship between the intention to use the gamified app HEgameApp and expected functional benefits. Therefore, the empirical results demonstrate that educational community could do a great deal to enhance a student's intention to use gamification strategies leading to the greater application of innovative technological, educational tools in tourism face-to-face learning.;"[Aguiar-Castillo, Lidia; Hernandez-Lopez, Lidia; De Saa-Perez, Petra; Perez-Jimenez, Rafael] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, IDeTIC, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain";De Saa-Perez, P (corresponding author), Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, IDeTIC, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain.;"laguiar@idetic.eu; lidiaesther.hernandez@ulpgc.es; petra.desaaperez@ulpgc.es; rafael.perez@ulpgc.es";"PEREZ-JIMENEZ, RAFAEL/AAA-8455-2021; De Saa-Perez, Petra/AAJ-4345-2020; Aguiar-Castillo, Carmen Lidia/L-3266-2017";"PEREZ-JIMENEZ, RAFAEL/0000-0002-8849-592X; De Saa-Perez, Petra/0000-0002-3945-5454; Aguiar-Castillo, Carmen Lidia/0000-0002-9938-0386";NA;NA;NA;95;1;1;49;49;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;1473-8376;NA;NA;J HOSP LEIS SPORT TO;J.

Health professions educators increasingly turn to gamification to optimize students' learning outcomes. However, little is known about the concept of gamification and its possible working mechanisms. This review focused on empirical evidence for the effectiveness of gamification approaches and theoretical rationales for applying the chosen game attributes. We systematically searched multiple databases, and included all empirical studies evaluating the use of game attributes in health professions education. Of 5044 articles initially identified, 44 met the inclusion criteria. Negative outcomes for using gamification were not reported. Almost all studies included assessment attributes (n = 40), mostly in combination with conflict/challenge attributes (n = 27). Eight studies revealed that this specific combination had increased the use of the learning material, sometimes leading to improved learning outcomes. A relatively small number of studies was performed to explain mechanisms underlying the use of game attributes (n = 7). Our findings suggest that it is possible to improve learning outcomes in health professions education by using gamification, especially when employing game attributes that improve learning behaviours and attitudes towards learning. However, most studies lacked well-defined control groups and did not apply and/or report theory to understand underlying processes. Future research should clarify mechanisms underlying gamified educational interventions and explore theories that could explain the effects of these interventions on learning outcomes, using well-defined control groups, in a longitudinal way. In doing so, we can build on existing theories and gain a practical and comprehensive understanding of how to select the right game elements for the right educational context and the right type of student.;"[van Gaalen, A.

However, the motivations driving individuals' learning behavior differ from their motivations when playing. There is no evidence that learners' experiences in gamified activities are described by these models. Thus, an alternative model capturing learners' motivational experiences and relating them to the motivational mechanisms of gamification design is needed. To fill this gap we propose a context-specific typology which groups learners based on their type of motivation and perceived ability associated with a learning activity. The purpose of this proposal is to provide a framework for connecting each learner's type to a set of motivational affordances to which that type is susceptible. Facilitating the task of selecting motivational affordances matching learner's type aids the design of customized gamified learning.;"[Dichev, Christo; Dicheva, Darina; Irwin, Keith] Winston Salem State Univ, Winston Salem, NC 27110 USA";Dichev, C (corresponding author), Winston Salem State Univ, Winston Salem, NC 27110 USA.;dichevc@wssu.edu;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;48;0;0;8;10;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;2365-9440;NA;NA;INT J EDUC TECHNOL H;Int.

Aim: In this study we developed and evaluated gamification in cardiovascular pharmacology lessons for the nursing students of Jahrom University of Medical Sciences. Methods: This study was guise experiment study conducted in two parts (design, implementation, and evaluation). The first part was writing the scenario of the game, the questions byexpert panel, and agreement-based. In the next level, gamification was designed by the Microsoft Asp.net Core technology withspecialized team of educational and engineering designers. Then, it was delivered on www.pharmaplay.ir. Results: Intervention was conducted on 30 students from nursing and paramedical students. Data collection was performed using a questionnaire with 21 questions, 5 continuum with 4 dimension and professors' attitudes were examined by 23 questions from advantages and disadvantages of the app.Also, the students' learning was assessed with pre-test and post-test. The analysis showed that qualitative mean was related to profound learning and enjoyment. In general, the participants had positive opinions in all fields (higher mean all items). In evaluation of professors' viewpoints, in general, the qualitative mean of views was 3.43 that is an indicator of their positive viewpoint on this educational method. Students' scores of learning increased from the mean (14.70vs 17.6) after playing the game. Conclusion: Using new and active methods by engaging the students in their learning and creating an attractive and fun environment can help students to learn more effectively and profoundly, and also allow them to enjoy learning in a motivational environment.;"[Saeidmirzaei] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Med Educ, Shiraz, Iran; [Leilimosalanejad] Jahrom Univ Med Sci, Med Educ Dept, Jahrom, Iran; [Atashpour, S.] Jahrom Univ Med Sci, Pharmacol Dept, Jahrom, Iran; [Bazrafcan, Leila] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Med Educ Dept, Shiraz, Iran";Leilimosalanejad (corresponding author), Jahrom Univ Med Sci, Med Educ Dept, Jahrom, Iran.;mosallanejad@gjums.ac.ir;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;26;0;0;1;1;LAHORE MEDICAL & DENTAL COLL;LAHORE;CANAL BANK N, TULSPURA, LAHORE, 00000, PAKISTAN;1996-7195;NA;NA;PAK J MED HEALTH SCI;Pak.

Previous works deal with teaching about privacy using educational online content, and media literacy. However, these tools do not necessarily promote less risky behaviors, and do not allow the assessment of users' behavior after the learning period. Moreover, few research studies about the effects of social gamification have been performed for this population segment (i.e., teenagers). To address this problem in this article, we propose the use of gamification in an OSN called Pesedia to facilitate the teaching/learning process, and assess its effectiveness in promoting suitable privacy behaviors. We tested our proposal comparing teenagers' performance in two editions of a course about social networks, and privacy (with, and without gamification) for one month. We measured the impact of gamification in the participants' behaviors toward privacy concepts as a consequence of the privacy teaching/learning process, and the participants' engagement in the educational process. The results show that there are significant differences in participants' behavior regarding privacy, and engagement in the gamified social network. Moreover, there is also a significant difference in participants' engagement for the gamified male participants. The gamified social network proposed in this article may be relevant, and useful for educators who wish to develop, and enhance teenagers' privacy skills, or for a broader base of aspects related to the development of digital competences, and technology in education.;"[Alemany, Jose; Garcia-Fornes, Ana] Univ Politecn Valencia, Valencian Res Inst Artificial Intelligence VRAIN, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Val, Elena Del] Escuela Univ Politecn Teruel, Dept Informat & Ingn Sistemas DIIS, Teruel 44003, Spain";Del Val, E (corresponding author), Escuela Univ Politecn Teruel, Dept Informat & Ingn Sistemas DIIS, Teruel 44003, Spain.;"jalemany1@dsic.upv.es; edelval@unizar.es; agarcia@dsic.upv.es";"Del-Val-Noguera, Elena/AAH-5711-2020; Garcia-Fornes, Ana/C-8260-2014";"Del-Val-Noguera, Elena/0000-0002-1279-3429; Garcia-Fornes, Ana/0000-0003-4482-8793; Alemany, Jose/0000-0002-5116-5935";"Spanish GovernmentSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [TIN2017-89156-R]; FPISpanish Government [BFS-2015-074498]";This work was supported in part by the Spanish Government Project TIN2017-89156-R, and in part by the FPI under Grant BFS-2015-074498.

Previous research has proposed various game motivators and game design principles to alleviate this, but a comprehensive synthesis has yet to appear. In this article, we conducted a systematic literature review that yielded two major contributions: 1) a taxonomy of 56 game motivators in 14 classes; and 2) a taxonomy of 54 educational game design principles in 13 classes, with linkages to the identified game motivators. As a minor contribution, we have also presented a classification of gamification-related terms and proposed different strategies for applying gamification.

We consider the goals established for this course and how we endeavored to achieve them through a fully self-contained and integrated game-Citizenship Quest-making use of the class learning management system. We then consider surveys of students' learning outcomes and feedback concerning the game during the first two semesters, Fall 2017 and Spring 2018. We conclude by considering development issues dealt with by the instructor and the instructional design team in how Citizenship Quest-a simulation of the citizenship process-was embedded into this class.;"[Stewart, Patrick A.; Terrell, Elaine; Kareev, Alex M.; Ellison, Blake Tylar] Univ Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Urteaga, Charini I.] Univ Arkansas, Educ Technol, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA";Stewart, PA (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Polit Sci, 428 Old Main, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.;"pastewar@uark.edu; elaine@uark.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;25;1;1;0;0;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1551-2169;1551-2177;NA;J POLITICAL SCI EDUC;J.

An educational social-networking platform gathered information about the contributions of participants and about the social networks that were formed during the course. A gamification layer with three game elements (points, badges, and leaderboard) was then implemented in the online learning platform. Social network analysis (SNA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to analyze the differences between a treatment and a comparison group (N = 591 and N = 427), using a set of 20 variables for each participant which quantified contributions to the learning platform as well as position and influence in the social network. The results of SNA show that gamification influences the structure of the social network of the course. The results also suggest that the variables cluster similarly for each group and that the linear combination of variables called the first component (F1) is a good descriptor of students' work and position in the network. F1 can be used to build predictive models of course completion.

Students are even more demanding, and professors need to follow the evolution of technology and try to increase student engagement in the classrooms (presential or virtual). Higher education students recognise that the introduction of new tools and learning methods can improve the teaching quality and increase the motivation to learn. Regarding a question about which type of classes students preferred, ninety-one point ninety-nine per cent (91.99%) of the students wanted interactive classes over traditional. Having this concern in mind over the past years, a professor explored a set of methods, strategies and tools and designed a new and innovative paradigm using gamification. This approach is denominated TechTeach and explores a set of trending concepts and interactive tools to teach computer science subjects. It was designed to run in a B-learning environment. The paradigm uses flipped classrooms, bring your own device (BYOD), gamification, training of soft-skills and quizzes and surveys to increase the student's engagement and provide the best learning environment to students. Currently, COVID-19 is bringing about new challenges, and TechTeach was improved in order to be more suitable for this new way of teaching (from 0% to 100% online classes). This article details this method and shows how it can be applied in a real environment. A case study was used to prove the functionality and relevance of this approach, and the achieved results are motivating. During the semester, more than a hundred students experienced this new way of teaching and assessment. In the end, more than eighty-one per cent (81%) of the students gave a positive grade to the approach, and more than ninety-five per cent (95.65%) of the students approved the use of the concept of BYOD in the classroom.

A novel application of serious games in engaging and educating end-users has been validated during the last years. However, there is little research focusing on the review of its development trends, categories and approaches. The proposed paper reviews serious games as an engaging medium for building energy consumption. The research focuses on the role of energy-consumption awareness-related education in motivating end-users to save energy and make informed decisions to change energy-related behaviours. This research stresses the approaches to underlining the issue as ascertained from a number of efficiency-related serious games. The investigation suggests the potential impact that serious games can have on changing the domestic practices of householders, in a safe, fun and interactive environment. This would enable householders to investigate alternative ways of meeting energy-consumption targets and realise the limits to their energy-saving potential. It concludes that at present, serious games do not take advantage of the opportunities available in energy monitoring and sub-metering, or real-life energy behaviours. Meanwhile, the existing evaluation framework for the effectiveness of an energy serious game still needs to be further developed. However, active engagement in energy monitoring has contributed to numerous past successes in energy use reduction, and gamification and serious games show great potential for building upon these achievements.;"[Wu, Xianfeng] China Architecture Design & Res Grp, 19 Chegongzhuang St, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xianfeng] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Architecture, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shuli; Shukla, Ashish] Coventry Univ, Fac Engn Environm & Comp, 1 Gulson Rd, Coventry CV1 2JH, W Midlands, England";"Wu, XF (corresponding author), China Architecture Design & Res Grp, 19 Chegongzhuang St, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.; Wu, XF (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Architecture, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.";"wuxianfeng@cadg.cn; aa6328@coventry.ac.uk; ab4322@coventry.ac.uk";NA;Wu, Xianfeng/0000-0002-2405-0737;EPSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/K002716/1];This research was funded by EPSRC, grant number EP/K002716/1, An Intelligent Digital Household Network to Transform Low Carbon Lifestyles.;NA;59;0;0;6;6;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2071-1050;NA;SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL;Sustainability;OCT;2020;12;20;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;8508;10.3390/su12208508;NA;NA;16;"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies";"Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology";OI1ZC;WOS:000583084500001;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

This is because it allows the expression of several problems related to digital design, artificial intelligence, databases, compilers, and formal languages, among others, as a sequence of Boolean operations and variables, which can be dealt with by using Boolean algebra methods to optimize algorithms, minimize digital components, and so forth. This study presents a piece of web-based software, denominated as MiniBool, which has been developed with the objective of supporting the learning of Boolean algebra in a blended learning setting. This educational proposal gives students the opportunity to reinforce learning at any time and in any place. It additionally increases the learners' motivation by including gamification, through the use of a ranking that shows the students' level of participation. MiniBool was evaluated by means of a formal experiment, which was carried out with Discrete Mathematics students at a higher education institution in Mexico, where two groups were formed randomly: A control group, whose members attended classes and reinforced their knowledge in a traditional manner with a pencil and paper, and an experimental group, which learned in a blended learning context, receiving the same classes as the control group, but reinforcing what they had learned using MiniBool. The statistical results obtained indicate that the use of MiniBool has a positive and motivating effect on learning and that a greater academic performance is achieved than when the traditional teaching-learning method is applied.;"[Jimenez-Hernandez, Erendira M.; Oktaba, Hanna; Diaz-Barriga, Frida] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, 3000 Circuito Escolar, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Piattini, Mario] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Escuela Super Informat, Ciudad Real, Spain";Jimenez-Hernandez, EM (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, 3000 Circuito Escolar, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.;erendira.jimenez@ciencias.unam.mx;Piattini, Mario/F-6271-2013;"Piattini, Mario/0000-0002-7212-8279; Oktaba, Hanna/0000-0003-2852-4490; DIAZ BARRIGA ARCEO, FRIDA/0000-0001-8720-1857";Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT);Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT);NA;85;0;0;7;16;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;NA;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

Platforms such as Kahoot!, accompanied by the student's smartphone, allow the teacher to create a classroom response system (CRS) a fast and straightforward way. The present study, with a non-experimental design, is developed to assess the use of this tool in higher education, both in a face-to-face format and through a virtual learning environment. After applying an electronic questionnaire (20 items; alpha=.958) to a sample of 148 students (94 in the face-to-face mode and 54 in the virtual mode) whose teachers had used Kahoot! with the same methodological planning, a high degree of predisposition for their employment as future teaching professionals and positive perception of the resource is detected, especially when assessing their potential for self-assessment of the learning process and assimilation of the basic concepts of the subject. Likewise, after the Mann-Whitney U test, it was found that students in the virtual mode showed a higher score than those in the face-to-face mode. It concludes by stressing the importance of teachers using technological resources such as Kahoot to promote innovative methodologies for the benefit of quality higher education. Besides, as a consequence of the previous studies, it is considered that the discrepancies found are due to a more positive evaluation in the training modality where the use of this type of resources is more innovative.";"[Pablo Hernandez-Ramos, Juan] Univ Int La Rioja, Fac Educ, Logrono, Spain; [Luisa Belmonte, Maria] Univ Murcia, Fac Educ, Murcia, Spain";Hernandez-Ramos, JP (corresponding author), Univ Int La Rioja, Fac Educ, Logrono, Spain.;"juanpablo.hernandez@unir.net; marialuisa.belmonte@um.es";HERNANDEZ-RAMOS, JUAN PABLO/A-9743-2017;HERNANDEZ-RAMOS, JUAN PABLO/0000-0002-0902-5453;NA;NA;NA;61;2;2;4;13;EDICIONES UNIV SALAMANCA;SALAMANCA;APARTADO DE CORREOS 325, SALAMANCA, 00000, SPAIN;2444-8729;NA;NA;EDUC KNOWL SOC;Educ.

As mental health can strongly influence academic performance, addressing the loss of community by transitioning to distance education, midsemester, is imperative. This work draws upon the community and wellness benefits associated with online gaming and applies it to ChemDraw. The goal is to improve the class wellness and social community while teaching valuable organic chemistry skills. In this paper, a molecule, speed-drawing tournament (Molecule Madness) is presented along with reflections describing the impacts on student wellness and organic chemistry skills. Gamification of ChemDraw is achieved by (1) treating at-home practice as video-game training and (2) using video-conferencing software as a medium for multiplayer gameplay. As the primary focus is placed on education rather than entertainment, ChemDraw is subclassified as a serious educational game. Community is developed by in-game, online chat: observers, announcers, and competitors all interact with each other in real time. The tournament provided students an event to look forward to, helped maintain/improve class community, and developed organic chemistry skills (molecular drawing, history of molecules, and conversational IUPAC) in addition to increased appreciation for IUPAC nomenclature. Although an online community cannot substitute for in-person classroom experiences, this activity supplements the loss of community associated with social distancing and could be extended to enhance community within a face-to-face environment. Additionally, ideas are presented that illustrate how other chemistry classes and topics can be gamified in computer environments (both single- and multiplayer) by drawing upon well-established gaming modes (story mode, maker mode, and speed runs). Overall, this work highlights the supplemental role that chemistry video games can play in learning chemistry: by engaging students in an alternative, yet familiar to many format, classroom community and student confidence are maintained/strengthened.;[Fontana, Matthew T.] Santa Rosa Jr Coll, Dept Chem & Phys, Santa Rosa, CA 95401 USA;Fontana, MT (corresponding author), Santa Rosa Jr Coll, Dept Chem & Phys, Santa Rosa, CA 95401 USA.;mfontana@santarosa.edu;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;99;2;2;18;27;AMER CHEMICAL SOC;WASHINGTON;1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0021-9584;1938-1328;NA;J CHEM EDUC;J.

The design and development of socio-educational and community projects in music training centres are tasks which, in using music as a tool towards mediation, can contribute to alleviate social dysfunctions in the nearby surroundings as well as to create social cohesion and feelings of community belonging and identity. Nevertheless, there is some inertia in the way things are done and a perpetuation of traditional models of education in music where there is no room for innovative projects with authentic social engagement. This paper will analyse the challenges and contexts that music schools face in the 21st Century at a social and community level, and how to address them with new educational models. The social commitment and engagement of music training institutions should spark a change in the design of activities through innovation as well as opening new avenues for collaboration with other social and institutional community actors. To illustrate these synergies as well as the design process of a socio-educational project, a proposal design of a socio-educational workshop will be put forth as a practical guide in the development of these programmes.;[Lorenzo de Reizabal, Margarita] Ctr Super Mus Pais Vasco, Donostia San Sebastian, Spain;de Reizabal, ML (corresponding author), Ctr Super Mus Pais Vasco, Donostia San Sebastian, Spain.;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;18;0;0;1;1;ARTSEDUCA;VALENCIA;ARTSEDUCA, VALENCIA, 00000, SPAIN;2254-0709;NA;NA;ARTSEDUCA;ARTSEDUCA;SEP;2020;NA;27;NA;NA;NA;NA;36;53;NA;NA;NA;NA;18;Humanities, Multidisciplinary;Arts & Humanities - Other Topics;OF1EM;WOS:000580960300004;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

But when the feeling of anxiety is persistent and interferes with a person's day to day life then this may likely be an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are a common issue worldwide and can fall under general anxiety, panic attacks, and social anxiety among others. They can be disabling and can impact all aspects of an individual's life, including work, education, and personal relationships. It is important that people with anxiety receive appropriate care, which in some cases may prove difficult due to mental health care delivery barriers such as cost, stigma, or distance from mental health services. A potential solution to this could be mobile mental health applications. These can serve as effective and promising tools to assist in the management of anxiety and to overcome some of the aforementioned barriers. The objective of this study is to provide an analysis of treatment and management-related functionality and characteristics of high-rated mobile applications (apps) for anxiety, which are available for Android and iOS systems. Method: A broad search was performed in the Google Play Store and App Store following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol to identify existing apps for anxiety. A set of free and highly rated apps for anxiety were identified and the selected apps were then installed and analyzed according to a predefined data extraction strategy. Results: A total of 167 anxiety apps were selected (123 Android apps and 44 iOS apps). Besides anxiety, the selected apps addressed several health issues including stress, depression, sleep issues, and eating disorders. The apps adopted various treatment and management approaches such as meditation, breathing exercises, mind-fulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. Results also showed that 51% of the selected apps used various gamification features to motivate users to keep using them, 32% provided social features including chat, communication with others and links to sources of help; 46% offered offline availability; and only 19% reported involvement of mental health professionals in their design. Conclusions: Anxiety apps incorporate various mental health care management methods and approaches. Apps can serve as promising tools to assist large numbers of people suffering from general anxiety or from anxiety disorders, anytime, anywhere, and particularly in the current COVID-19 pandemic.";"[Drissi, Nidal; Ouhbi, Sofia] UAE Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, CIT, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Drissi, Nidal; Idrissi, Mohammed Abdou Janati] Mohammed V Univ Rabat, ENSIAS, Rabat, Morocco; [Ghogho, Mounir] Int Univ Rabat, TICLab, Rabat, Morocco";Ouhbi, S (corresponding author), UAE Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, CIT, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.;"drissi.nidal@uaeu.ac.ae; sofia.ouhbi@uaeu.ac.ae; a.janati@um5s.net.ma; mounir.ghogho@uir.ac.ma";Ouhbi, Sofia/H-3641-2019;Ouhbi, Sofia/0000-0001-7614-9731;"Abu Dhabi Young Investigator Award (AYIA) - Abu Dhabi Research and Development Authority (ADRDA) [AYIA19-001]; United Arab Emirates University [31T131]";This work is part of the Abu Dhabi Young Investigator Award (AYIA) 2019 (#AYIA19-001) awarded by the Abu Dhabi Research and Development Authority (ADRDA) and the Startup project (#31T131) funded by the United Arab Emirates University.;NA;91;0;0;14;16;ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD;CLARE;ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND;1386-5056;1872-8243;NA;INT J MED INFORM;Int.

The objective of this paper is to explore whether and how different approaches for designing medical educational tools affect students' learning performance. Materials and methods: Four versions of an educational tool for the study of clinical cases were implemented: a 2D version, a gamified 2D version, a gamified 3D version, and a gamified immersive-virtual-reality version. All complying with the same functional requirements. Each version was used and evaluated by an independent group of students. The participants (n=78) evaluated the applications regarding usefulness, usability, and gamification. Afterward, the students took an exam to assess the retention of information on the clinical cases presented. Results: One-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank tests confirmed that the participants perceived that it was at least quite likely that gamification helped improved their learning. In addition, based on the participants' perception, the gamification of the immersive-virtual-reality version helped the most to improve their learning performance in comparison with the gamified 2D and 3D versions. Conclusions: Regardless of whether different versions of a medical educational tool (complying with the same functional requirements) are perceived as equally useful and usable, the design approach (either 2D, 3D, or immersive-virtual-reality with or without gamification) affects students' retention of information on clinical cases.;"[Lopez Chavez, Omar; Rodriguez, Luis-Felipe] Inst Tecnol Sonora, Obregon 85000, Sonora, Mexico; [Octavio Gutierrez-Garcia, J.] ITAM, Rio Hondo 1, Ciudad De Mexico 01080, Mexico";Gutierrez-Garcia, JO (corresponding author), ITAM, Rio Hondo 1, Ciudad De Mexico 01080, Mexico.;"omar.lopez@potros.itson.edu.mx; luis.rodriguez@itson.edu.mx; octavio.gutierrez@itam.mx";NA;Gutierrez-Garcia, J.

The purpose of this research is to analyze the effectiveness of the use of an Escape Room as an active methodology to learn mathematics. A quantitative research method was performed through an experimental design. Two study groups were set up. With the control group, a traditional training methodology was used, and with the experimental group, an innovative one was used through an Escape room experience. A total of 62 students of the 3rd level of Secondary Education from an educational center in Ceuta (Spain) participated. Results show how the experience developed through the escape room improved achievement, motivation and autonomy in a significant way. It has also reduced learning anxiety significantly. It is concluded that the use of the Escape room in Mathematics improves learning achievement, anxiety, motivation and autonomy, with gender being a variable to be taken into account, especially in motivation and autonomy.

When applied in education, it is an approach to motivate and engage students in their learning process by incorporating game design principles. This paper presents the design and deployment of a game conducted in parallel with two groups of the engineering course operations research. The game design is theoretically supported, and unlike literature, the game proposed has the main distinguishing features: (a) it is carried out in parallel with the standard course, where player participation is optional, with extrinsic motivators regarding the final grade, (b) it lasts the entire semester, and it was applied to different groups with the same instructor, (c) in addition to academic performance, it has other social relatedness desired outcomes, (d) it combines the use of specific game elements divided in three types of activities: Mastery, related to the core topics of the class, Institutional, related to the university life and community, and Teamwork activities; and (e) it uses a WhatsApp chat group as the common communication platform. The assessment is twofold: the effects on learning, measured in two indicators, failure rate and average grade; and the perception of the game itself. Statistical results present empirical evidence of the positive effects of gamification on academic performance and other desired behaviors of social relatedness, such as a sense of belonging and teamwork.";[Diaz-Ramirez, Jenny] Univ Monterrey, Monterrey, NL, Mexico;Diaz-Ramirez, J (corresponding author), Univ Monterrey, Monterrey, NL, Mexico.;jenny.diaz@udem.edu;NA;NA;Universidad de Monterrey;Author thanks Universidad de Monterrey for its support to publish this paper.;NA;23;1;2;1;1;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;2405-8440;NA;NA;HELIYON;Heliyon;SEP;2020;6;9;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;e04972;10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04972;NA;NA;10;Multidisciplinary Sciences;Science & Technology - Other Topics;OC4NY;WOS:000579136000169;32995639;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Previous studies showed that the existing mobile applications have similar functionalities, such as intervention with questionnaires, and the use of gamification techniques to improve interactiveness. However, unlike our study, some studies are not validated and verified by healthcare professionals. Additionally, this study intends to promote the interaction between the teenagers and the medical communities. In this study, we analyze the benefits of the proposed mobile application, which features monitoring of physical activity, daily tips and curiosities, questionnaires, and gamification through earning points. Most of the teenagers were satisfied with the physical activity monitoring and found the tips, curiosities, and weekly questionnaires useful. The study started with 26 teenagers from two schools in the center of Portugal that would use the mobile application for five weeks. Still, at the end of the study, only 7 teenagers finalized the study. The decreasing number of teenagers in the study was affected by the lack of social interaction caused by the pandemic situation. During the period, the mobile application would engage the users with notifications on nutrition and physical activity, challenges concerning the number of steps and calories they would have to spend, and questionnaires related to the curiosities and suggestions from the previous week. We used Fisher's test to investigate the relationship between the assessment obtained in the responses to the questionnaires, and the adoption of healthier eating and sports practices. In summary, participants were satisfied with the mobile application and experienced some improvements in diet and habits.;"[Villasana, Maria Vanessa; Sa, Juliana] Univ Beira Interior, Fac Hlth Sci, P-6200506 Covilha, Portugal; [Pires, Ivan Miguel; Garcia, Nuno M.] Univ Beira Interior, Inst Telecomunicacoes, P-6200001 Covilha, Portugal; [Pires, Ivan Miguel] Polytech Inst Viseu, Dept Comp Sci, P-3504510 Viseu, Portugal; [Sa, Juliana] Cova Beira Hosp Ctr, P-6200251 Covilha, Portugal; [Teixeira, Maria Canavarro] Polytech Inst Castelo Branco, UTC Recursos Nat & Desenvolvimento Sustentavel, P-6000909 Castelo Branco, Portugal; [Teixeira, Maria Canavarro] Polytech Inst Castelo Branco, CERNAS IPCB, Res Ctr Nat Resources Environm & Soc, P-6000909 Castelo Branco, Portugal; [Zdravevski, Eftim; Chorbev, Ivan; Lameski, Petre] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Comp Sci & Engn, Skopje 1000, North Macedonia";Villasana, MV (corresponding author), Univ Beira Interior, Fac Hlth Sci, P-6200506 Covilha, Portugal.;"maria.vanessa.villasana.abreu@ubi.pt; impires@it.ubi.pt; julianasa@fcsaude.ubi.pt; ngarcia@di.ubi.pt; ccanavarro@ipcb.pt; eftim.zdravevski@finki.ukim.mk; ivan.chorbev@finki.ukim.mk; petre.lameski@finki.ukim.mk";Pires, Ivan M/V-3573-2017;"Pires, Ivan M/0000-0002-3394-6762; Canavarro, Cristina/0000-0002-8534-9484; Villasana, Maria Vanessa/0000-0002-4957-9477; Sa, Juliana/0000-0002-6776-7789; Garcia, Nuno/0000-0002-3195-3168";"FCT/MEC; FEDER-PT2020 [UIDB/EEA/50008/2020]; University of Sts.

Hence, to address such gaps, this study explored Thai EFL learner acceptance and perceived risk of cheating of using Socrative for vocabulary tests. The participants (N = 461, 77.4% female, 22.6% male) attended a General English (GE) course that required them to learn fifty English words every week. The vocabulary tests took place in the first ten minutes of the class for ten weeks delivered by using Socrative. At the end of the course, this study investigated learner acceptance and perceived risk of cheating using a set of survey constructed based on Davis (1989) and collected the data of vocabulary learning outcomes and proficiency levels. The data were, then, analysed by using independent t-test, correlation, and multiple regression analyses. The results indicated Thai EFL learner acceptance of Socrative with the risk of cheating during vocabulary tests. Learner acceptance was influenced by proficiency level and predicted a small amount of learning outcomes.

They play an especially prominent role in higher education, where they are used to promote content knowledge as well as higher order cognitive skills and competencies such as communication, collaboration, or problem solving. Despite some known positive effects of serious games on learning, critical voices claim that the objectives of a specific game often do not match the learning objectives and that the games focus on entertaining much more than learning. Considering these arguments and some general guidelines of using games in (higher) education, we developed a game on typical chemical misconceptions based on the popular game Activity (c) using Participatory Action Research. The game was developed based on the contents of a seminar on misconceptions for pre-service teachers (M. Ed. students) in a northern German university. It covers seven content areas where misconceptions are most prevalent and therefore aims at contributing to pre-service teachers' Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK). The students are supposed to draw or mime specific misconceptions. Initial trials in three university courses showed a very positive perception of the game.;"[Belova, Nadja; Zowada, Christian] Univ Bremen, Inst Sci Educ, Dept Biol & Chem, Chem Educ Grp, D-28359 Bremen, Germany";Belova, N (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Inst Sci Educ, Dept Biol & Chem, Chem Educ Grp, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.;"belova@uni-bremen.de; christian.zowada@uni-bremen.de";Belova, Nadja/AAL-9319-2021;Zowada, Christian/0000-0002-0522-464X;Verband der Chemischen Industrie [189023];This research was funded by Verband der Chemischen Industrie, grant number 189023.;NA;35;0;0;8;8;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2227-7102;NA;EDUC SCI;Educ.

This research has been based on a bibliometric methodology. A classic bibliometric and thematic analyses have been carried out. A 1230 document matrix analysis has been selected. For descriptive bibliometrics, the Bibliometrix library is used, while Scimat is used for the thematic analysis. Both tools are widely used in this type of study. Results indicate that growth on the study of these topics is booming. There are also authors who accumulate most of the documents, such as Marti Parreno. English is positioned as the predominant language. The topics studied have evolved from how classic games affect learning to the study of video games and their impact on performance.

However, using serious games within project management education is not well understood. The aim of this research is to investigate project management serious games in higher education: i) determine the extent of gamification in PMI-accredited project management programs, and ii) survey university students about their experiences playing project management serious games. Two separate mixed-method studies reveal insights about serious games in higher education and where innovations may be leveraged. Traditional statistics were used to analyze quantitative data, and coding was used to analyze the qualitative data. The results from a global survey of ten PMI-accredited university programs suggest that serious games are embryonic but promising. A case study at one university reveals that students enjoy learning through games but caution against using games to formally assess students' learning.

This model combines the advantages of gamification, the flipped classroom and the use of low-fidelity clinical simulation, also including self-reflection and peer evaluation of the situations experienced. Objectives: To evaluate the students' perception of the implementation of GREENS (c) as a learning and assessment tool in an academic course at the University of Almeria. Design: A cross-sectional descriptive study. Settings: Academic year 2018/2019, at the University of Almeria (UAL), Spain. Participants: 77 students enrolled in their 2nd year of the Nursing Degree who attended the Health Promotion and Safety class. Methods: After completing the GREENS (c) activity, the perception and anxiety of students were analyzed through an online ad hoc questionnaire composed of 17 questions. Data were collected in January 2019. Results: All of the questions scored above 4 out of a maximum of 5 on a Likert scale. For all the questions,> 50% of the students were in total agreement with the questions answered, showing a high acceptance of the GREENS (c) methodology implementation. The students reported that their anxiety decreased significantly, with a score of 4.7 points on average (95% CI: 4.16 to 5.33, p < 0.001), after knowing that the assessment would be through a gamification tool, not an oral one. More than 60% of the students answered agree or strongly agree with the idea that GREENS (c) is useful for improving motivation, teamwork, learning, fun and knowledge assessment. Conclusions: The use of GREENS (c) has generated a high satisfaction and motivation of the students in their learning process, and as an assessment tool, it created a lower degree of anxiety as compared to an oral examination.;"[Jimenez-Rodriguez, Diana; Belmonte Garcia, Teresa] Univ Almeria, Dept Nursing Physiotherapy & Med, Carretera Sacramento S N, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Arizo Luque, Vanessa] Catholic Univ Murcia UCAM, Fac Nursing, Murcia, Spain";Jimenez-Rodriguez, D (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Dept Nursing Physiotherapy & Med, Carretera Sacramento S N, Almeria 04120, Spain.;"d.jimenez@ual.es; tbgarcia@ual.es; varizo@ucam.edu";"Arizo-Luque, Vanessa/J-2244-2016; Rodriguez, Diana Jimenez/AAC-7247-2021";"Arizo-Luque, Vanessa/0000-0002-0326-4576; Rodriguez, Diana Jimenez/0000-0002-1169-0428";NA;NA;NA;40;0;0;4;14;CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE;EDINBURGH;JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND;0260-6917;1532-2793;NA;NURS EDUC TODAY;Nurse Educ.

In this paper, we investigate the potential of gamification to foster knowledge retention using an action research approach. We present the results from a longitudinal study including 617 secondary and tertiary education students conducted over a period of two years. Various workshop designs that incorporated numerous gamification elements were compared with non-gamified workshop designs, tested and refined over time. The improved workshop designs led to increased levels of knowledge retention that exceeded the benchmark values from educational literature. We found that gamification exerts a positive impact on knowledge retention. We tested for the moderating effects of gender and age and found no effect of the former and inconsistent results for the latter.

The attendance of a course on medical terminology is mandatory for human and dental medicine students in Germany. Students' prerequisites when entering the course are diverse and the key learning objectives are achieved to a varying degree. Methods A new learning space, the TERMInator, was developed at the University Medicine Greifswald to meet the medical students' individual learning needs better. The interactive e-learning course serves as a supplement to the seminars, lectures and tutorials to rehearse and practically apply the course contents at an individual pace. It uses gamification elements and is supplied via the learning platform Moodle. The TERMInator was pilot implemented in two consecutive winter terms (2018/19, 2019/20) and comprehensively evaluated based on the general course evaluations and an anonymous questionnaire covering aspects of content, layout and user friendliness of the TERMInator and questions concerning the students' learning preferences. Results The TERMInator was rated very positively overall, which was also fed back to the lecturers during the classes. Students appreciate the new e-learning tool greatly and stress that the TERMInator should be further expanded. The handling of the TERMInator was considered to be very easy and, therefore, almost no training time was needed. The tasks were easy to understand and considered a good supplement to the seminar contents. The extent and quality of the images were seen rather critically. The students' learning strategies differ. Although e-learning options were generally rated as very important, student tutorials were considered by far the most important. Conclusions Medical terminology classes are characterised by heterogeneous learning groups and a high workload within a short time, which can lead to major challenges for the teaching staff. Complementary gamified e-learning tools are promising in view of the students' different knowledge levels and changing learning behaviour.;"[Seidlein, Anna-Henrikje; Bettin, Hartmut] Univ Med Greifswald, Inst Eth & Hist Med, Ellernholzstr 1-2, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany; [Franikowski, Philipp] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Psychol, Dept Gen Psychol 2, Franz Mehring Str 47, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany; [Salloch, Sabine] Hannover Med Sch, Inst Hist Eth & Philosophy Med, Carl Neuberg Str 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany";Salloch, S (corresponding author), Hannover Med Sch, Inst Hist Eth & Philosophy Med, Carl Neuberg Str 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany.;Salloch.Sabine@mh-hannover.de;NA;Franikowski, Philipp/0000-0002-2109-7388;"German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01PL17039]; Projekt DEAL";This project was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under grant number 01PL17039.

Following a design science research (DSR) method, we created a gamified, choose your own adventure style security education, training, and awareness (SETA) artefact using two formats: text and visual. Both artefacts were designed to identify the security threats that trainees are most susceptible to, debrief them about the threat and its potential consequences, and facilitate behaviour change by letting trainees re-evaluate their decisions. Using a longitudinal randomised controlled experiment, we compared these two artefacts to no intervention and traditional security warning emails by assessing both instrumental (changes in attitudes, intentions, and OSD behaviour) and experiential (memorability and user experience) outcomes. Our survey of 1,718 employees showed that the text-based artefact was better at improving instrumental outcomes, and the visual-based artefact was better at improving experiential outcomes. This study provides a more granular understanding of the linkages between technology artefacts and human experiences through the application of design science thinking. The findings contribute to DSR by developing design principles, testable propositions, and realistic performance evaluation metrics for gamified SETA artefacts, and present practical recommendations for regulating employees' information security and privacy behaviours inside and outside the workplace.;"[Dincelli, Ersin] Univ Colorado, Informat Syst, Denver, CO 80202 USA; [Chengalur-Smith, InduShobha] SUNY Albany, Informat Syst & Business Analyt, Albany, NY 12222 USA";Dincelli, E (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Informat Syst, Denver, CO 80202 USA.;ersin.dincelli@ucdenver.edu;NA;Dincelli, Ersin/0000-0002-8773-4714;Office of Research Services at the University of Colorado Denver;We are grateful for the research funding provided by the Office of Research Services at the University of Colorado Denver to support this study.

Information and communication technology (ICT)-mediated practice methods like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, gamification, and big data, among others, represent a new arena for social work practice. However, educators have been mostly inactive in developing curricula that support student knowledge, training, and decision-making on the adoption of technology for practice. In the United States, the Council on Social Work Education Futures Task Force highlighted this inaction as a matter of critical uncertainty for the field's future. In contrast, this paper describes how a school of social work rapidly deployed a free, CE training program on the basics of telebehavioral health practice to the social work community to aid their response to COVID-19. The rapid deployment of that training has been distilled as 'lessons learned' for those wanting to join in efforts to address the field's critical uncertainty regarding the adoption of technology. Information is presented about the reach of this training and includes feedback from participants.

Few patients persistently engage long-term to improve health outcomes, even when they are aware of the consequences of poor adherence. Despite the potential of mobile phone apps as a tool to manage medication adherence, there is still limited evidence of the impact of these innovative interventions. Real-world evidence can assist in minimizing this evidence gap. Objective: The objective of this study was to analyze the impact over time of a previously implemented digital therapeutic mobile app on medication adherence rates in adults with any chronic condition. Methods: A retrospective observational study was performed to assess the adherence rates of patients with any chronic condition using Perx Health, a digital therapeutic that uses multiple components within a mobile health app to improve medication adherence. These components include gamification, dosage reminders, incentives, educational components, and social community components. Adherence was measured through mobile direct observation of therapy (MDOT) over 3-month and 6-month time periods. Implementation adherence, defined as the percentage of doses in which the correct dose of a medication was taken, was assessed across the study periods, in addition to timing adherence or percentage of doses taken at the appropriate time (+/- 1 hour). The Friedman test was used to compare differences in adherence rates over time. Results: We analyzed 243 and 130 patients who used the app for 3 months and 6 months, respectively. The average age of the 243 patients was 43.8 years (SD 15.5), and 156 (64.2%) were female. The most common medications prescribed were varenicline, rosuvastatin, and cholecalciferol. The median implementation adherence was 96.6% (IQR 82.1%-100%) over 3 months and 96.8% (IQR 87.1%-100%) over 6 months Nonsignificant differences in adherence rates over time were observed in the 6-month analysis (Fr(2)=4.314, P=.505) and 3-month analysis (Fr(2)=0.635, P=.728). Similarly, the timing adherence analysis revealed stable trends with no significant changes over time. Conclusions: Retrospective analysis of users of a medication adherence management mobile app revealed a positive trend in maintaining optimal medication adherence over time. Mobile technology utilizing gamification, dosage reminders, incentives, education, and social community interventions appears to be a promising strategy to manage medication adherence in real practice.";"[Wiecek, Elyssa; Torres-Robles, Andrea; Cutler, Rachelle Louise; Garcia-Cardenas, Victoria] Univ Technol Sydney, Grad Sch Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Benrimoj, Shalom Isaac] Univ Granada, Pharmaceut Care Res Grp, Granada, Spain";Garcia-Cardenas, V (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Grad Sch Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;victoria.garciacardenas@uts.edu.au;"Garcia-Cardenas, Victoria/AAR-5039-2020; Cutler, Rachelle/E-6841-2017";"Garcia-Cardenas, Victoria/0000-0003-3770-4557; Torres Robles, Andrea Johanna/0000-0002-8751-5706; Benrimoj, Shalom ( charlie)/0000-0001-9768-7838; Cutler, Rachelle/0000-0002-3236-8366";NA;NA;NA;55;0;0;3;3;JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC;TORONTO;130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA;1438-8871;NA;NA;J MED INTERNET RES;J.

GAPc is an online active student-centered remedial teaching tool allowing prospective and enrolled students to electronically assess their knowledge of basic and advanced chemistry concepts via different game levels of expertise. This provides them with ways to correct potential shortcomings in view of academic education. A large number of exercises with different degrees of difficulty, links to additional sources of information, automated feedback, and the integrated grading center are key features of GAPc. Notwithstanding that GAPc is conceived as a distance learning and self-learning tool, it works equally well in a classroom setting. Indeed, GAPc was initially meant as a trajectory for precollege students to remediate their acquainted knowledge of chemistry by easy remote access. Today, on the Hasselt University Campus, GAPc is used in the chemistry summer school for senior high school students, and in chemistry courses for freshmen and sophomores enrolled in curricula with a major chemistry component.;"[Brassinne, Kristien; Reynders, Monique; Guedens, Wanda] Hasselt Univ, Fac Sci, BE-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Guedens, Wanda] Hasselt Univ, Biomol Design Grp, Inst Mat Res IMO, BE-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Coninx, Karin] Hasselt Univ, Expertise Ctr Digital Media EDM, BE-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium";"Guedens, W (corresponding author), Hasselt Univ, Fac Sci, BE-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium.; Guedens, W (corresponding author), Hasselt Univ, Biomol Design Grp, Inst Mat Res IMO, BE-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium.";wanda.guedens@uhasselt.be;NA;Brassinne, Kristien/0000-0001-9541-8802;NA;NA;NA;48;2;2;11;14;AMER CHEMICAL SOC;WASHINGTON;1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0021-9584;1938-1328;NA;J CHEM EDUC;J.

These fears lack a scientific basis, as role-playing games may be useful in education. Educational trends such as gamification are helping to change this perspective, incorporating elements of RPGs in applications like learning management systems (LMS), e.g., Classcraft. Given the increased research interest in this topic, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) report on the state-of-the-art related to RPGs in an Ibero-American education research context. In the study, a comprehensive search is carried out for the most relevant research papers indexed in Latindex, founded through the virtual repository Dialnet for papers between 2010 and 2019 in the field of education. The search chain was 'role-playing games', erasing those topics not related. Results show that there are several relevant references, even though they do not seem to have had a great impact.

Within this context, the aim of this research is to observe what effect the application of Flipped Classroom and gamification has in the development of motivation, autonomy and self-regulation towards learning through a didactic unit on healthy habits and diet in 202 students of 6th grade of Primary School from four different schools (public and state-subsidized) in the city of Granada (Spain). For this purpose, a methodological design was used with pre-test and post-test to check the effects of the experience on the students. The findings obtained showed that the application of these methods promoted an increase in students' motivation, as well as in their autonomy and self-regulation when facing the contents of the subject.

In academic contexts, this technology permits the superimposing of three-dimensional images onto the real environment. Although AR has been found to enhance learning in the academic environment, no systematic review of it has been conducted to identify, evaluate, and summarize empirical findings on its advantages and challenges in e-learning contexts. Hence, a systematic review of the research literature was conducted on the use of AR in e-learning contexts, with a focus on the key benefits and challenges related to its adoption and implementation. Electronic searches on databases, including Springer, Science Direct, EBSCO, and Google Scholar, were performed to retrieve relevant journal articles; 28 studies were included after they were screened using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The key benefits of using AR in e-learning included support of kinesthetic (tactile) learning, collaborative learning, distance/remote learning, learner-centered learning, and creative learning. Studies also reported that AR enhanced students' engagement, motivation, attention/focus, interactivity, verbal participation, concentration, knowledge retention, and spatial abilities, as well as information accessibility. The findings suggest that challenges associated with AR in e-learning include information and cognitive overload, lack of experience in using the technology, resistance from teachers, complex technology, costly technology, and technical issues, such as connectivity problems.";[Alzahrani, Nouf Matar] Albaha Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Albaha 42331, Saudi Arabia;Alzahrani, NM (corresponding author), Albaha Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Albaha 42331, Saudi Arabia.;noufalzahrani@bu.edu.sa;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;59;2;2;10;11;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2076-3417;NA;APPL SCI-BASEL;Appl.

Because of this, an educational program based on gamification has been designed considering the theoretical basis in this regard. The program has been designed to provide an alternative to the teaching practices common in many elementary classrooms, especially when the historical contents are taught. The aim of this research paper is to evaluate and validate the design of the gamified educational programme to develop historical thinking competencies in primary school students. The validation process was conducted by a panel of four experts experienced in the subject matter, Didactics of History and Social Sciences, completing a validated questionnaire with a 5-point Likert scale. It is a quantitative descriptive research and the results show that, although it is necessary to introduce some modifications to improve a few areas of the programme, the design is valid and highly appropriate. Therefore, the gamified educational programme can be implemented at school after making the necessary changes.;"[Martinez-Hita, Maria; Miralles-Martinez, Pedro] Univ Murcia, Murcia, Spain";Martinez-Hita, M (corresponding author), Univ Murcia, Murcia, Spain.;"m.martinezhita@um.es; pedromir@um.es";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;46;0;0;7;10;ASOC UNIV FORMACION PROFESORADO-AUFOP;ZARAGOZA;UNIV ZARAGOZA, FAC EDUC, PEDRO CERBUNA, 12, CAMPUS SAN FRANCISCO, ZARAGOZA, 50009, SPAIN;0213-8646;2530-3791;NA;REV INTERUNIV FORM P;Rev.

Design: Prospective, single-blinded, pilot, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Large university teaching hospital. Participants: Participants were anesthesiology residents on their cardiac anesthesiology rotation. Interventions: EchoEducator, a TEE image-based smartphone application of learning content through questions, was developed. Content was derived from the Examination of Special Competence in Basic Perioperative Transesophageal Echocardiography and the Objective Structured Clinical Examination portion of the APPLIED Examination and focused on identification of basic TEE views, cardiac structures, and pathology. Residents were randomly assigned to receive access to either the application or to standard intraoperative teaching. Thirty residents met inclusion criteria, and 18 residents completed the study. A pre-intervention assessment was given at the beginning of the rotation, and a post-intervention assessment was given after 2 weeks. Measurements: The primary outcome was the difference between the post-test score and the pre-test score. Standard bivariate statistics and the chi-square test were used for categorical variables, and the Student t test was used for continuous variables. Tests were 2-sided, and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The intervention group demonstrated a greater increase in score; (+19.19% [95% confidence interval 4.14%-34.24%]; p = 0.02) compared with the control group. Conclusions: This study supports the hypothesis that use of a smartphone-based asynchronous educational application improves TEE knowledge compared with traditional modalities alone. This supports an opportunity to improve medical education by expanding the role of web-based asynchronous learning. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

As a key risk mitigation policy, organisations are investing in professional training courses for their employees to raise awareness on cyber attacks and related defences. Serious games have emerged as a new approach that can complement instruction-led or computer-based security training by providing a fun environment where players learn and practice cyber security concepts through the game. In this paper we propose Riskio, a tabletop game to increase cyber security awareness for people with no-technical background working in organisations. Riskio provides an active learning environment where players build knowledge on cyber security attacks and defences by playing both the role of the attacker and the defender of critical assets in a fictitious organisation.

Educational researchers and practitioners both struggle with identifying when, where, and how to use gamification design concepts. The present study provides findings from a meta-analysis that integrated the empirical, quantitative research on gamification in formal educational settings on student learning outcomes. This was achieved by examining the overall effect size, identifying which gamification design elements (e.g., badges) were used, and determining under what circumstances (e.g., engineering education) gamification works. The final corpus of data included 30 independent studies and associated effect sizes comparing gamification to non-gamification conditions while accounting forN = 3083 participants. The overall effect size using a random-effects model isg = .464 [.244 to .684] in favor of the gamification condition, which is a small to medium effect size. We examined 14 different gamification design elements (e.g., leaderboards) and showed that each leads to different effects on student learning outcomes. Further, the type of publication (e.g., journal article), student classification (e.g., undergraduate), and subject area (e.g., mathematics) are also investigated as moderators.

This paper presents the results of a training program with future Primary Education teachers using gamification and flipped-classroom strategies and techniques. The aim was that teachers in training acquire competences in proposing innovative teaching units. The learning achieved through the program was evaluated by collecting perceptions via a questionnaire and using an observation scale of the didactic units designed. The program was implemented in four classroom groups (N = 210) at the University of Murcia (Spain). Descriptive statistics are shown; mean tests (t of Student and ANOVA of one factor); non-parametric tests (U-Mann Whitney test); and Pearson correlations between subscales.

Oral health care education is a public health priority as the maintenance of oral hygiene is integral to overall health Maintaining optimal oral hygiene among children is challenging and can be supported by using relevant motivational approaches. Objective: The primary aim of this study was to identify mobile smartphone apps that include gamification features focused on motivating children to learn, perform, and maintain optimal oral hygiene. Methods: We searched six online app stores using four search terms (oral hygiene game, oral hygiene gamification, oral hygiene brush game, and oral hygiene brush gamification). We identified gamification features, identified whether apps were consistent with evidence-based dentistry, performed a quality appraisal with the Mobile App Rating Scale user version (uMARS), and quantified behavior scores (Behavior Change score, uMARS score, and Coventry, Aberdeen, and London-Refined [CALO-RE] score) using three different instruments that measure behavior change. Results: Of 612 potentially relevant apps included in the analysis, 17 met the inclusion criteria. On average, apps included 6.87 (SD 4.18) out of 31 possible gamification features. The most frequently used gamification features were time pressure (16/17, 94%), virtual characters (14/17, 82%), and fantasy (13/17, 76%). The most common oral hygiene evidence-based recommendation was brushing time (2-3 minutes), which was identified in 94% (16/17) of apps. The overall mean uMARS score for app quality was high (4.30, SD 0.36), with good mean subjective quality (3.79, SD 0.71) and perceived impact (3.58, SD 0.44). Sufficient behavior change techniques based on three taxonomies were detected in each app. Conclusions: The majority of the analyzed oral hygiene apps included gamification features and behavior change techniques to perform and maintain oral hygiene in children. Overall, the apps contained some educational content consistent with evidence-based dentistry and high-quality background for oral self-care in children; however, there is scope for improvement.";"[Fijacko, Nino; Gosak, Lucija; Cilar, Leona; Stiglic, Gregor] Univ Maribor, Fac Hlth Sci, Zitna 15, Maribor, Slovenia; [Novsak, Alenka] Dr Novsak Storitve Doo, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Creber, Ruth Masterson] Weill Cornell Med, Div Hlth Informat, Healthcare Policy & Res, New York, NY USA; [Skok, Pavel] Univ Maribor, Med Fac, Maribor, Slovenia; [Stiglic, Gregor] Univ Maribor, Fac Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Maribor, Slovenia";Fijacko, N (corresponding author), Univ Maribor, Fac Hlth Sci, Zitna 15, Maribor, Slovenia.;nino.fijacko@um.si;"Fijacko, Nino/ABI-2409-2020; Stiglic, Gregor/E-5286-2011; Creber, Ruth Masterson/AAQ-7288-2020; Fijacko, Nino/ABI-2948-2020; Cilar, Leona/Z-3371-2019";"Fijacko, Nino/0000-0003-2722-0049; Stiglic, Gregor/0000-0002-0183-8679; Creber, Ruth Masterson/0000-0002-4238-9902; Cilar, Leona/0000-0002-6842-7751";"knowledge through creative pathways 2016-2020 scheme - European Union from the European Social Fund; Republic of Slovenia; Slovenian Research AgencySlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia [N2-0101, P2-0057]; NIH/National Institute of Nursing ResearchUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) [R00NR016275]";This study was partially supported by the knowledge through creative pathways 2016-2020 scheme cofunded by the European Union from the European Social Fund and the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovenian Research Agency (grant numbers N2-0101 and P2-0057).

They also help practice other 21 century skills such as computational thinking, problem solving and teamwork. Unfortunately, learning how to program is tough and can be also frustrating for beginner students. In this work we introduce RoboTIC, a serious game based on gamification and Augmented Reality that facilitates the learning of programming to students in lower levels of the education system by using a novel set of visual metaphors derived from a notation of roads and traffic signs. The architecture that supports RoboTIC has been designed to allow the integration of multimedia components when new programming concepts and techniques must be addressed and to add game levels that enable students to learn incrementally. Experiments have been conducted in a youth center with children who do not have coding skills at all to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal.

The process of creating a gamified system and its influence on human behavior reflect the interaction between educators and machines. Objective: The purpose of this pilot study was to present Ethoshunt as a gamification-based mobile app that can be used in teaching and learning ethics. Methods: This study involved a mixed-methods research design. The researchers surveyed 39 undergraduate students who were introduced to Ethoshunt in order to examine the relationships between mobile app usability and positive emotions, ethical competency, and user experience. Affinity diagramming was used as a tool to organize the opinions and experiences of participants using featured gamification elements. Results: Game dynamics and game mechanics explained the functionality of Ethoshunt. In addition, the learning flow through Ethoshunt was discussed. Overall, the findings were positive, and mobile app usability had the strongest relationship with positive emotions (r=0.744, P<.001), followed by ethical competency (r=0.686, P<.001) and user experience (r=0.614, P<.001). Conclusions: Positive emotions could be perceived as an important dimension in the development and usability of Ethoshunt. The researchers suggest that the gamification-based mobile app advocated in this study may provide ideas for ethics educators who wish to develop a technology-mediated learning environment.;"[Zakaria, Noor Syamilah; Subarimaniam, Neerushah] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Educ Studies, Dept Counselor Educ & Counseling Psychol, Upm Serdang 43400, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Saripan, M.

However, in Colombia, according to the results of the Saber tests, the development of these competencies is still deficient, and the problem is especially acute in virtual education, since students lose their motivation to learn more easily. A gamma tool that allows increasing such motivational levels while teaching about citizenship competencies is a solution proposed by a team of Colombian researchers. This paper presents a prioritization exercise that allowed the project team to select, using a formal prioritization method, those priority competencies to be gammatized. The method used involved the design of data collection instruments, consultation with experts using the Delphi method, conducting focus groups, calculating results by quartiles and validating and contrasting final results. The results indicate that, in this particular context of gamification and virtual education, the communicative type of citizen competencies, specifically the writing competencies, together with the cognitive type of citizen competencies are the most relevant.;"[Camila Paba-Medina, Maira; Katherin Acosta-Medina, Julieth; Liliana Torres-Barreto, Martha] Univ Ind Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia";Paba-Medina, MC (corresponding author), Univ Ind Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia.;"maira.paba@correo.uis.edu.co; Julieth.acosta1@correo.uis.edu.co; mltorres@uis.edu.co";Medina, Julieth Katherin Acosta/AAC-6441-2021;Medina, Julieth Katherin Acosta/0000-0001-6910-069X;NA;NA;NA;39;0;0;0;0;INST UNIV POLITECNICO GRANCOLOMBIANO;BOGOTA;CALLE 57 NUMERO 3-00 ESTE BLOQUE A, PRIMER PISO, BOGOTA, 00000, COLOMBIA;1909-7433;2145-308X;NA;PANORAMA;Panarama;JUL-DEC;2020;14;27;NA;NA;NA;NA;51;70;NA;10.15765/pnrm.v14i27.1522;NA;NA;20;Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary;Social Sciences - Other Topics;OX4XX;WOS:000593570400004;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

First, we designed and developed an immersive VR experience which included a lecture and a lab. Next, we tested it with (n = 57) participants in a controlled experiment where they were randomly assigned to a VR group or a physical group. Both groups were subjected to the same lecture and lab, but one was in VR and the other was in the real world. We collected pre- and post-test results to assess the participants' knowledge in DF concepts learned. Our experimental results indicated no significant differences in scores between the immersive VR group and the physical group. However, our results showed faster completion times in VR by the participants, which hints at VR being more time efficient, as virtual environments can be spun programmatically with little downtime.

To engage and motivate students to quiz each other, and as a side effect, build a question bank, as well as to study the gaming and learning behavior of students, we used a peer-quizzing game called Tower of Questions (ToQ). The game uses some themes and mechanics found in tower defense (TD) games. The students received points for posing and answering the questions in the game in the form of gems. Students played the game with pseudonyms for one academic term and were told not to disclose their identities to anyone. We conducted a 3-month long study for two consecutive years in the same first-year undergraduate computer science course.

In virtual learning environments, knowledge and the appropriate use of ICT are very important to ensure effective teaching-learning processes. One of the emerging methodologies in this regard is the use of gamification in education. Gamification motivates students' when they are faced with complex problems contextualized in a professional setting and provides them training in the skills required for entry into the world of work. The objective of this article is to measure factors that influence a gamified experience. To this end, a quantitative study with an ex post-facto descriptive analysis was carried out. The study population comprised 238 participants: 50 teachers and 188 students from different degree programs at universities in Andalusia, Spain. The results revealed high levels of activation and creative thinking, indicating that both students and teachers achieve high levels of motivation, activation and creativity after gamified experiences.;"[Elena Parra-Gonzalez, Ma; Segura-Robles, Adrian] Univ Granada, Granada, Spain; [Romero-Garcia, Carmen] Univ Int la Rioja, Logrono, La Rioja, Spain";Parra-Gonzalez, ME (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Granada, Spain.;"elenaparra@ugr.es; adrianseg@ugr.es; mariadelcarmen.romero@unir.net";Romero-Garcia, Carmen/AAH-6935-2020;NA;NA;NA;NA;54;1;1;6;7;UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA;BARCELONA;SERVEI PUBLICACIONS, EDIFICI A, BELLATERRA, CARDANYOLA DEL VALLES, BARCELONA, 08193, SPAIN;0211-819X;2014-8801;NA;EDUCAR;Educar;JUL-DEC;2020;56;2;NA;NA;NA;NA;475;489;NA;10.5565/rev/educar.1104;NA;NA;15;Education & Educational Research;Education & Educational Research;MZ6JJ;WOS:000559232400014;NA;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

This study developed a prototype for a virtual laboratory for powder-bed binder jetting three-dimensional printing (3DP) training in universities. The 3DP virtual laboratory is expected to address problems encountered in teaching, training, and practicing with powder-bed binder jetting 3DP. The 3DP Training Virtual Laboratory was developed by using immersive VR technology to simulate two-handed operations. The user evaluation of the first version prototype revealed that the students lacked learning interest and motivation when using the prototype. Thus, gamification technology was integrated into the 3DP virtual laboratory prototype in the mid-implementation development phase. After refining and systematically developing the model to meet the modified requirements, user evaluations on the game elements showed positive feedback. This study concluded that elements of gamification design should be considered at the beginning of the educational or training system development in order to enhance students' motivation or engagement.;[Chen, Pai-Hsun] Nan Kai Univ Technol, Dept Multimedia Animat & Applicat, Caotun 542, Nantou, Taiwan;Chen, PH (corresponding author), Nan Kai Univ Technol, Dept Multimedia Animat & Applicat, Caotun 542, Nantou, Taiwan.;bhc@mail.nkut.edu.tw;Chen, Pai-Hsun/AAL-2515-2021;Chen, Pai-Hsun/0000-0002-2684-6739;Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [MOST 10802635-E-252-001];This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China under contract number MOST 10802635-E-252-001.;NA;33;0;0;7;10;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2227-7102;NA;EDUC SCI;Educ.

One of the strategies to apply gamification in the classroom is the use of the escape room. In this work different experiences of escape room in the context of formal university education are analysed. The analysis of students' opinions shows that such activities are well received regardless of background (engineering or education) or gender. The emotions that arise from the experience are mostly positive and the students state that they have developed both specific and transversal competencies.

The way in which preservice science teachers prepare to practice one's profession, approach to some concepts, events or phenomena can be determined effectively through metaphors. This research's aim is to determine the approaches of preservice science teachers about physics that they have difficulty in understanding and physics problem solving that they have difficulty in solving through metaphors. The participants of the research are comprised of 139 students who are studying in different classes in the science teacher education program at the Faculty of Education at a university in the Eastern Black Sea Region. In the pattern of phenomenology, the data were collected through a questionnaire and have been subjected to content analysis by NVivo 11 program. Generated metaphors are generally grouped under the headings nature, benefits and needs. It has been found that the codes often emphasize the link between physics and daily life, difficulty, combining different kinds of knowledge and skills, and relation with logic. Some of the results reached are those: Even though preservice teachers associate physics and physics problems with life, they remember the solution process of routine physics problems when they face with a physics problem. They have difficulties in understanding physics and solving physics problems, and think that solving physics problems probably depends on combining information in a related way. Related to these results, suggestions such as giving different types of problems in physics lessons, gamification the physics teaching, adding a lesson about physics problem solving strategies have been offered.;"[Eryilmaz Toksoy, Seyhan] Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Egitim Fak, Bilgisayar & Ogretim Teknol Egitimi Bolumu, Rize, Turkey; [Akdeniz, Ali Riza] Trabzon Univ, Fatih Egitim Fak, Matemat & Fen Bilimleri Egitimi Bolumu, Fizik Egitimi ABD, Trabzon, Turkey";Eryilmaz Toksoy, S (corresponding author), Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Egitim Fak, Bilgisayar & Ogretim Teknol Egitimi Bolumu, Rize, Turkey.;"seyhan.eryilmaz@erdogan.edu.tr; arakdeniz@gmail.com";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;79;0;0;2;2;HACETTEPE UNIV;ANKARA;HACETTEPE UNIV, ANKARA, 6532, TURKEY;2536-4758;NA;NA;HACET UNIV EGIT FAK;Hacet.

With the advent of smart manufacturing technologies-better production equipment, sensing technologies, computational methods, and data analytics applied from the process to enterprise levels-the potential for sustainability performance improvement is tremendous. Sustainable manufacturing seeks the best balance of a variety of performance measures to satisfy and optimize the goals of all stakeholders. Accurate measures of performance are the foundation on which sustainability objectives can be pursued. Historically, operational and information technologies have undergone disparate development, with little convergence across the domains. To focus future research efforts in advanced manufacturing, the authors organized a one-day workshop, sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation, at the joint manufacturing research conferences of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Research needs were identified to help harmonize disparate manufacturing metrics, models, and methods from across conventional manufacturing, nanomanufacturing, and additive/hybrid manufacturing processes and systems. Experts from academia and government labs presented invited lightning talks to discuss their perspectives on current advanced manufacturing research challenges. Workshop participants also provided their perspectives in facilitated brainstorming breakouts and a reflection activity. The aim was to define advanced manufacturing research and educational needs for improving manufacturing process performance through improved sustainability metrics, modeling approaches, and decision support methods. In addition to these workshop outcomes, a review of the recent literature is presented, which identifies research opportunities across several advanced manufacturing domains. Recommendations for future research describe the short-, mid-, and long-term needs of the advanced manufacturing community for enabling smart and sustainable manufacturing.;"[Raman, Arvind Shankar; Haapala, Karl R.; Raoufi, Kamyar] Oregon State Univ, Sch Mech Ind & Mfg Engn, 200 SW Monroe Ave, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Linke, Barbara S.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bernstein, William Z.; Morris, K.

Digital badges represent an innovative instruction strategy involving the credentialing of competencies to provide evidence for achievement. Despite increasing interest in digital badges, there has been no synthesis of the health care education literature regarding this credentialing strategy. The present authors proposed to address this gap by conducting the first systematic review of digital badges in health care education, to reveal pedagogical and research limitations, and to provide an evidence-based foundation for the design and implementation of digital badges. Methods A systematic search of the medical education literature from January 2008 to March 2019 was conducted using MEDLINE, Web of Science, CAB s and ScienceDirect. Included studies described digital badges in academic or professional medical education programmes in any health care profession. Included studies were appraised and quality assessment, methodological scoring, quantitative analysis and thematic extraction were conducted. Results A total of 1050 relevant records were screened for inclusion; 201 full text articles were then assessed for eligibility, which resulted in the identification of 30 independent papers for analysis. All records had been published since 2013; 77% were journal articles, and 83% involved academic health care education programmes. Scores for quality were relatively moderate. Thematic analyses revealed implications for the design and implementation of digital badges: learner characteristics may moderate student outcomes; the novelty effect can negate the value of digital badges, and educators may overcome instruction-related challenges with digital badges using design and implementation strategies such as the creation of badging ecosystems. Conclusions The results indicate a growing momentum for the use of digital badges as an innovative instruction and credentialing strategy within higher education and provide evidence for outcomes within a learner-centred, competency-based model of medical education. There is a paucity of research to support the design and implementation of this credentialing system in health care education. The potential benefits necessitate future high-quality analyses reporting institutional, patient and workplace-based outcomes to evaluate the effectiveness and moderating conditions of digital badges.";"[Noyes, Julie A.; Johnson, Jason W.] Lincoln Mem Univ Harrogate, Coll Vet Med, Dept Clin Sci, Harrogate, TN USA; [Noyes, Julie A.; Welch, Patrick M.] Ethos Vet Hlth, Vetbloom, Woburn, MA USA; [Noyes, Julie A.] Amer Anim Hosp Assoc, Lakewood, CO USA; [Noyes, Julie A.] Washington State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Dept Vet Clin Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Carbonneau, Kira J.] Washington State Univ, Coll Educ, Dept Kinesiol & Educ Psychol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA";Noyes, JA (corresponding author), 5528 Continental Dr, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.;dr.julienoyes@gmail.com;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;86;5;5;4;13;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0308-0110;1365-2923;NA;MED EDUC;Med.

PPM instructors have been largely unable to transform what is being taught into applicable skills. Gamification has been successfully applied in some educational environments and it has been increasingly applied in Management university courses. The objective of this study is to propose and assess a gamified strategy for teaching Project Portfolio Management to MBA students. The implementation of this gamified experience was carried out in 2018, 2019 and 2020 with 122 students. They were quite satisfied with the gamified experience and recognized that the Portfolio Game Experience contributed to learning different PPM techniques and processes, especially those associated with project prioritization and selection. Moreover, 100% of the respondents would recommend the course to a colleague. By qualitatively analyzing students' feedback, this study has found out that the Portfolio Game Experience provided the students the practical experience of actively learning what they have seen in theory. Students also highlighted typical game characteristics that contribute to their learning, like the fact that the game is fun, challenging, motivating and interactive.

Therefore, game-based approaches are unsurprisingly used for learning achievement. In this study, a game-based learning courseware was implemented using a problem-based strategy. For this purpose, a game known as 'Programmer Adventure Land' was designed and developed. A group of college students were asked to play the game to improve their knowledge of computer programming. Results indicated that the problem-based learning approach of the game can enhance the satisfaction, enjoyment, motivation, and user interface for the problem-based game learning courseware.

Firstly, this research aims at helping countries implement an equitable, innovative and context-appropriate stay-home game plan for the millions of disadvantaged and under-privileged students severely affected by the forfeiture of school closures; and secondly, this study proclaims that the burgeoning popularity of gamification has the potential to lay the bedrock foundation for 'Literacy in the New Norm'. Design/methodology/approach - The temporal closure of schools around the world to limit the spread of the COVID-19 has resulted in massive educational disruptions triggering adverse effects and bringing much of education under grave threat. Through a review of the current empirical and conceptual literature, this study proposes a new gamification concept in a non-technology environment. Findings - Well underway are global dialogues that hold conversations on implementing mitigation strategies to counter the looming global health crisis. This has generated the impetus for a more concerted effort by concerned governments and international organizations to identify appropriate solutions for the continuity of learning so that the learning never stops. While educators and learners plunge further into the core of reconstructing education, the authors recognize that the fundamentals of technology and virtual connectivity have all along contributed to the multi-faceted e-learning stage set. However, concerns regarding the paradigm shift to remote online learning would certainly exacerbate inequalities cardinally felt across disadvantaged communities around the globe. Originality/value - As the world is currently bound by strict isolation measures, learners of all ages have been relegated to the confines of their homes. For the most part, the stark realities of technological mishaps that have befallen underprivileged school children, serve as a reminder to help target children all over the world who are in most peril of losing ground in terms of continued education. It is on these grounds that the criterion set out in this article elucidates the nature and scope of a supplementary stay-home game plan detailing the use of game affordances that bear intelligently in the creation of home-based activities for parents to give it their best effort in fostering a collaborative and meaningful parent-child relationship that spawns the new language of literacy in the new norm.";"[Zainuddin, Zamzami] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zainuddin, Zamzami] Sekolah Tinggi Ilmu Adm Nas, Dept Publ Adm, Lhokseumawe, Indonesia; [Perera, Corinne Jacqueline] Shangrao Normal Univ, Fac Educ & Sci, Shangrao, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Haruna, Hussein] Tecnol Monterrey, Writing Lab, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Habiburrahim, Habiburrahim] Univ Islam Negeri Ar Raniry, Fac Educ, Banda Aceh, Indonesia";"Zainuddin, Z (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.; Zainuddin, Z (corresponding author), Sekolah Tinggi Ilmu Adm Nas, Dept Publ Adm, Lhokseumawe, Indonesia.";"zamzami.hku@gmail.com; jacquelineperera@gmail.com; hharuna@tec.mx; habib.habiburrahim@fulbrightmail.org";"Zainuddin, Zamzami/F-1625-2018; Habiburrahim, Habiburrahim/D-6316-2018; Zainuddin, Zamzami/E-8624-2015; Habiburrahim, Habiburrahim/AAU-7335-2020; Zainuddin, Zamzami/AAB-7135-2021";"Zainuddin, Zamzami/0000-0001-6436-4469; Habiburrahim, Habiburrahim/0000-0002-9070-3046; Zainuddin, Zamzami/0000-0002-4851-4102; Habiburrahim, Habiburrahim/0000-0002-9070-3046; Zainuddin, Zamzami/0000-0002-4851-4102";NA;NA;NA;38;1;1;5;7;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2398-5348;1758-6909;NA;INFORM LEARN SCI;Inf.

Most participants showed interest in gamification and indicated that they would consider utilizing gaming elements in their future MOOCs. Interestingly, they wanted to gamify their MOOCs mostly to increase social interactions and student retention. Significant differences in self-efficacy and perceptions of gamification were found between younger participants and older participants. The results also revealed significant differences in interest and self-efficacy between participants with prior experience with gamification and those without prior experience. The major barriers to gamifying MOOCs included lack of time, limited knowledge, lack of funding, lack of fit between gamification and the course content, concerns about students' perceptions of gamification, and concerns regarding the negative effects of gamification. Participants reported that they would need time and funding, guidance from gamification experts, examples of gamified MOOCs, more flexible MOOC platforms in order to successfully gamify their MOOCs.;"[An, Yunjo; Lin, Lin] Univ North Texas, Dept Learning Technol, 3940 N Elm St, Denton, TX 76207 USA; [Zhu, Meina] Wayne State Univ, Learning Design & Technol Program, 42 W Warren Ave, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Bonk, Curtis J.] Indiana Univ, Instruct Syst Technol Dept, 201 N Rose Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA";An, YJ (corresponding author), Univ North Texas, Dept Learning Technol, 3940 N Elm St, Denton, TX 76207 USA.;"Yunjo.An@unt.edu; meinazhu@wayne.edu; cjbonk@indiana.edu; Lin.Lin@unt.edu";NA;Lin, Lin/0000-0002-9630-9744;NA;NA;NA;54;0;0;8;22;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1042-1726;1867-1233;NA;J COMPUT HIGH EDUC;J.

While traditional face-to-face interaction is still the norm, mobile, online and virtual augmentations are increasingly adopted worldwide. Moreover, with the advent of gaming technology besides the 3D visual paradigm, the touch and feel paradigm is slowly taking its place in the user interface design through gamification. While haptic (force feedback) devices were barely available a decade ago outside research laboratories, the rapid rise in gaming technology has driven the cost significantly lower enabling the spread of these devices in many households and the wide public. This article presents a novel haptic-based training tool implemented as a gaming scenario to assist students in learning of abstract concepts in Physics. The focus is on electromagnetism as one of the fundamental forces in nature and specifically the abstractions used as building blocks around the Lorentz force. Experimental results suggest that by introducing well designed visual-haptic interfaces in presenting abstract concepts, students become better engaged in the classrooms and superior learning outcomes can be achieved.;"[Hamza-Lup, Felix G.] Georgia Southern Univ, Comp Sci, Savannah, GA 31419 USA; [Goldbach, Ioana R.] Valahia Univ Targoviste, Management & Mkt, Targoviste, Romania";Hamza-Lup, FG (corresponding author), Georgia Southern Univ, Comp Sci, Savannah, GA 31419 USA.;"fhamzalup@georgiasouthern.edu; ioana.goldbach@icstm.ro";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;38;1;1;3;3;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1783-7677;1783-8738;NA;J MULTIMODAL USER IN;J.

We analyzed a total of 53 papers from 2010 to 2019 using qualitative analysis with complementary descriptive quantitative analysis. Our findings revealed three main AR learning activities: word spelling games, word knowledge activities, and location-based word activities. Our findings also uncovered five main design strategies: three-dimensional multimedia content, hands-on interaction with physical learning materials, gamification, spatial mappings, and location-based features. Several combinations of design and instructional strategies tended to be effective: Learning gains were enhanced by using three-dimensional multimedia with advanced organizers (presentation strategy) and/or using location-based content with learners' self-exploration (discovery strategy); and motivation was enhanced by using game mechanisms with discovery strategy. We suggest that future designers of AR early language applications should move beyond these basic approaches and consider how unique benefits of AR may be applied to support key activities in early language learning while also considering how to support sociotechnical factors such as collaboration between teachers and learners and different learning contexts.

This study aims to analyze the effectiveness of innovative mixed practices, combining gamification and flipped learning in the subject of Spanish Language and Literature against the isolated use of flipped learning. For this, a quasi-experimental design of descriptive and correlational type, based on a quantitative methodology has been carried out. For its development, two study groups (control-experimental) have been set up. The selected sample is of an intentional nature and was composed of 60 students of the fourth year of Secondary Education of an educational center in Southern Spain. The data has been collected through a validated questionnaire. The results determine that the complement of gamification in flipped learning has led to improvements in various academic indicators. It is concluded that the development of gamified actions in the face-to-face phase of flipped learning improves the motivation, interaction with teachers, and interactions of students.;"[Lopez Belmonte, Jesus] Univ Granada, Dept Didact, Granada 18071, Spain; Univ Granada, Sch Org, Granada 18071, Spain";Belmonte, JL (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Didact, Granada 18071, Spain.;"santiagopozo@correo.ugr.es; jesuslopez@ugr.es; arturofuentes@ugr.es; juanlope@ugr.es";NA;"Lopez Belmonte, Jesus/0000-0003-0823-3370; Pozo Sanchez, Santiago/0000-0001-8125-4990; Lopez Nunez, Juan Antonio/0000-0001-9881-9169";NA;NA;NA;85;8;8;3;3;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2414-4088;NA;MULTIMODAL TECHNOLOG;Multimodal Technol.

A sedentary lifestyle can be the risk factor for noncommunicable diseases (NCD) or premature death all over the world. Several studies demonstrate that school-based physical activity promotion is an important solution to make healthy behaviors, especially in children and adolescents. In this vein, the current research evaluates a model for physical activity, which is promoted through a game among high school students. Methods: In this study, 47 high school's 10th-grade boys from Tehran were requited. The game scenario included the suggestion of some behaviors which can increase daily physical activity by each student, like or dislike each behavior by other students, counting likes, selecting the most-liked behaviors, and rewarding their proposers. After a week, the behavioral recall was assessed and compared with a control group who had been heard these behaviors in the class without gamification. Results: The participants in the game could recall physical activity behaviors significantly more than peers in the control group. Conclusions: The findings show gamification could significantly improve the effectiveness of education for normal behaviors in physical activity.;"[Pourabbasi, Ata; Nouriyengejeh, Sara] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Endocrinol & Metab Clin Sci Inst, Endocrinol & Metab Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Amirkhani, Manzar] Islamic Azad Univ, Tonekabon Branch, Fac Educ Sci, Counseling Dept, Mazandaran, Iran";Pourabbasi, A (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Endocrinol & Metab Clin Sci Inst, Endocrinol & Metab Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran.;atapoura@gmail.com;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;31;0;0;0;1;WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS;MUMBAI;WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, 400059, INDIA;2008-7802;2008-8213;NA;INT J PREVENTIVE MED;Int.

The research was carried out in the training of future teachers specialising in physical education during two academic courses. In total, 127 students participated in the study, divided into a gamified experimental group (n= 62) and a control group (n= 65). The participants completed a questionnaire to assess motivation in physical education before and after the intervention and performed a final exam to assess academic performance. The results indicated an increase in external regulation in the experimental group only. Furthermore, this group achieved significantly better academic performance. The findings of this study suggest that gamified implementation is beneficial for academic performance at the university stage, even though intrinsic motivation does not change. Furthermore, the nature of rewards or punishments, as characteristic of this pedagogical approach, could play an important role in the expected results, since external regulation increased significantly after the intervention.;"[Ferriz-Valero, Alberto; Garcia Martinez, Salvador; Garcia-Jaen, Miguel] Univ Alicante, Dept Gen & Specif Didact, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Spain; [Ferriz-Valero, Alberto; Garcia Martinez, Salvador; Garcia-Jaen, Miguel] Univ Alicante, Dept Gen & Specif Didact, Res Grp Phys Educ Fitness & Performance, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Spain; [Ferriz-Valero, Alberto; Osterlie, Ove; Garcia Martinez, Salvador; Garcia-Jaen, Miguel] NTNU Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Res Grp DiTePES Digital Technol Phys Educ & Sport, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Osterlie, Ove] NTNU Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Social & Educ Sci, Dept Teacher Educ, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway";"Ferriz-Valero, A; Garcia-Jaen, M (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Gen & Specif Didact, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Spain.; Ferriz-Valero, A; Garcia-Jaen, M (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Gen & Specif Didact, Res Grp Phys Educ Fitness & Performance, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Spain.; Ferriz-Valero, A; Garcia-Jaen, M (corresponding author), NTNU Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Res Grp DiTePES Digital Technol Phys Educ & Sport, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.";"alberto.ferriz@ua.es; ove.osterlie@ntnu.no; salvador.garcia@ua.es; m.garciajaen@ua.es";NA;"Ferriz Valero, Alberto/0000-0001-8206-4152; Osterlie, Ove/0000-0002-7008-6642; Garcia-Jaen, Miguel/0000-0002-4658-1432";University of Alicante [XARXES-I3CE-2018-4416];This research was funded by the University of Alicante, grant number XARXES-I3CE-2018-4416.;NA;63;6;6;6;10;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;1660-4601;NA;INT J ENV RES PUB HE;Int.

This methodology has recently revealed itself as one of the most efficient teaching methodologies in the student body, proving useful at all educational levels. One of the most frequently mentioned properties is its ability to reset the student's attention clock: the key is collective learning, an attractive way of remembering new content. The experience described below has been developed in the context of a generalist university in two very different degrees: Degree in Teacher Training and Degree in Computer Engineering. To develop the theoretical sessions, the master class was combined with the use of the Kahoot tool. The observations made by the teachers in relation to the dynamics of the theoretical classes show that the use of Kahoot at the end of the theoretical sessions increased the students' attendance at class, in addition to their involvement in the sessions and they kept their attention for longer.

Scholars and practitioners in the field of education call for innovative ways of engaging youth-a reason why gamification has gained more attention in recent years. This paper aims at exploring the role of gamification in affecting pro-environmental behavioral change and searching for best practices for educational purposes. For that aim, pro-environmental gamification platforms are identified and analyzed by applying two different frameworks: the Octalysis Framework and the Climate Change Engagement through Games Framework. After scanning 181 cases, a final sample of six is analyzed and two of them are selected as best practices with higher potential to engage users in pro-environmental behavioral change: SaveOhno and JouleBug. Meaning, ownership, and social influence, as well as achievability, challenge, and credibility, are seen as core elements that can increase the success of gamification platforms. In conclusion, the more attributes are enclosed in the gamification design, the stronger physical and mental connections it builds up with participants. Insights from this study can help educators to select best practices and gamification designers to better influence behavioral change through game mechanics.;"[Ouariachi, Tania; Li, Chih-Yen; Elving, Wim J.

In fact, gamification has attracted considerable controversy (gamification is bullshit') and some derogatory labels such as exploitationware. Therefore, in order to make the case for or against gamification in education, it is important to examine the effects (if any) of gamification on student learning achievements. This study is a meta-analysis of 30 independent interventions (3,202 participants) drawn from 24 quantitative studies that have examined the effects of gamification on student academic performance in various educational settings. The results show an overall significant medium effect size in favor of gamification over learning without gamification (Hedges' g = 0.504, 95% CI [0.284-0.723], p < 0.001). No publication bias is detected. An analysis of 32 qualitative studies reveals four reasons for learners' enjoyment of gamification: (a) gamification can foster enthusiasm; (b) gamification can provide feedback on performance; (c) gamification can fulfill learners' needs for recognition; and (d) gamification can promote goal setting, and two reasons for their dislike of gamification: (a) gamification does not bring additional utility and (b) gamification can cause anxiety or jealousy. We conclude by highlighting two unresolved questions, and suggesting several future research directions concerning gamification in educational contexts.";"[Bai, Shurui; Hew, Khe Foon; Huang, Biyun] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China";Hew, KF (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Ctr Informat Technol Educ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;kfhew@hku.hk;"Huang, Lucy/ABA-6040-2020; Hew, Khe/ABB-1737-2020";Hew, Khe/0000-0003-4149-533X;NA;NA;NA;155;14;14;27;54;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;1747-938X;1878-0385;NA;EDUC RES REV-NETH;Educ.

Research was conducted in two groups of 131 high school students in Poland. In each school, the research sample was divided into experimental and control groups. Each group was taught by the same teacher and participated in the same courses and tests before the game. Just after finishing the course on waves and vibrations (school 1) and optics (school 2), experimental groups took part in a group board game to assess their knowledge. One week after the game, the experimental and control groups (not involved in the game) took part in the post-tests. Students from the experimental groups performed better in the game than in the tests given before the game. As well their results in the post-tests were significantly higher statistically than students from the control groups. Simultaneously, student's opinions in the experimental groups about the board game as an assessment method were collected in an open-descriptive form and in a short questionnaire, and analyzed. Results showed that students experienced a positive attitude toward the assessment method, a reduction of test anxiety and an increase in their motivation for learning.;"[Dziob, Daniel] Jagiellonian Univ, Smoluchowski Inst Phys, Lojasiewicza 11, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland; [Dziob, Daniel] Jagiellonian Univ, Dept Biophys, Med Coll, Lazarza 16, PL-31530 Krakow, Poland";"Dziob, D (corresponding author), Jagiellonian Univ, Smoluchowski Inst Phys, Lojasiewicza 11, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland.; Dziob, D (corresponding author), Jagiellonian Univ, Dept Biophys, Med Coll, Lazarza 16, PL-31530 Krakow, Poland.";daniel.dziob@uj.edu.pl;, Daniel/AAB-7625-2021;, Daniel/0000-0003-2065-600X;NA;NA;NA;76;2;2;4;7;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0157-244X;1573-1898;NA;RES SCI EDUC;Res.

The objective of this module was to create a gamified review of core obstetric and gynecology (OB-GYN) topics that residents would find educational and informative. Methods The game created was modeled after the TV show So You Think You Can Dance?, with a warm-up and several rounds of rapid-fire OB-GYN questions and cases, eliminating teams to a final face-off. The residents were given a post-session survey to determine their attitudes and learning towards this virtual conference approach. Results Based on the post-session survey, the majority of the residents found this activity to be educational, entertaining, engaging, and better than the traditional lecture format. Conclusion This initial attempt at migrating gamification, a core component of our live conferences, into the new virtual arena, was well-received by learners as effective, educational, and engaging. This style of gamification can be incorporated into residency programs at other institutions currently limited to virtual platforms to boost resident education and engagement.;"[O'Connell, Alanna; Tomaselli, Peter J.] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Emergency Med, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Stobart-Gallagher, Megan] Thomas Jefferson Univ Hosp, Emergency Med, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA";Stobart-Gallagher, M (corresponding author), Thomas Jefferson Univ Hosp, Emergency Med, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.;mstobartgallagher@gmail.com;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;8;4;4;0;0;CUREUS INC;PALO ALTO;PO BOX 61002, PALO ALTO, CA 94306 USA;NA;2168-8184;NA;CUREUS;Cureus;jun/01;2020;12;6;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;e8397;10.7759/cureus.8397;NA;NA;7;Medicine, General & Internal;General & Internal Medicine;LT4RG;WOS:000537059000013;32550087;Green Published, Other Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Gamification is a technique that has been shown to improve engagement, transferring the positive effects of videogames. However, the mobile games industry has identified that player retention decreases quickly over time, but it is unclear if this decreasing retention pattern transfers to gamification activities. To check if the behavioral engagement was stable over a 14-week engineering course, we gamified an existing virtual learning environment (VLE), conducting an observational study for two semesters. Actions performed by students within the VLE were used to measure behavioral engagement, which allows us to track student behavior weekly. To analyze the gamification effect, we divided user actions into two groups: academic and gamified. The results showed that the gamified actions performed by students in the VLE decreased every week, which was significantly higher than the decrease in academic actions. This shows that the decreasing retention pattern seen in mobile games was also present in this study. These results suggest that, just like in mobile games, to sustain the behavioral engagement over a long period of time in a gamified class, additional modern game-design techniques should be considered.;"[Corvalan, Benjamin; Recabarren, Matias; Echeverria, Alejandro] Univ los Andes, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, Santiago 7620001, Chile";Recabarren, M (corresponding author), Univ los Andes, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, Santiago 7620001, Chile.;mrecabarren@miuandes.cl;NA;NA;CONICYT - Chile (National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, Fondecyt)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11130067];The present research has been sponsored by CONICYT - Chile (National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, Fondecyt Iniciacion N degrees 11130067).;NA;41;0;0;1;17;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;NA;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

Gamification in higher education can provide to students better opportunities to develop commitment skills, increasing their motivation and making them more interested in what they are learning. The purpose of this review is to collect information, synthesize and integrate published works on the influence of gamification with the motivation and learning of students. With this, it is intended to establish the current state of knowledge on gamification in education, which will allow a better approach to future lines of research. Representative studies were identified through a systematic search in 4 databases: EBSCO SPORTDISCUS, SCOPUS, ISI and SCHOLAR GOOGLE, extracting data about the study design, participants, variables, instruments and results. We included 22 studies, 19 originals and 3 reviews of the literature. Initial evidence indicates that gamification in higher education motivates students and improves their learning, providing university students with better opportunities to develop commitment skills. The use of PBL (Points, Badges and Leaderboards) improves motivation and is considered as an adequate combination of mechanics in the implementation of any gamification process in higher education.

The goal of this work is to understand how gamification has been used to engage students in peer review activities and to summarize the empirical evidence for its effectiveness. Our main contribution is the presentation of a general model of the peer review process that captures the students' activities and an examination of the specific actions within this model that have been gamified in the current literature. We also summarize the commonly used game mechanics and the context and year level of courses in which prior research has been conducted, along with the reported effects on student behavior. We find that artifact assessment and artifact creation are the two most commonly gamified actions with respect to our peer review model and that the quantity and quality of both the artifacts and the generated feedback are the most popular reward criteria. In addition, Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) are the discipline areas in which gamified peer review activities are most often reported. In general, while the existing peer review literature reports mostly positive effects of gamification on student engagement, the range of student actions which have been incentivized remains narrow. Key activities, such as student reflection on the feedback received, have been largely unexplored with respect to gamification and thus present useful avenues for future work.;"[Indriasari, Theresia Devi; Luxton-Reilly, Andrew; Denny, Paul] Univ Auckland, Fac Sci, Sch Comp Sci, 38 Princes St, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [Indriasari, Theresia Devi] Univ Atma Jaya Yogyakarta, Dept Informat, Jalan Babarsari 43, Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia";"Indriasari, TD (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Fac Sci, Sch Comp Sci, 38 Princes St, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.; Indriasari, TD (corresponding author), Univ Atma Jaya Yogyakarta, Dept Informat, Jalan Babarsari 43, Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia.";tind115@aucklanduni.ac.nz;NA;Indriasari, Theresia Devi/0000-0002-9363-9369;Indonesian Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) as part of the Ph.D. scholarship;This work has been funded by Indonesian Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) as part of the Ph.D. scholarship.;NA;92;2;2;10;28;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1360-2357;1573-7608;NA;EDUC INF TECHNOL;Educ.

The test results indicate that students in the flipped class (n = 28) significantly outperformed those in the traditional (n = 27) and online independent study (n = 21) classes. In addition, flipped learning with gamification promoted students' cognitive engagement better than the other two approaches. The findings of student interviews suggest that peer interactions inside the flipped classroom were critical to promoting students' mathematics achievement and cognitive engagement, as opposed to online learning resources and gamification per se. In future practice, teachers can ground their flipped classroom design in the theoretical framework proposed in this study.;"[Lo, Chung Kwan; Hew, Khe Foon] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China";Lo, CK (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;cklohku@gmail.com;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;57;17;17;42;42;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1049-4820;1744-5191;NA;INTERACT LEARN ENVIR;Interact.

Background We adapted an evidence-based, flexibly delivered program for use with low-income, unmarried couples, for whom the outcome literature is scarce. Method Couples (N = 443) were recruited from maternity units and began CCP. They completed measures before, during, and immediately after the intervention and again 6 months later. Results Experience of moderate psychological intimate partner violence (IPV) declined and perceived parenting efficacy increased over time; there was no change in severe psychological or physical IPV. Individuals with lower levels of relationship commitment than their partners showed improvement in relationship satisfaction, whereas those with similar or higher levels of commitment maintained their baseline levels despite being in a period of expected satisfaction decline. Conclusion CCP showed some signs of helping low-income couples during a stressful period, and its flexible service delivery model allowed these couples to participate by reducing the impediments of transportation challenges, conflicting work schedules, and overall time poverty. Implications The results of this study suggest practitioners interested in using CCP with low-income couples would likely maximize the impact by (a) focusing on pregnant, first-time parents; (b) integrating CCP within postnatal health care; and (c) assuming that a considerable minority of couples will avail themselves of only up to two sessions, and thus practitioners should frontload content, making other content optional or just-in-time. In addition, nonpsychoeducational elements (e.g., gamification, easy computerized tasks to reduce angry responses, watching couple-themed movies) could enliven preventative offerings for perinatal couples.";"[Heyman, Richard E.; Baucom, Katherine J.

In particular, SLEs have been used to introduce, on a medium and large scale, gamification strategies as a complement to traditional learning procedures. In this context, the existence of gamified activities can probably change the type and strength of the social relationships encouraged by the SLE among students. In this case study, we examine an SLE endowed with gamification capabilities and discuss the interplay between the designed gamified tasks and the resulting network of communications among the agents. Our findings reveal that the network structure reflects the interactions within the class in a nontrivial way and conversely that the network structure can be used to anticipate or predict the evolution of the student groups throughout the course. The results of this study support the claim that when the activities are designed around well-conceived gamification and reward mechanisms, they quite easily capture the interest of the participants, whose engagement does not diminish with the progress of the academic term.;"[Sousa-Vieira, Maria E.; Lopez-Ardao, Jose C.; Fernandez-Veiga, Manuel; Ferreira-Pires, Orlando] Univ Vigo, Dept Telemat Engn, Vigo, Spain";Sousa-Vieira, ME (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Dept Telemat Engn, EE Telecomun, C Maxwell S-N, Vigo 36310, Spain.;estela@det.uvigo.es;"Ardao, Jose Carlos Lopez/L-6408-2014; Sousa Vieira, Maria Estrella/L-4960-2014";"Ardao, Jose Carlos Lopez/0000-0002-3390-0035; Sousa Vieira, Maria Estrella/0000-0002-3963-0451";NA;NA;NA;50;0;0;1;8;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;NA;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

Materials and Methods: An interactive computer module (Interactive Module to Halt Abuse of Prescriptions in Preteens and Youth [I'M HAPPY]) was created using a combination of e-learning and animation software. The module used narrated illustrations, animations, and games to explain what over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription drugs are, how they are used correctly, and what risks they carry. Animated drug refusal scenarios with user-determined outcomes were also incorporated. Sixth-grade students were asked to complete the module online and were given a 14-question pretest and posttest on the definitions, adverse effects, and proper use of OTC and prescription medicines. They were also asked to rank the perceived helpfulness of several drug refusal strategies. Student opinions about the computer module itself were collected on the posttest. Results: Students (n = 34) scored better on quiz questions following the module. They also showed increased favorability toward three of four drug refusal strategies after completing the module, with a greater proportion ranking these strategies Very Helpful. Most students indicated they learned new things from the module (79%) and found it enjoyable (88%) and easy to use (97%). Conclusion: The I'M HAPPY program improved student knowledge of OTC and prescription drugs and enhanced perceptions of the helpfulness of certain drug refusal strategies. The computer module was considered enjoyable and easy to use, and can be easily disseminated to any student or classroom having internet access.;"[Rose, Tyler M.] Roseman Univ Hlth Sci, Coll Pharm, 10920 River Front Pkwy, South Jordan, UT 84095 USA; [Unni, Elizabeth J.] Touro Coll Pharm, Dept Social Behav & Adm Sci, New York, NY USA";Rose, TM (corresponding author), Roseman Univ Hlth Sci, Coll Pharm, 10920 River Front Pkwy, South Jordan, UT 84095 USA.;trose@roseman.edu;NA;NA;Health Living Grant from the American Medical Association Foundation;This work was supported by a Health Living Grant from the American Medical Association Foundation awarded to E.J.U.;NA;29;0;0;0;4;MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC;NEW ROCHELLE;140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA;2161-783X;2161-7856;NA;GAMES HEALTH J;Games Health J.;AUG 1;2020;9;4;NA;NA;NA;NA;273;278;NA;10.1089/g4h.2019.0037;NA;MAY 2020;6;"Health Policy & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Rehabilitation";"Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Rehabilitation";NB1WQ;WOS:000532163400001;32379500;NA;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

This paper suggests a gamified flipped classroom approach to address this challenge. In an experimental study, N = 205 educational science students performed either gamified in-class activities using a gamified quiz with points and a team leaderboard, or non-gamified in-class activities using exercise sheets. In line with the theory of gamified learning, the results show a positive indirect effect of gamification on application-oriented knowledge that is mediated by learning process performance. Furthermore, based on a self-determination theory framework, the results show positive effects of gamified in-class activities on intrinsic motivation and social relatedness, but no significant effect on competence need satisfaction. The study provides insights into a particular casual construct of game design elements (points and team leaderboards) triggering specific mechanisms (immediate task-level feedback and team competition) affecting a mediator (learning process performance) that in turn affects a learning outcome (application-oriented knowledge).;"[Sailer, Michael] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Chair Educ & Educ Psychol, Munich, Germany; [Sailer, Maximilian] Univ Passau, Educ Sci, Passau, Germany";Sailer, M (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Chair Educ & Educ Psychol, Munich, Germany.;Michael.Sailer@psy.lmu.de;NA;"Sailer, Maximilian/0000-0003-2241-7694; Sailer, Michael/0000-0001-6831-5429";NA;NA;NA;46;4;4;14;28;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0007-1013;1467-8535;NA;BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL;Br.

Computer science in higher education is a tough area of study and thus needs to utilize various already explored benefits of gamification. This research develops an empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in teaching computer science in higher education. Along with the learning outcomes, the effect of group size on students' satisfaction level is also measured. Furthermore, the impact of gamification over time is analyzed throughout a semester to observe its effectiveness as a long-term learning technique.

Our gamification approach was based on the self-determination theory. According to this theory, people need to have competence, social connectedness, and autonomy in order to feel determined to perform certain activities. We aimed to investigate the effects of teaching presence in online gamification on sustainability learning and self-determination as well as identify the driving factors and barriers to sustaining students' participation in online gamified activity. A mobile application called JouleBug was used. It contains game elements and aims to encourage pro-environmental behaviours. Our quasi-experimental design included two university courses (as control and treatment groups) on sustainable education with 48 participants. Both groups worked with JouleBug, whereas the treatment group was also supported by their teacher's teaching presence. To establish online teaching presence, the teacher shares the students' leader board rankings, acknowledges the students' achievements, and give comments and feedback on students' activities in the chatting group twice a week. Sustainability knowledge and pro-environmental behaviour were measured through survey. Students' performance in the gamified activities was measured through collected points in the JouleBug application. The drivers and barriers to sustaining the students' participation in JouleBug activities were identified through focus group interviews and students' reflection writing. We found there were significant differences in the sustainability knowledge, pro-environmental behaviour, and performance between the treatment and control groups. The Cohen's d effect size value obtained for the treatment on sustainability knowledge, pro-environmental behaviour, and students' performance indicates a large effect as well. Focus group interviews with the participants and the students' reflection writings revealed that the driving factors in sustaining the participation in the gamified activities in the application are recognition by teachers and peers, competition, and sense of belonging to a group. Meanwhile, the barriers to sustaining participation in online gamification are time constraints, boredom caused by lack of social interaction, and boredom caused by activity repetition and activity's inappropriate level of difficulty. The conclusion is the teacher plays a role as an agent in this online gamification learning context. The findings suggest that teaching presence is one of the important building blocks that encourage the students' participation and learning in online gamification.;"[Mahmud, Siti Nur Diyana; Soh, Tuan Mastura Tuan] Univ Kebangsaan, Fac Educ, STEM Enculturat Res Ctr, Bangi 43600, Malaysia; [Husnin, Hazrati] Univ Kebangsaan, Fac Educ, Ctr Learning & Teaching Innovat, Bangi 43600, Malaysia";Mahmud, SND (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan, Fac Educ, STEM Enculturat Res Ctr, Bangi 43600, Malaysia.;"diyana@ukm.edu.my; hazrati@ukm.edu.my; tuanmastura@ukm.edu.my";"MAHMUD, SITI NUR DIYANA/AAQ-2327-2020; Husnin, Hazrati/AAL-9665-2021";"MAHMUD, SITI NUR DIYANA/0000-0001-6398-1166; Husnin, Hazrati/0000-0002-6165-2411; Tuan Soh, Tuan Mastura/0000-0002-8980-4544";Faculty of Education, The National University of Malaysia [GG-2019-080];This research was funded by the Faculty of Education, The National University of Malaysia (grant number GG-2019-080).;NA;39;2;2;4;15;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2071-1050;NA;SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL;Sustainability;MAY;2020;12;9;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;3801;10.3390/su12093801;NA;NA;17;"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies";"Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology";LU0TK;WOS:000537476200299;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

An algorithm for the generation of tests with different levels of complexity using multi-criteria optimization is proposed. It is important to note that all test items could be considered as an element of a level in an educational game or gamified environment, and their weight influences the complexity of the game. The results show that the proposed model allows the generation of tests not only with different levels of complexity, but it also provides additional flexibility in respect of the selected number of questions and their weight.

In order to achieve this, this article describes the organisational structure of the field research in terms of publications, authors and journals as well as identifying and classifying the research articles about adopting gamification methods. Hence, the subject of analysis encapsulates scientific articles published in either the ISI Web of Science (WOS) or Scopus (SCO) databases related to the application of gamification to the teaching process in general and to management in particular. The present research focused on the mapping of the literature related to the application of gamification to the management field because we didn't find an article in the literature addressing this particular area.

EPCs are traditionally visualized as 2D graphs and their size varies with the complexity of the process. While process modeling experts are used to interpreting complex 2D EPCs, in certain scenarios such as, for example, professional training or education, also novice users inexperienced in interpreting 2D EPC data are facing the challenge of learning and understanding complex process models. To communicate process knowledge in an effective yet motivating and interesting way, we propose a novel virtual reality (VR) interface for non-expert users. Our proposed system turns the exploration of arbitrarily complex EPCs into an interactive and multi-sensory VR experience. It automatically generates a virtual 3D environment from a process model and lets users explore processes through a combination of natural walking and teleportation. Our immersive interface leverages basic gamification in the form of a logical walkthrough mode to motivate users to interact with the virtual process. The generated user experience is entirely novel in the field of immersive data exploration and supported by a combination of visual, auditory, vibrotactile and passive haptic feedback. In a user study with $\mathrm{N}=27$ novice users, we evaluate the effect of our proposed system on process model understandability and user experience, while comparing it to a traditional 2D interface on a tablet device. The results indicate a tradeoff between efficiency and user interest as assessed by the UEQ novelty subscale, while no significant decrease in model understanding performance was found using the proposed VR interface. Our investigation highlights the potential of multi-sensory VR for less time-critical professional application domains, such as employee training, communication, education, and related scenarios focusing on user interest.;"[Zenner, Andre; Makhsadov, Akhmajon; Klingner, Soren; Liebemann, David; Kruger, Antonio] German Res Ctr Artificial Intelligence DFKI, Saarland Informat Campus, Saarbrucken, Germany";Zenner, A (corresponding author), German Res Ctr Artificial Intelligence DFKI, Saarland Informat Campus, Saarbrucken, Germany.;"andre.zenner@dfki.de; akhmajon.makhsadov@dfki.de; soren.klingner@dfki.de; david.liebemann@dfki.de; antonio.kruger@dfki.de";NA;Zenner, Andre/0000-0003-3386-1635;German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01IS17043];We thank Scheer Holding for supporting this project and all participants of the study for their time and feedback.

In this context, our work evaluates the use of mobile augmented reality without markers as the technology to implement a multiplayer game scenario that can be used to improve socialization, communication skills and emotional intelligence in primary school children. The present study addresses the usability of two gameplay styles and their impact on users' communication and motivation: competitive vs collaborative play. The game integrates Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) technology without markers to create a geolocation scenario with unlimited physical space. The results indicate that both game modes are intrinsically satisfactory for children triggering positive emotions such as enthusiasm, enjoyment and curiosity that improve the participants' mood and help increase the degree of involvement. Moreover, we observed that the collaborative game version has a greater impact on emotional affection, social interaction and interest. In addition, we observed in our study that the quality of the communication in the collaborative mode is good in terms of several factors such as sustaining mutual understanding, dialogue management, information pooling, reaching consensus, time management and reciprocal interaction. Finally, several design implications and suggestions related to game time management, scaffolding, mixed competitive-collaborative modes, dynamic 3D content and active learning, among others, are discussed.

It provides the detailed examination of the true experimental design of a co-creative gamified classroom that could be used in different academic subjects in social science education. In this pedagogical experiment, we tested the effects of a co-creative gamification classroom within a Public Sector Economics course attended by 253 first-year master's students. We used pre-test and post-test examinations, surveys, and interviews to evaluate and compare effects on learning outcomes and course evaluations of different classroom modes (with and without a co-creative approach and digital simulation games). This paper presents a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the proposed experimental design, using treatment and control groups. Our conclusions make a contribution to the discussion of the co-creative approach in education, proving that its digital implementation can develop students' generic and professional skills.

It is among the most popular game-based learning platforms, with 70 million monthly active unique users and used by 50% of US K-12 students. Since the platform was released in 2013, many studies have been published on the effect of using Kahoot! in the classroom, but so far, no systematic analysis of the results. This article presents the results of a literature review on the effect of using Kahoot! for learning and, more specifically, on how Kahoot! affects learning performance, classroom dynamics, students' and teachers' attitudes and perceptions, and students' anxiety. The literature review includes 93 studies, and the main conclusion is that Kahoot! can have a positive effect on learning performance, classroom dynamics, students' and teachers' attitudes, and students' anxiety. However, there are also studies where Kahoot! has little or no effect. The main challenges mentioned by students include technical problems such as unreliable internet connections, hard to read questions and answers on a projected screen, not being able to change answer after submission, stressful time-pressure for giving answers, not enough time to answer, afraid of losing, and hard to catch up if an incorrect answer had been given. Further, the main challenges mentioned by teachers include getting the difficulty level of questions and answers right, problems related to network connectivity, scoring based on how quickly the students answer reducing student reflection and cause some students to guess without thinking, that some students can have a problem with failing a quiz, and some teachers find it challenging to use the technology.;"[Wang, Alf Inge; Tahir, Rabail] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Comp Sci, Sem Saelandsvei 9, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway";Wang, AI (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Comp Sci, Sem Saelandsvei 9, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.;"alfw@idi.ntnu.no; rabail.tahir@ntnu.no";NA;NA;"Fulbright; Department of Computer Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)";Thanks to Institute for Software Research (ISR) at University of California, Irvine for hosting a research visitor and providing a stimulating research environment, Fulbright for the research scholar program for financial support, and Department of Computer Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) for moral and financial support for a research visit in California where the work on this article took place.;NA;146;23;24;11;48;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;NA;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

For uncommon events in medicine, such as pediatric CPR, more frequent training is associated with improved performance among healthcare providers and physicians in training. Gamified learning may facilitate motivation to practice CPR, though studies to support this are lacking. Intervention. Residents were interviewed to understand motivating factors for CPR practice outside of a traditional classroom certification setting. Methods. We used a qualitative study design within a larger multinational study. Semi-structured, one-on-one interviews were completed with pediatric residents using a constructivist approach. Transcripts were reviewed independently by two authors (IHG, JLS). Results. The inductive framework gradually moved away from gamification and towards that of self-determination. Participating residents reported several types of intrinsic and extrinsic motivational drivers towards practicing CPR, such as practicing CPR to prepare, or as a connection to clinical practice. Some themes were amotivational, such as performance anxiety, and detracted from their drive to practice. Despite a gamification design to this curriculum, these components were rarely mentioned. These themes related to achieving Maslow's three psychological needs of autonomy, relatedness and competence. Conclusion. The motivation to practice CPR among residents aligns with the self-determination theory. By stimulating intrinsic motivating factors, future curriculum design may better motivate residents to practice CPR.;"[Harwayne-Gidansky, Ilana] Stony Brook Childrens Hosp, 100 Nicolls Rd,HSC T11-047, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Balmer, Dorene F.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Doughty, Cara B.] Texas Childrens Hosp, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Scarlatos, Lori L.] SUNY Stony Brook, Coll Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Technol & Soc, Dept Comp Sci,Comp Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Scarlatos, Lori L.] SUNY Stony Brook, Coll Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Technol & Soc, Dept Comp Sci,cDACT, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Chang, Todd] Univ Southern Calif, Childrens Hosp Los Angeles, Div Emergency & Transport Med, Keck Sch Med,Dept Pediat & Med Educ, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Chang, Todd; Song, Joo Lee] Univ Southern Calif, Childrens Hosp Los Angeles, Div Emergency & Transport Med, Keck Sch Med,Dept Pediat, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA";Harwayne-Gidansky, I (corresponding author), Stony Brook Childrens Hosp, 100 Nicolls Rd,HSC T11-047, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.;"ilanahg@gmail.com; BALMERD@EMAIL.CHOP.EDU; cbdought@texaschildrens.org; lori.scarlatos@stonybrook.edu; dr.toddchang@gmail.com; josong@chla.usc.edu";Harwayne-Gidansky, Ilana/I-9528-2019;"Harwayne-Gidansky, Ilana/0000-0001-7987-6440; Chang, Todd/0000-0002-4508-2551; Scarlatos, Lori/0000-0002-6635-1773";American Heart Association Western StatesAmerican Heart Association [15GRNT25030000];The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was made possible by the American Heart Association Western States Grant-in-Aid (15GRNT25030000) (TPC).;NA;37;2;2;3;3;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;1046-8781;1552-826X;NA;SIMULAT GAMING;Simul.

Design/methodology/approach This study conducts a systematic literature review and explores available gamified applications for disaster emergency planning and their purpose of use. In total, 51 scholarly articles on the topic and 35 disaster-related gamified applications are reviewed. Findings The findings reveal the following: (a) gamified applications (n = 35) are used for education, research and intervention purposes; (b) gamified applications create new opportunities for community engagement and raise disaster awareness among the community in virtual environments; and (c) gamified applications help shape a new culture - i.e. gamified culture - that supports smart disaster emergency planning practice. Originality/value During the recent years, utilisation of game elements in non-game contexts - i.e., gamification - has become a popular approach in motivating people in various actions. Increasing research highlighted the benefits of gamification in enhancing community engagement, creating interactive environments, providing better behavioural outcomes and influencing democratic processes. Despite some of the applications indicating the potential of gamification in disaster emergency planning, the use of gamification technique in this discipline is an understudied area.

However, research to date has predominately examined such games in established democratic contexts and has primarily focused on the potential of in-game content and game mechanics for achieving learning and behavior change outcomes. This study used in-depth interviews with key developmental stakeholders for two civic-focused games, Haki2 in Kenya and Your Excellency in Nigeria, to further our understanding in two important but understudied areas: the potential for games to facilitate civic learning and engagement outcomes in developing democratic contexts; and the role of game production and dissemination processes in this potential. I argue that these processes provide opportunities for direct civic engagement, participatory learning, and group mobilization relevant to facilitating civic behavior in developing democratic contexts. While this research identifies critical limitations for games used as stand-alone tools to achieve civic learning and engagement outcomes, it also identifies the potential for game production and dissemination to engage communities in democratic deliberation, in identifying relevant civic-issues and solutions, to facilitate community discussion, and to mobilize players around relevant issues.";[Fisher, Jolene] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA;Fisher, J (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Coll Media Commun & Informat, 1511 Univ Ave, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Jolene.Fisher@Colorado.edu;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;40;0;0;2;8;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;0163-4437;1460-3675;NA;MEDIA CULT SOC;Media Cult.

When viewed through the lens of systems thinking, the use of these ubiquitous tools can be a driving force for the development of a sustainable world because of their global use and reach. The authors concentrate on flat e-learning platforms, social media tools, virtual reality platforms, and machinima, as these tools enable learners to participate in different interdisciplinary topics and exercise habits that trigger behavioral changes through learning by doing or learning from mistakes. To demonstrate the potential of innovative didactic tools, examples of mini scenarios for the development of chemistry lessons are provided, and these scenarios promote the sustainability concept and systems thinking. The authors conclude that the pursuit of sustainability goals in chemistry education should involve extended thinking about instructional design and asymmetries in technology use, as well as incorporate green teaching into the principles of green chemistry.;"[Gawlik-Kobylinska, Malgorzata; Maciejewski, Pawel] War Studies Univ, PL-00910 Warsaw, Poland; [Walkowiak, Wladyslaw] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland";Gawlik-Kobylinska, M (corresponding author), War Studies Univ, PL-00910 Warsaw, Poland.;ggawlik2000@yahoo.com;"Gawlik-Kobylinska, Malgorzata/F-2787-2015; Maciejewski, Pawel/D-8817-2019";"Gawlik-Kobylinska, Malgorzata/0000-0003-3851-6355; Maciejewski, Pawel/0000-0001-9934-2956";Ministry of National Defense (Poland), MON Research Grant [GB/4/2018/208/2018/DA];Funding for the present work was supported by the Ministry of National Defense (Poland), MON Research Grant GB/4/2018/208/2018/DA (2018-2020).;NA;79;3;3;8;35;AMER CHEMICAL SOC;WASHINGTON;1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0021-9584;1938-1328;NA;J CHEM EDUC;J.

Didactic research should evaluate the effectiveness of educational methods to know if they are applicable, useful, and in what sense. Exergames are digital motor games that aim to stimulate players' motor skills. Gamification refers to the use of game-based elements in nongame contexts to motivate actions. This research evaluates a gamified exergaming intervention, designed to improve children's academic performance by focusing on understanding applicability and usefulness. A natural experiment was set up in schools according to a mixed methods design. The qualitative data herein reported were collected during a natural experiment with a nonrandomized controlled design. The qualitative research design was used with field notes, an open-questions questionnaire, individual semi-structured interviews and focus group interviews. Eight teachers and 417 students took part. A content analysis was chosen as the methodological orientation. The facilitators were the realism of their didactic design and their adaptability to different educational contexts. The main barriers were the required materials and facilities. Teachers and students' attitudes were very positive, although future use was inconclusive. These findings may imply that this study is one of the few to provide positive evidence for educational gamification. The Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics gamification model and the Just Dance Now exergame may be applicable and useful for didactics in Physical Education, but all the participants' suggestions need to be considered to improve teaching interventions.;"[Quintas-Hijos, Alejandro] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Educ Sci, Huesca, Spain; [Penarrubia-Lozano, Carlos] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Mus Plast & Corporal Express, Zaragoza, Spain; [Carlos Bustamante, Juan] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Psychol & Sociol, Zaragoza, Spain";Bustamante, JC (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Dept Psychol & Sociol, Zaragoza, Spain.;jbustama@unizar.es;Penarrubia-Lozano, Carlos/L-7068-2018;Penarrubia-Lozano, Carlos/0000-0002-3776-2901;"Fundacion Hergar [2018/0081]; Fundacion Bancaria Ibercaja [JIUZ-2017SOC-06]; FEDER (Programa Operativo 2014-2020); Regional Aragon Government [INFR2016_UZ_SOC_05]; Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport";This research has been supported by Grants received by JCB from the Fundacion Hergar (2018/0081) (https://www.fundacionhergar.org/), from the Fundacion Bancaria Ibercaja (JIUZ-2017SOC-06) (https://www.fundacionibercaja.es/), and from FEDER (Programa Operativo 2014-2020) and the Regional Aragon Government (INFR2016_UZ_SOC_05) (https://www.aragon.es/-/feder-fondos-fondos-europeos-gobierno-dearagon).Finally, the first author (AQH) wishes to thank the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport (http://www.mecd.gob.es/) for the funding used to obtain a predoctoral university contract to conduct this study.

It is uncertain as to whether students require skills and challenges to engage them in the game for enhancing their learning. Thus, the objective of this article is to examine the mediating role of engagement in the relationship between skill and perceived learning as well as between challenge and perceived learning in game-based learning environments. Data was gathered using a survey of Player Unknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) players. A total of 233 young Indian players participated in the study. The results showed that engagement fully mediates the relationship between skill and perceived learning as well as between challenge and perceived learning. This study contributes to the literature on game-based learning by providing evidence for the educational video games to be one of the effective means of learning.

Serious games are effective and innovative digital tools for educating patients about positive health behaviors. There are limited systematic reviews that examine the prevalence of serious games that incorporate medication use. Objective: This systematic review aimed to identify (1) serious games intended to educate patients about medication adherence, education, and safety; (2) types of theoretical frameworks used to develop serious games for medication use; and (3) sampling frames for evaluating serious games on medication use. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for literature about medication-based serious games for patients. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed for article selection. Results: Using PRISMA guidelines, 953 publications and 749 unique titles were identified from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. A total of 16 studies featuring 12 unique serious games were included with components of medication adherence, education, and safety, published from 2003 to 2019. Of the 12 games included, eight serious games were tested in adolescents, three games were tested in young adults, and one game was tested in adults. Most studies (n=11) used small sample sizes to test the usability of serious games. Theoretical frameworks identified in the 12 serious games included information, motivation, and behavior theory; social cognitive theory; precede-proceed model; middle-range theory of chronic illness; adult learning theory; experiential learning theory; and the theory of reasoned action. Existing reviews explore serious games focused on the management of specific disease states, such as HIV, diabetes, and asthma, and on the positive impact of serious game education in each respective disease state. Although other reviews target broad topics such as health care gamification and serious games to educate health care workers, no reviews focus solely on medication use. Serious games were mainly focused on improving adherence, whereas medication safety was not widely explored. Little is known about the efficacy and usability of medication-focused serious games often because of small and nonrepresentative sample sizes, which limit the generalizability of existing studies. Conclusions: Limited studies exist on serious games for health that incorporate medication use. The findings from these studies focus on developing and testing serious games that teach patients about medication use and safety. Many of these studies do not apply a theoretical framework in the design and assessment of these games. In the future, serious game effectiveness could be improved by increasing study sample size and diversity of study participants, so that the results are generalizable to broader populations. Serious games should describe the extent of theoretical framework incorporated into game design and evaluate success by testing the player's retention of learning objectives.";"[Abraham, Olufunmilola; Lemay, Sarah; Bittner, Sarah; Thakur, Tanvee; Stafford, Haley] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Pharm, Social & Adm Sci Div, 777 Highland Ave,2515 Rennebohm Hall, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Brown, Randall] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Family Med & Community Hlth, Madison, WI USA";Abraham, O (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Pharm, Social & Adm Sci Div, 777 Highland Ave,2515 Rennebohm Hall, Madison, WI 53705 USA.;olufunmilola.abraham@wisc.edu;NA;"Brown, Randall/0000-0002-5445-8119; Stafford, Haley/0000-0002-8343-9718; LeMay, Sarah/0000-0001-7592-9007";Clinical and Translational Science Award program, through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences [KL2 TR002374-03, UL1TR002373];The authors would like to thank Lisa Szela at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) School of Pharmacy for assisting with editing the manuscript.

The interface is designed to appeal to Pacific people, a population group with a higher risk of developing clinically significant behavioral problems than most other ethnic groups in New Zealand. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the opinions of parents and professionals about the acceptability, usability, and content of Play Kindly. Methods: We used qualitative and Pacific and Maori research methodologies. A total of five focus groups with 45 parents and 12 individual interviews with professionals were conducted. The five focus groups consisted of 2 pan-Pacific groups, 1 Maori group, 1 open group, and 1 group of young Pacific adults or prospective parents. The professionals were from a range of disciplines, and the majority had expertise in early childhood, parenting interventions, or research in this field. Results: Play Kindly appealed to both parents and professionals. Participants related to the scenarios, which were created in collaboration with a playwright and animator. Although most participants liked the Pacific feel, there was some disagreement about how culturally specific the app should be. A range of issues with usability and gamification techniques were highlighted, likely attributed to the low budget and lack of initial co-design with parents as well as professionals with specific expertise in parenting. A number of parents and professionals felt that the parenting strategies were overly simplified and did not take into account the context in which the behavior occurred. Professionals suggested narrowing the focus of the app to deliver two important parenting messages: playing with your child and positively reinforcing desired behaviors. Conclusions: Play Kindly is the first culturally adapted parenting app of its kind designed for Pacific parents and other New Zealanders with children 2-5 years of age. This app has potential in Pacific communities where there are limited culturally specific parenting resources. The results of this study will guide improvements of the app prior to testing it in an open trial.;"[Mairs, Rebecca A.; Bekker, Marthinus J.; Patolo, Tony; Hopkins, Sarah A.; Cowley-Malcolm, Esther T.; Merry, Sally N.] Univ Auckland, Dept Psychol Med, Auckland, New Zealand; [Perese, Lana M.] Malatest Int, Auckland, New Zealand; [Sundborn, Gerhard B.] Univ Auckland, Dept Pacific Hlth, Auckland, New Zealand";Bekker, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Psychol Med, Auckland Mail Ctr, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.;marthinus.bekker@auckland.ac.nz;"; Bekker, Marthinus/O-7232-2018";"Patolo, Tony/0000-0002-8544-0798; Merry, Sally/0000-0002-8281-1573; Bekker, Marthinus/0000-0002-4134-2811; Hopkins, Sarah/0000-0002-4705-5362";"Quaker Peace and Service-Aotearoa New Zealand; Cure Kids foundation";The creation of Play Kindly was made possible in the first instance by funding from Quaker Peace and Service-Aotearoa New Zealand, the Loxley award with funding for further development, and the research reported here provided by the Cure Kids foundation.

Adequate use of this equipment is more critical than ever because the risk of shortages must be balanced against the need to effectively protect health care workers, including prehospital personnel. Specific training is therefore necessary; however, the need for social distancing has markedly disrupted the delivery of continuing education courses. Electronic learning (e-learning) may provide significant advantages because it requires neither the physical presence of learners nor the repetitive use of equipment for demonstration. Objective: Inclusion of game mechanics, or gamification, has been shown to increase knowledge and skill acquisition. The objective of this research was to develop a gamified e-learning module to interactively deliver concepts and information regarding the correct choice and handling of PPE. Methods: The SERES framework was used to define and describe the development process, including scientific and design foundations. After we defined the target audience and learning objectives by interviewing the stakeholders, we searched the scientific literature to establish relevant theoretical bases. The learning contents were validated by infection control and prehospital experts. Learning mechanics were then determined according to the learning objectives, and the content that could benefit from the inclusion of game mechanics was identified. Results: The literature search resulted in the selection and inclusion of 12 articles. In addition to gamification, pretesting, feedback, avoiding content skipping, and demonstrations using embedded videos were used as learning mechanics. Gamification was used to enhance the interactivity of the PPE donning and doffing sequences, which presented the greatest learning challenges. The module was developed with Articulate Storyline 3 to ensure that it would be compatible with a wide array of devices, as this software generates HTML5-compatible output that can be accessed on smartphones, tablets, and regular computers as long as a recent browser is available. Conclusions: A gamified e-learning module designed to promote better knowledge and understanding of PPE use among prehospital health care workers was created by following the SERES framework.

The University, as a Communicator, an intermediary between the student and the information provided to it, is forced to change the centuries-old traditions in order to stay on the market, in the face of fierce competition of the appeared open distance courses. The purpose of the research is to analyze the role of digital communication in the educational request of students. Research methods: As research methods, the following one was used: online questionnaire survey that allows you to analyze the prerequisites for the development of digital communication in the educational process and identify new opportunities in education through the personal account of the student. Research results: the article examines the reasons for using the personal account and determines the prospects for its further development in the University environment. The satisfaction of using a personal account from mobile devices among active users-students was studied. The existing problems are identified and the reasons for the rare use of the personal account are identified, strategies for attracting students' attention to the personal account are formulated. The novelty and originality of the research lies in the fact that the concept of digital communication is considered in the context of education and its functions are highlighted. The main features of digital communication are presented. The level of approval of existing and potential innovations by active student users (chat for communication, modified portfolio, task scheduler and Bulletin Board from the Institute) is determined. The opinion of students regarding the content of the main page of the personal account is revealed. The preconditions for the development of digital communication in the educational process are investigated: the emergence of digital natives' generation; the resulting request to continuing education; growing importance of self-education; formation of the concept of anticipatory learning; rapid development of open education; a trend to introduce elements of gamification into educational process; the universal gadgetization. The essence of the information and educational environment of the University and the opportunities it provides are studied. The possibilities of the student personal account as a single information space are considered. Recommendations for the modernization of the personal account are given: to rename the group of incomprehensible and non-visited subsections by students; to change the content of the main page by moving the schedule and the number of the school week on it. The research identifies problems with color (the ideal option that would solve a large number of problems, according to students, is the ability to independently design the color scheme or a choice of several options) and the design of the personal account (the main emphasis in the development of the personal account is most effective to make the development of a convenient and visual system of informing students; self-filling the main menu of the personal account, students themselves formulate the need for personalization of the personal account).";"[Belonovskaya, Izabella D.] Orenburg State Univ, Dept Technol Mech Engn Metalworking Machines & Co, Orenburg, Russia; [Matvievskaya, Elena G.] Orenburg State Pedag Univ, Dept Presch Correct Addit Educ & Problems Educ, Orenburg, Russia; [Saitbaeva, Elvira R.] Orenburg State Pedag Univ, Dept Educ Management, Orenburg, Russia; [Ksenofontova, Alla N.] Orenburg State Pedag Univ, Dept Pedag Higher Educ, Orenburg, Russia; [Usmanov, Salavat M.] Bashkir State Univ, Dept Higher Math & Phys, Birsk Branch, Birsk, Russia; [Zatsepina, Mariya B.] Moscow Pedag State Univ, Dept Aesthet Educ Presch Children, Moscow, Russia; [Bakshaeva, Elena, V] I Yakovlev Chuvash State Pedag Univ, Dept Theory Hist Methods Mus & Choral Conducting, Cheboksary, Russia";Belonovskaya, ID (corresponding author), Orenburg State Univ, Dept Technol Mech Engn Metalworking Machines & Co, Orenburg, Russia.;t251589@mail.ru;Bakshaeva, Elena/AAY-1503-2020;Bakshaeva, Elena/0000-0002-4703-0640;NA;NA;NA;32;0;0;2;2;MERT BASTAS PUBLISHING CO;CYPRUS;GOCMENKOY, NICOSIA, CYPRUS, 99010, TURKEY;1986-3497;NA;NA;ONLINE J COMMUN MEDI;Online J.

This was carried out via the implementation of several teaching units during the period of teaching practice of trainee teachers specialising in geography and history. The design of the teaching units was based on historical thinking competencies and on the introduction of active learning strategies. The programme was evaluated via a quasi-experimental A-B type methodological approach employing a pretest and a post-test. Both tools were designed on the basis of four dimensions (methodology, motivation, satisfaction and perception). The content of the tools was validated using the interjudge process via a discussion group in the first round and with a Likert scale questionnaire (1-4) with seven experts in the second round. The reliability of the tools has been estimated via three indices (Cronbach's alpha, composite reliability and omega), and the validity of the construct via an exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with the structural equation model. The results regarding reliability and validity have been adequate.

Many people feel concerned about efforts not happening quickly enough to reduce the negative impact on the climate. The responsibility for reversing this trend rests primarily on adults, but hope is now directed more and more toward the younger generation. The present project, which is a collaboration between design and education, lays the foundation for an educational endeavor based on an idea of environmental citizenship. By creating environmental citizen tokens for children and youths, this project aims to change learned living patterns and encourage a new generation to work toward a sustainable climate. There is also good possibility that the young people's involvement and striving for a better environment will transfer to adults. This has become clear in the global movement started by the environmental activist, Greta Thunberg. This article describes the work of designing and preparing the implementation of a learning project, with its basis in knowledge about environmental impact and personal responsibility. The methods underlying the project are gamification and digital activities, allied with a proven system for making a progression of skills visible. The project has resulted in a finished design and an implementation plan, which have been validated through interviews with teacher educators, principals, teachers, student-teachers, parents and pupils, and which after this validation will be tested at ten specially selected Swedish compulsory schools.;"[Thor, Daniel] Beckmans Sch Design, Dept Visual Commun, S-11437 Stockholm, Sweden; [Karlsudd, Peter] Linneuniversitetet, Dept Pedag & Learning, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden";Karlsudd, P (corresponding author), Linneuniversitetet, Dept Pedag & Learning, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden.;"daniel.thor@edu.beckmans.se; peter.karlsudd@lnu.se";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;45;0;0;4;12;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2071-1050;NA;SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL;Sustainability;APR;2020;12;8;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;3209;10.3390/su12083209;NA;NA;17;"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies";"Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology";LR3MY;WOS:000535598700142;NA;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Besides their many advantages, smartphones might pave the way to compulsive usage and addictive experiences. To remedy this problem, this study proposes an authentic approach which integrates consumer behavior theories and techniques such as unhook and gamification. An education program has been designed based on these approaches to decrease the problematic smartphone use. Method: The participants of the education program consisted of 305 students (48.2% girls and 51.8% boys) with a mean age of 14.57 (SD = 0.74). The Demographic Form and Smartphone Addiction Scale for Adolescents (SASA) were conducted before the education program and three weeks after the education. Results: The results of the paired sample t-test analysis before and after the education program revealed that the SASA total scores decreased significantly (p < 0.01). There are significant differences in terms of gender, mothers' education and class levels. Conclusion: This research emphasizes the role of an interdisciplinary approach to the addiction problem. The content used in the education program includes strategies that originally aimed at increasing consumption. The effectiveness of the program can be enhanced further in the future along with self-regulatory additions.;"[Ertemel, Adnan Veysel] Istanbul Commerce Univ, Int Trade Dept, Fac Business Adm, Istanbul 34445, Turkey; [Ari, Ela] Istanbul Medipol Univ, Psychol Dept, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Istanbul 34810, Turkey";Ertemel, AV (corresponding author), Istanbul Commerce Univ, Int Trade Dept, Fac Business Adm, Istanbul 34445, Turkey.;"avertemel@ticaret.edu.tr; eari@medipol.edu.tr";Ertemel, Adnan Veysel/AAE-1682-2019;Ertemel, Adnan Veysel/0000-0002-5028-1096;Istanbul Commerce UniversityIstanbul Ticaret University;This project was funded by Istanbul Commerce University.;NA;82;5;5;5;9;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;1660-4601;NA;INT J ENV RES PUB HE;Int.

We describe here AntibioGame (R), a serious game for improving the training of medical students in antibiotic use in primary care. Objective: We aimed to design a serious game for antibiotics teaching and to evaluate its usability and playability by medical students. Methods: We used various gamification techniques (e.g. use of mascots, avatars, rewards, leader board) and cartoon graphics in the design of AntibioGame (R). This game implements clinical case templates built from a list of learning goals defined by a medical team through an analysis of clinical practice guidelines. The game was evaluated by asking medical students to rate their satisfaction and the usability and playability of the game on an electronic form and through group discussions. The electronic form was derived from the MEEGA + scale, a fivepoint Likert scale including 32 items for assessing both usability and playability. Results: AntibioGame (R) is a case-based game in which students play the role of a doctor meeting patients in consultation and helping other health professionals to solve their problems, as in real life. The scenarios are realistic and cover situations frequently encountered in primary care. The 57 medical students enrolled found the game attractive, usable, fun, and appropriate for learning. Game quality was considered good (score = 60 on the MEEGA + scale). All the students said they would recommend the game, 96 % liked it and 81 % would use it for revision. Conclusion: AntibioGame (R) is a promising tool for improving knowledge in antibiotic prescription that could easily be included in multifaceted programs for training medical students.;"[Tsopra, Rosy] Univ Sorbonne Paris Cite, Univ Paris Descartes, Ctr Rech Cordeliers, INSERM,UMRS 1138, Paris, France; [Tsopra, Rosy] Hop Europeen Georges Pompidou, AP HP, Dept Med Informat, Paris, France; [Tsopra, Rosy] Univ Rennes 1, INSERM, LTSI Team Hlth Big Data, UMR 1099, Rennes, France; [Tsopra, Rosy; Eap, David; Cabal, Manon] Univ Paris 13, SMBH, Bobigny, France; [Courtine, Melanie; Sedki, Karima; Lamy, Jean-Baptiste] Sorbonne Univ, INSERM, LIMICS, Univ Paris 13, F-93017 Bobigny, France; [Cohen, Samuel] Sorbonne Univ, Paris, France; [Bouchaud, Olivier; Mechai, Frederic] Hop Avicenne, AP HP, Serv Malad Infect, F-93000 Bobigny, France; [Mechai, Frederic] IAME, UMR 1137, Paris, France";Tsopra, R (corresponding author), Univ Sorbonne Paris Cite, Univ Paris Descartes, Ctr Rech Cordeliers, INSERM,UMRS 1138, Paris, France.;rosy.tsopra@nhs.net;NA;Lamy, Jean-Baptiste/0000-0002-5477-180X;"Agence Nationale de Securite du Medicament et des Produits de sante (ANSM)French National Research Agency (ANR); APP 2016 - RaMiPA Project (Raisonner pour Mieux Prescrire les Antibiotiques or Reasoning for better antibiotic prescription)";Funding was obtained from the Agence Nationale de Securite du Medicament et des Produits de sante (ANSM).

Even though many studies have been conducted to investigate the efficacy of the integration of gamification to different education curriculums, few studies have examined the reactions, behaviors, and attitudes of learners toward the use of gamification in medical education. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the medical students' learning experience and acceptance of the use of gamification for the delivery of electrocardiogram lessons. Materials and Methods: A qualitative research method was used to generate findings in this study. The data collection methods included focus group discussions and interviews. Triangulation methods were used to ensure the validity and reliability of the qualitative data analyzed in this study. The thematic analysis of the data collected in this study helped to garner insights into the perception of participants and experts about the use of GaMed@(TM) for the delivery of ECG lessons. Results: A total number of 32 medical students and four experts in the fields of user experience, communication, social psychology, and game design participated in this study. The findings showed that in spite of the negative reports about the user experience and application of GaMed@(TM), the participants and experts affirmed its positive impact on the increased motivation and engagement of users. Conclusions: The impact of this concept can be maximized by tailoring the game design to foster-positive learning attributes, behaviors, and outcomes in students. However, further research studies must be conducted to investigate the impact of gamification designs on specific learning outcomes in students.;"[Ohn, May Honey] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Dept Med, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia; [Ohn, Khin-Maung] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Dept Surg, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia";Ohn, MH (corresponding author), Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Med, Jalan UMS, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Sabah, Malaysia.;mayhoney.ohn@ums.edu.my;ohn, may honey/H-3975-2018;ohn, may honey/0000-0002-1951-6598;NA;NA;NA;24;2;2;0;5;WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS;MUMBAI;WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, 400059, INDIA;1016-3190;2223-8956;NA;TZU CHI MED J;Tzu Chi Med.

Adaptive e-learning uses AI to support individual learners by responding to their different learning needs which can be determined by analyzing their navigation history of e-learning systems using data mining methods. Educational data mining (EDM) discovers new patterns of learning and teaching to facilitate the process of decision-making to serve education improvement. Gamification is another way of increasing students' engagement by using game elements in a nongame context. In this paper, the gamification technique and EDM methods were used in combination with adaptive learning to increase the students' engagement and learning performance. An adaptive gamified learning system (AGLS) was developed which combines gamification, classification, and adaptation techniques to increase the effectiveness of e-learning. This paper studies the impact of gamification and adaptive gamification on the effectiveness of e-learning through increasing students' engagement and learning performance. AGLS was applied to the data structure course. Results showed that adaptive gamification has a positive effect on students' engagement and learning performance compared to just gamification.;"[Daghestani, Lamya F.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Ibrahim, Lamiaa F.] Cairo Univ, Fac Grad Studies Stat Res, Dept Comp Sci, 5 Ahmed Zewail St, Giza 12613, Egypt; [Ibrahim, Lamiaa F.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Informat Technol Dept, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Al-Towirgi, Reem S.] Taif Univ, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Sci, At Taif, Saudi Arabia; [Salman, Hesham A.] Alshrouk Acad, Higher Inst Comp & Informat Technol, Dept Management Informat Syst, Cairo, Egypt; [Salman, Hesham A.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Informat Syst Dept, King, WI, Saudi Arabia";Ibrahim, LF (corresponding author), Cairo Univ, Fac Grad Studies Stat Res, Dept Comp Sci, 5 Ahmed Zewail St, Giza 12613, Egypt.;lfattouh@cu.edu.eg;Ibrahim, Lamiaa Fattouh/J-7904-2012;Ibrahim, Lamiaa Fattouh/0000-0001-5671-8941;NA;NA;NA;67;2;2;6;43;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;NA;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

One of these approaches is known as game-based learning (GBL). In social work education, GBL has only been seen in the last decade, and thus is relatively new. The aim of this study is to explore the use of GBL through mobile phone apps, and to examine its effectiveness in enhancing learning for social work students. This study was carried out using a quantitative research design and followed the model of a quasi-experimental study. A purposeful sample was used, namely 48 social work students registered in two sections of a course in Generalist Practice in Social Work. The experimental and control groups were compared both before and after the intervention, with the assessment based on the students' marks in the exams and on their scores for the scale that measured their perception of the effectiveness of the methodology. Although there was a strong similarity between the experimental and control groups before the GBL intervention, there was a significant difference between them after it, which indicates that digital GBL might have the potential to enhance learning in social work students.;"[Elsherbiny, Mohamed Mohamed K.; Al Maamari, Raya Hamed H.] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Art & Social Sci, Dept Sociol & Social Work, Muscat, Oman; [Elsherbiny, Mohamed Mohamed K.] Assiut Univ, Fac Social Work, Assiut, Egypt; [Al Maamari, Raya Hamed H.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Sociol & Social Policy, Nottingham, England";"Elsherbiny, MMK (corresponding author), Assiut Univ, Fac Social Work, Assiut, Egypt.; Elsherbiny, MMK (corresponding author), Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Sociol & Social Work, Muscat, Oman.";mmsherbiny@aun.edu.eg;NA;Elsherbiny, Mohamed/0000-0002-0475-6409;NA;NA;NA;28;1;1;2;11;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0261-5479;1470-1227;NA;SOC WORK EDUC;Soc.

To our knowledge, empirical research on its effectiveness in education is scarse, and almost absent in physical education. Purpose: The goal was to explore how Gamification can be used in physical education, and what experiential effects may have on students and teachers. Participants and settings: Two hundred and ninety students (age range 6-14 years) enrolled in four schools located in four regions of Spain agreed to participate. The study involved five different grades (from year two of primary school to year two of secondary school), and 12 different classes. Four physical education teachers, one from each school, also agreed to participate. All participating classes experienced the same intervention programme: MarvEF [MarvPE], based on the Marvel universe of super heroes. The project lasted 15 weeks, the whole fall semester, for a total of 30 physical education sessions (2 per week/50 min each). Gamification was the basic methodological approach used to design the three consecutive learning units experienced by all the participating students. Research design: The study followed a pre-experimental, one group pre-test-post-test design, where the same dependent variable (intrinsic motivation) is measured in only one group of participants prior and after the intervention. Data collection: A mixed methods approach was followed. It included quantitative information obtained from a questionnaire for the older students (n = 161), and qualitative information extracted from the younger students' drawings (n = 126), discussion groups with the participating teachers (n = 5), and teachers' diary (n = 2). Data analysis: Quantitative data was analysed using the statistical package SPSS (version 22.0). Qualitative data was assessed through content analysis and constant comparison. Findings: Quantitative results showed a significant increase in the students' intrinsic motivation after experiencing Gamification. Students' responses reflected one major theme: enjoyment, and two minor themes: friends and learning. On the other hand, teachers' responses showed three themes: workload, portfolio and narrative. Conclusions: Gamification, implemented on a long-term basis, has been found an instructional framework capable of increasing students' motivation towards physical education, beyond the initial 'novelty effect'. Students enjoyed the different approach, and some, despite their young age (seven-eight years), believed that they have learned (which upgrades the education value of the subject). Four of the five elements identified as central to promote meaningful experiences in physical education and sport appeared in this study (Beni, Fletcher, and Ni Chroinin [2017]. 'Meaningful Experiences in Physical Education and Youth Sport: A Review of the Literature.' Quest (grand Rapids, Mich ) 69 (3): 291-312.): social interaction, fun, challenge and learning. Therefore, Gamification has the ingredients to foster significant physical education experiences in different educational levels (primary and secondary education), in students with different social (low, medium and high socio-economic status) and educational backgrounds (urban, rural) and teachers with different expertise on Gamification (novel and experienced). Finally, as expected, teachers showed concern for the workload of the new pedagogical approach.;"[Fernandez-Rio, Javier] Univ Oviedo, Fac Teacher Training & Educ, Asturias, Spain; [de las Heras, Esteban; Trillo, Vanessa] Consejeria Educ Junta Andalucia, Andalucia, Spain; [Gonzalez, Tristan] Consejeria Educ Comunidad Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Palomares, Jorge] Consejeria Educ Generalitat, Cataluna, Spain";Fernandez-Rio, J (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, Fac Teacher Training & Educ, C Aniceto Sela S-N,Despacho 222, Oviedo 33005, Spain.;javier.rio@uniovi.es;Fernandez-Rio, Javier/H-9529-2015;Fernandez-Rio, Javier/0000-0002-1368-3723;NA;NA;NA;55;7;7;23;48;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1740-8989;1742-5786;NA;PHYS EDUC SPORT PEDA;Phys.

Methods A paediatric radiology escape room with accompanying tutorial was developed around key learning objectives set within the RCR and ESR undergraduate curriculum. Students were recruited from two different universities and undertook the escape room themed teaching. An 8-question single best answer (SBA) test was completed before, immediately after and at 2 weeks post-teaching to determine participant improvement and retention of knowledge. The general feedback was also collected. Results The escape room sessions were held three times, for 19 students (6-7 students per session). All groups completed the escape room in <= 20 min. Students enjoyed the experience, assigning an average satisfaction score of 9.4/10 (range 7-10). The majority (17/19, 89.5%) preferred this method of teaching to a lecture-based tutorial alone, although all said they found the tutorial component useful. For the SBA test, there was an average increase in 3.6 marks (range 1-6 marks) per participant between before and after the escape room. This improved knowledge was mostly sustained after 2 weeks, with an average increase of 3.4 marks difference (range 1 to 6) per participant compared to before the teaching. Conclusions A paediatric radiology themed escape room is a feasible teaching method, enjoyed by participants and associated with an increase in radiological knowledge. Further work with larger sample size and direct comparison with other traditional teaching methods is required.;"[Liu, Chantal; Ogunjinmi, Bukola; Briffa, Corey; Coffey, Josephine; Kallam, Neha; Leung, Marco Shiu Tsun; Lim, Annabelle; Tsang, Emily] St Georges Univ London, Cranmer Terrace, London SW17 0T, England; [Patel, Raeesa; Allain-Chapman, Miranda; Shamsad, Sabina; El-Sharnouby, Farah; Whitehead, Jennifer] UCL, Med Sch, 74 Huntley St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Bretherton, Josephine; Ramsay, Lauren; Shelmerdine, Susan C.] Great Ormond St Hosp Children NHS Fdn Trust, London WC1N 3JH, England; [Shelmerdine, Susan C.] UCL Great Ormond St Inst Child Hlth, London WC1N 1EH, England";"Shelmerdine, SC (corresponding author), Great Ormond St Hosp Children NHS Fdn Trust, London WC1N 3JH, England.; Shelmerdine, SC (corresponding author), UCL Great Ormond St Inst Child Hlth, London WC1N 1EH, England.";susie_c_s@yahoo.co.uk;NA;"Shelmerdine, Susan/0000-0001-6642-9967; Liu, Chantal/0000-0001-6984-4576";Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [MR/R002118/1] Funding Source: Medline;NA;NA;27;2;2;2;3;SPRINGEROPEN;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND;1869-4101;NA;NA;INSIGHTS IMAGING;Insights Imaging;mar/19;2020;11;1;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;50;10.1186/s13244-020-00856-9;NA;NA;11;Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging;Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging;KX7DH;WOS:000522037200002;32193698;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the implementation of a mental gamification from blended learning based on the flex model and efficacy of this program on students. METHODS: In this study, with the design of mental illness lessons for undergraduate and executive groups, using flex model, two parts of technical and educational design were used. In the technical section, three parts on dynamics, mechanisms, and elements of gaming were considered. Intervention was studied on different groups of medical students including medical, health, and laboratory sciences. Effect of this educational program and its impact on their students' learning, motivation, and satisfaction was studied using quantitative and qualitative analyses. RESULTS: The results of the students' prospective about the efficacy of the method showed that the mean scores of most of the items were higher than the average. This implies that students' attitude toward using gamification was positive. In the other part, the qualitative results of the study were analyzed and the students' analysis of their advantages and disadvantages and their perceptions on the impact of the intervention was examined. CONCLUSION: Based on the flex model, mental gamification based on blended learning is effective in shaping the students' satisfaction.;"[Mosalanejad, Leili] Jahrom Univ Med Sci, Dept Med Educ, Virtual Ctr, Jahrom, Iran; [Abdian, Tahereh] Jahrom Univ Med Sci, Dept Nursing, Jahrom, Iran; [Abdollahifard, Saeed] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Shiraz, Iran";Abdian, T (corresponding author), Jahrom Univ Med Sci, Dept Nursing, Jahrom, Iran.;tahere.abdian@gmail.com;NA;NA;Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran;This study was financially supported by Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran.;NA;59;1;1;0;0;WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS;MUMBAI;WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, 400059, INDIA;2277-9531;2319-6440;NA;J EDUC HEALTH PROMOT;J.

This article focuses on the design and implementation of gamified leveling-up systems that promote greater student motivation. A previous qualitative study was conducted in which 15 high school teachers were interviewed to discover their perceptions on their use of gamification methods in their curricula. Among all teacher participants, five of them specifically utilized leveling-up systems. I conducted a secondary analysis of a larger qualitative study on the implementation of secondary school educators' use of gamification methods. Some examples of gamified leveling-up frameworks include the use of additional associated applications such as thematic instruction, incentivized point systems, badging, and leaderboards. Results of this secondary analysis helped me identify and define three different models of gamified frameworks.;[McFarland, Jon] Calif State Univ Stanislaus, Turlock, CA 95382 USA;McFarland, J (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Stanislaus, Turlock, CA 95382 USA.;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;53;0;0;0;2;UNIV CHICAGO PRESS;CHICAGO;1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA;1550-1175;2153-0327;NA;SCHOOLS;Schools;mar/01;2020;17;1;NA;NA;NA;NA;115;135;NA;10.1086/708359;NA;NA;21;Education & Educational Research;Education & Educational Research;LS8XZ;WOS:000536664900008;NA;NA;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

An important aspect of virtual worlds relates to the intelligent, embodied pedagogical agents that are employed to enhance the interaction with students and improve their overall learning experience. The proper design and integration of embodied pedagogical agents in virtual learning environments are highly desirable. Although virtual agents constitute a vital part of virtual environments, their exact impact needs are yet to be addressed and assessed. The aim of the present study is to thoroughly examine and deeply understand the effect that embodied pedagogical agents have on the learning experience of students as well as on their performance. We examine how students perceive the role of pedagogical agents as learning companions during specific game-based activities and the effect that their assistance has on students' learning. A concrete experimental study was conducted in AVARES, a 3D virtual world educational environment that teaches the domain of environmental engineering and energy generation. The results of the study point out that embodied pedagogical agents can improve students' learning experience, enhance their engagement with learning activities and, most of all, improve their knowledge construction and performance.;"[Grivokostopoulou, Foteini; Kovas, Konstantinos; Perikos, Isidoros] Univ Patras, Comp Engn & Informat Dept, Patras 26504, Greece";Perikos, I (corresponding author), Univ Patras, Comp Engn & Informat Dept, Patras 26504, Greece.;"grivokwst@ceid.upatras.gr; kobas@ceid.upatras.gr; perikos@ceid.upatras.gr";Perikos, Isidoros/N-1363-2018;Perikos, Isidoros/0000-0002-6581-4676;NA;NA;NA;34;3;3;5;11;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2076-3417;NA;APPL SCI-BASEL;Appl.

The data collection process is through direct observation of tuberculosis patients and health professionals (doctors, nurses, and DOTS health workers). Challenge the game in the prototype was provided with content that contained tuberculosis information that had been previously validated by a specialist. In addition to tuberculosis information as the main content, two important elements are making up this prototype, which are gamification and social media elements. In the game elements, this study adopted elements of the leaderboard, badge/achievement, challenge, and level. As for the third element, social media includes likes, comments, and shares. Prototype application testing was conducted on two participant groups (N = 48) consisting of 23 tuberculosis patients and 25 random participants.

It can rely on different methodologies, including a paper diary and mobile applications. However, the widespread use of mobile applications by teenagers suggests that they could be a more suitable tool for this purpose. This paper reviews the methodologies for promoting physical activities to healthy teenagers explored in different studies, excluding the analysis of different diseases. We found only nine studies working with teenagers and mobile applications to promote active lifestyles, including the focus on nutrition and physical activity. Studies report using different techniques to captivate the teenagers, including questionnaires and gamification techniques. We identified the common features used in different studies, which are: paper diary, diet diary, exercise diary, notifications, diet plan, physical activity registration, gamification, smoking cessation, pictures, game, and SMS, among others.;"[Villasana, Maria Vanessa; Sa, Juliana] Univ Beira Interior, Fac Hlth Sci, P-6200506 Covilha, Portugal; [Pires, Ivan Miguel; Garcia, Nuno M.] Univ Beira Interior, Inst Telecomunicacoes, P-6200001 Covilha, Portugal; [Pires, Ivan Miguel] Polytech Inst Viseu, P-3504510 Viseu, Portugal; [Sa, Juliana] Hosp Ctr Cova Beira, P-6200251 Covilha, Portugal; [Zdravevski, Eftim; Chorbev, Ivan; Lameski, Petre] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Comp Sci & Engn, Skopje 1000, North Macedonia; [Florez-Revuelta, Francisco] Univ Alicante, Dept Comp Technol, POB 99, E-03080 Alicante, Spain";Villasana, MV (corresponding author), Univ Beira Interior, Fac Hlth Sci, P-6200506 Covilha, Portugal.;"maria.vanessa.villasana.abreu@ubi.pt; impires@it.ubi.pt; julianasa@fcsaude.ubi.pt; ngarcia@di.ubi.pt; eftim.zdravevski@finki.ukim.mk; ivan.chorbev@finki.ukim.mk; petre.lameski@finki.ukim.mk; francisco.florez@ua.es";"Garcia, Nuno M./N-1681-2019; Pires, Ivan M/V-3573-2017; Zdravevski, Eftim/K-5276-2014; Florez-Revuelta, Francisco/J-3370-2013";"Garcia, Nuno M./0000-0002-3195-3168; Pires, Ivan M/0000-0002-3394-6762; Zdravevski, Eftim/0000-0001-7664-0168; Florez-Revuelta, Francisco/0000-0002-3391-711X; Sa, Juliana/0000-0002-6776-7789; Villasana, Maria Vanessa/0000-0002-4957-9477";"FCT/MEC; FEDER -PT2020 partnership agreement [UIDB/EEA/50008/2020]; University of Sts.

Active methodologies are presented as an alternative for students to actively build their learning, with the teacher's guidance. Among the active methodologies is gamification, which is presented as a methodology using techniques and structures of the game in non-recreational contexts, to provoke and build learning. This research aims to define and contrast an explanatory model about the personal dimensions that become part of the students with the use of this methodology such as the student's mastery, enjoyment, the absence of negative effect and absorption with respect to creative student thinking. The instrument used is the GAMEX questionnaire, translated and validated by the authors of this manuscript for this context, as a previous investigation to the current one. The results obtained show that there is a positive relationship between all dimensions, that is, the student's mastery, their enjoyment, the absence of a negative effect and the student's absorption with the student's creative thinking. There is also a relationship between the dimensions absence of negative effect and dominance with the enjoyment of the students and between the dominance and the enjoyment of the students with their absorption in learning through gamified experiences.;"[Parra-Gonzalez, Maria E.; Segura-Robles, Adrian] Univ Granada, Granada, Spain; [Morales Cevallos, Maria B.] Univ Catolica Santiago Guayaquil, Guayaquil, Ecuador; [Lopez Meneses, Eloy] Univ Pablo Olavide, Seville, Spain";Parra-Gonzalez, ME (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Granada, Spain.;"elenaparra@ugr.es; adrianseg@ugr.es; mabelenmorales0@gmail.com; elopmen@upo.es";Lopez-Meneses, E./G-1307-2011;"Lopez-Meneses, E./0000-0003-0741-5367; Segura-Robles, Adrian/0000-0003-0753-7129";NA;NA;NA;59;0;0;1;2;RED UNIV CAMPUS VIRTUALES;HUELVA;AVENIDA DE MARZO, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN;2255-1514;NA;NA;CAMPUS VIRTUALES;Campus Virtuales;MAR;2020;9;1;NA;NA;NA;NA;113;123;NA;NA;NA;NA;11;Education & Educational Research;Education & Educational Research;KY4UO;WOS:000522564400010;NA;NA;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

The purpose of this study is to validate an electronic learning or e-learning, concept featuring gamification elements, rapid case reading, and instant feedback. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. An c-learning concept was devised that offered game levels for the purpose of providing training in the detection of pneumothorax in 195 cases, with questions read in rapid succession and instant feedback provided for each case. The user's task was to locate the pneumothorax on chest radiographs and indicate its presence by clicking a mouse. The game level design included an entry test consisting of 15 cases, training levels with increasing difficulty that involved 150 cases, and a final test that including 30 cases (the 15 cases from the entry test plus 15 new cases). A total of 126 candidates were invited via e-mail to participate and were asked to complete a survey before and after playing the game, which is known as RapRad. The level of diagnostic confidence and the error rate before and after playing the game were compared using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS. Fifty-nine of 126 participants (47%) responded to the first survey and finished the game. Of these 59 participants, 29 (49%) responded to the second survey after completing the game. Diagnostic confidence in pneumothorax detection improved significantly, from a mean (+/- SD) score of 4.3 +/- 2.1 on the entry test to a final score of 7.3 +/- 2.1 (p < 0.01) after playing RapRad, with the score measured on a 10-point scale, with 10 denoting the highest possible score. Of the participants, 93% indicated that they would use the game for learning purposes again, and 87% indicated that they had fun using RapRad (7% had a neutral response and 6% had a negative response). The error rate (i.e., the number of failed attempts to answer a question correctly) significantly decreased from 39% for the entry test to 22% for the final test (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION. Our e-learning concept is capable of improving diagnostic confidence, reducing error rates in training pneumothorax detection, and offering fun in interaction with the platform.;"[Winkel, David J.; Brantner, Philipp; Heye, Tobias J.] Univ Hosp Basel, Dept Radiol, Petersgraben 4, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland; [Lutz, Jonas; Korkut, Safak; Linxen, Sebastian] Univ Appl Sci Northwestern Switzerland, Inst Informat Syst, Basel, Switzerland";Winkel, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Basel, Dept Radiol, Petersgraben 4, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland.;davidjean.winkel@usb.ch;NA;Heye, Tobias/0000-0001-9949-0545;NA;NA;NA;15;3;3;0;3;AMER ROENTGEN RAY SOC;LEESBURG;44211 SLATESTONE CT, LEESBURG, VA USA;0361-803X;1546-3141;NA;AM J ROENTGENOL;Am.

Results from random effects models showed significant small effects of gamification on cognitive (g = .49, 95% CI [0.30, 0.69], k = 19, N = 1686), motivational (g = .36, 95% CI [0.18, 0.54], k = 16, N = 2246), and behavioral learning outcomes (g = .25, 95% CI [0.04, 0.46], k = 9, N = 951). Whereas the effect of gamification on cognitive learning outcomes was stable in a subsplit analysis of studies employing high methodological rigor, effects on motivational and behavioral outcomes were less stable. Given the heterogeneity of effect sizes, moderator analyses were conducted to examine inclusion of game fiction, social interaction, learning arrangement of the comparison group, as well as situational, contextual, and methodological moderators, namely, period of time, research context, randomization, design, and instruments. Inclusion of game fiction and social interaction were significant moderators of the effect of gamification on behavioral learning outcomes. Inclusion of game fiction and combining competition with collaboration were particularly effective within gamification for fostering behavioral learning outcomes. Results of the subsplit analysis indicated that effects of competition augmented with collaboration might also be valid for motivational learning outcomes. The results suggest that gamification as it is currently operationalized in empirical studies is an effective method for instruction, even though factors contributing to successful gamification are still somewhat unresolved, especially for cognitive learning outcomes.;"[Sailer, Michael; Homner, Lisa] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Chair Educ & Educ Psychol, Munich, Germany";Sailer, M (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Chair Educ & Educ Psychol, Munich, Germany.;"Michael.Sailer@psy.lmu.de; lisahomner@gmail.com";NA;Sailer, Michael/0000-0001-6831-5429;NA;NA;NA;78;30;30;17;27;SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1040-726X;1573-336X;NA;EDUC PSYCHOL REV;Educ.

Currently, there is a great demand for formal leadership training throughout the extensive medical education curriculum. We constructed an interactive team-building activity utilizing gamification-theory with the Zoom game. The Zoom activity requires a team of learners to organize a set of sequential images, each of which contains a zoomed out section from the previous image, into the correct order within a set time frame. Given the unique and approachable nature of this team-based activity, we propose the following: 1) to introduce the Zoom game as a team-building and communication fostering exercise in undergraduate medical education and 2) to assess baseline teamwork skills of first-year medical students through an immersive gaming experience. With this in mind, 260 first-year medical students (class of 2020) at an urban-city medical school were enrolled in the Zoom Team Building Activity as part of their orientation. The students were randomly assigned to 11 teams, comprising 23-24 students and two faculty facilitators per team and completed the activity in the allotted time frame. The average time to complete the Zoom game was 24 minutes, and all the teams successfully placed the pictures in the correct order. Facilitators noted that the Zoom game strongly encouraged friendly interactions, intercollegiate high values, mutual respect, confidence, and trust among each other. Students observed take-home points such as selecting a leader, designating specific roles, and encouraging closed-loop communication. Overall, the Zoom activity game is an interactive, fun, and easily accessible team-building and communication fostering exercise in undergraduate medical education. Further studies on the Zoom game exercise would be essential to determine whether it has a continuous and enduring effect on developing team building among medical students.;"[Zhang, Xiao Chi; Balakumar, Arjun; Rodriguez, Carlos; Sielicki, Anthony; Papanagnou, Dimitrios] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Emergency Med, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA";Zhang, XC (corresponding author), Thomas Jefferson Univ, Emergency Med, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.;xzhang09@gmail.com;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;18;1;1;0;1;CUREUS INC;PALO ALTO;PO BOX 61002, PALO ALTO, CA 94306 USA;NA;2168-8184;NA;CUREUS;Cureus;FEB 12;2020;12;2;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;e6964;10.7759/cureus.6964;NA;NA;7;Medicine, General & Internal;General & Internal Medicine;KL6AN;WOS:000513504200004;32190511;Other Gold, Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

In this work we demonstrate a way to convey the teaching of parallelism to undergraduate students using gamification in microworlds.

One approach to reducing household food waste is through education campaigns. We recruited 501 households divided into three types of intervention groups and compared with a control group to better understand the efficacy of diverse education campaign approaches. Food waste interventions included a passive approach (handouts), a community engagement approach, and a gamification approach. We conducted waste audits, household surveys (pre- and post-intervention), and a focus group at the end of the campaign. The passive and gamification groups had similarly high levels of participation, while participation in the community group was very low. The passive group and the gamification group had higher self-reported awareness of food wasting after the campaign and lower food wastage than the control group. Waste audits found marginally significant differences between the game group and the control (p = 0.07) and no difference between the other campaign groups and the control group in edible food wasted. Frequent gamers were found to generate less edible food waste than infrequent gamers. We conclude that the evidence about the potential for gamification as an effective education change tool is promising and we recommend further study.;"[Soma, Tammara] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC M5S 3G3, Canada; [Li, Belinda] Simon Fraser Univ, Food Syst Lab, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Maclaren, Virginia] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada";Soma, T (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC M5S 3G3, Canada.;"tammara_soma@sfu.ca; belinda_li@sfu.ca; maclaren@geog.utoronto.ca";NA;"Li, Belinda/0000-0003-2512-5689; Soma, Tammara/0000-0002-4273-1165";"George Weston Ltd.; Loblaw Companies Ltd. through the Seeding Food Innovation Grant program";We gratefully acknowledge funding from George Weston Ltd. and Loblaw Companies Ltd. through the Seeding Food Innovation Grant program.;NA;44;3;3;7;12;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2071-1050;NA;SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL;Sustainability;FEB;2020;12;3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;907;10.3390/su12030907;NA;NA;19;"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies";"Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology";KT6PA;WOS:000519135103010;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

It focuses specifically on Global Footprint Network's personal Footprint calculator, and aims to understand the profile of calculator users and assess the contribution of calculators to increasing individual awareness and encouraging sustainable choices. Our survey of 4245 respondents show that 75% of users resided in 10 countries, 54% were aged 18-34 years and had largely used the calculator within an educational context (62%). The calculator was considered a valuable tool for knowledge generation by 91% of users, and 78% found it useful to motivate action. However, only 23% indicated the calculator provided them with the necessary information to make actual changes to their life and reduce their personal Footprint. The paper discusses how and why this personal Footprint calculator has been effective in enhancing individuals' understanding of the environmental impact of their actions, framing the scale of the problem and empowering users to understand the impacts of different lifestyle choices. Those individual-level and system-level changes needed to generate global sustainability outcomes are also discussed. Similar to other calculators, a gap is also identified in terms of this calculator facilitating individuals to convert new knowledge into action.;"[Collins, Andrea] Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Cardiff, Wales; [Galli, Alessandro] Global Footprint Network, Ave Louis Casai 18, CH-1209 Geneva, Switzerland; [Hipwood, Tara] Northumbria Univ, Sch Architecture& Built Environm, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Murthy, Adeline] Global Footprint Network, 1528 Webster St,Suite 11, Oakland, CA 94612 USA";"Collins, A (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Cardiff, Wales.; Galli, A (corresponding author), Global Footprint Network, Ave Louis Casai 18, CH-1209 Geneva, Switzerland.";"CollinsA@cardiff.ac.uk; alessandro.galli@footprintnetwork.org";"Hipwood, Tara/AAI-6168-2020; Galli, Alessandro/AAV-5906-2020";"Hipwood, Tara/0000-0001-6102-8398; Collins, Andrea/0000-0002-6195-468X";MAVA Foundation;Authors would like to thank the MAVA Foundation for its generous support to the National Footprint Accounts.

Location-based games (geogames) have been established following mainly a 'seek-and-find' game-mechanic, challenging mechanics like simulations are rarely used. We describe an approach for creating an educational location-based game (geogame). The central design problem consists in integrating an ecological simulation into the location-based game flow. We show how to combine these two game mechanics by simplifying complex simulations while maintaining their validity. In an empirical study we evaluate our geogame with secondary school students (N = 329). Our quasi-experimental pre-post-test design focuses on the game-related enjoyment provided by a simplified simulation task within a geogame compared to a more complex desktop simulation and to a geogame without simulation. The results show that the players of the Geogame spend much less time on interacting with the simulation than on other tasks. Nevertheless, the simulation within the geogame contributes positively to the game playing experience. Player enjoyment is even found to be slightly higher in the simulation geogame than in the indoor simulation. A critical threshold of time for using simulations within location-based game mechanics is discussed and related design-pattern for geogames are presented to support educators and game developers in the co-design of challenging location-based games. This study contributes to locate ecological simulations in areas where they actually take place. Complex topics and competencies in education become real for players in an outdoor experience.;"[Schneider, Joachim] Univ Educ Ludwigsburg, Ludwigsburg, Germany; [Schaal, Steffen] Univ Educ Ludwigsburg, Biol & Biol Educ, Ludwigsburg, Germany; [Schlieder, Christoph] Univ Bamberg, Appl Comp Sci, Bamberg, Germany; [Schlieder, Christoph] Univ Bamberg, Res Grp Cultural Informat, Bamberg, Germany";Schneider, J (corresponding author), Univ Educ Ludwigsburg, Ludwigsburg, Germany.;schneidejoach@stud.ph-ludwigsburg.de;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;69;1;1;5;14;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1380-7501;1573-7721;NA;MULTIMED TOOLS APPL;Multimed.

Methods: The Surveys of Multi-Modality Imaging course is a two-credit hour elective course offered to third-year PharmD and doctoral students. Experiential learning methods including active learning application-based exercises were used to supplement didactic lectures in the form of field trips (with follow-up debriefings), small group team-based tasks, hands-on demonstrations, visual modelling, gamification with problem sets, concept maps regarding given modalities, and concluding with written summary reports and formal in-class group presentations. In addition to standard course evaluations, a pre- and post-course survey were conducted to assess the students' confidence regarding course content. Results: Since its implementation in 2013, 101 students have completed the course with 72% being PharmD students (n = 73) and the remainder being doctoral students in pharmaceutical science (n = 28). Pre- and post-assessments completed by the students the last two offerings (n = 40 of a possible 43) indicated a shift in students' self-reported confidence in discussing imaging modalities from a total of 2.4% confidence (pre-course) to 97.4% confidence (postcourse). Also, post-course survey indicated that 77.5% (n = 31 of 40 participants) students strongly agreed that our immersive and experiential learning activities were beneficial to overall learning for this elective. Conclusion: Students who participated in this innovative experiential learning-grounded course gained an appreciation for molecular imaging and its value and role in modern drug therapy.;"[Whitman, Christopher; Kamath, Sainath; Lawrence, Shelby; Whisenant, David; Sport, Susannah; Sidwell, Walter; Mitchell, Adam; Osbourne, Easton; Bolina, Jasleen; Gill, Kristina; Finley, Christopher; Lambson, David; Wood, Trent] Auburn Univ, Harrison Sch Pharm, 362 West Thach Ave, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Panizzi, Jennifer R.] Auburn Univ, Coll Vet Med, Dept Anat Physiol & Pharmacol, 212 Greene Hall,1130 Wire Rd, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Blackwell, Kristina T.

The effects of the instructional intervention (n = 94), as well as evaluative feedback, were obtained with the aid of formative quizzes, post-questionnaire surveys, and personal interviews. The results showed that the employment of innovative gamified e-quiz applications (i.e., Socrative, Quizizz, and iSpring Learn LMS) and paper-based quizzes were effective in evaluating students' learning performance, particularly as formative assessment after completing each topic.

Direct interactions with diversity still contribute to feelings of trust, only demographic differences now prevent the requisite contact from occurring. New means of creating shared experiences have thus become more vital, and the present study tests the value of games-based role-playing for fostering trust in immigrant populations. Students in an online American Government class at a major southeastern university were asked to create a fictional persona from Mexico, India, or China, and seek US citizenship. Their success or failure factored into their overall grade. Results suggest that role-playing the administrative experience of immigrants contributes to trusting them over time.

Collective intelligence could potentially decrease the error rates of nonexperts. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and impact of collective intelligence for the detection of skin cancer. Methods: We created a gamified study platform on a stack of established Web technologies and presented 4216 dermatoscopic images of the most common benign and malignant pigmented skin lesions to 1245 human raters with different levels of experience. Raters were recruited via scientific meetings, mailing lists, and social media posts. Education was self-declared, and domain-specific experience was tested by screening tests. In the target test, the readers had to assign 30 dermatoscopic images to 1 of the 7 disease categories. The readers could repeat the test with different lesions at their own discretion. Collective human intelligence was achieved by sampling answers from multiple readers. The disease category with most votes was regarded as the collective vote per image. Results: We collected 111,019 single ratings, with a mean of 25.2 (SD 18.5) ratings per image. As single raters, nonexperts achieved a lower mean accuracy (58.6%) than experts (68.4%; mean difference=-9.4%; 95% CI -10.74% to -8.1%; P<.001). Collectives of nonexperts achieved higher accuracies than single raters, and the improvement increased with the size of the collective. A collective of 4 nonexperts surpassed single nonexperts in accuracy by 6.3% (95% CI 6.1% to 6.6%; P<.001). The accuracy of a collective of 8 nonexperts was 9.7% higher (95% CI 9.5% to 10.29%; P<.001) than that of single nonexperts, an improvement similar to single experts (P=.73). The sensitivity for malignant images increased for nonexperts (66.3% to 77.6%) and experts (64.6% to 79.4%) for answers given faster than the intrarater mean. Conclusions: A high number of raters can be attracted by elements of gamification and Web-based marketing via mailing lists and social media. Nonexperts increase their accuracy to expert level when acting as a collective, and faster answers correspond to higher accuracy.

Methods Seventy-four primary education teachers and their 2069 students were randomly assigned to three groups. The first group of teachers (n = 23) were trained to use a face-to-face method. The objective of the training was that the teachers would be able to implement EI into their teaching to improve academic achievement in their students (n = 645) using face-to-face instruction. For the second group (n = 28), the teachers were trained to use an e-learning gamification method. Similar to the first group, the objective of the training was that the teachers would be able to implement EI into their teaching to improve academic achievement in their students (n = 758) using e-learning gamification instruction. The third group of teachers (n = 23) served as the controls and did not receive any special training, nor did they implement EI into their teaching (n = 666). Results Implementation of EI into classroom teaching effectively improved academic achievement in primary school students using both methods. However, there was a greater increase in academic achievement and higher teacher satisfaction in the game-based e-learning group. No significant differences in student achievement were observed in the control group.

We used well-established measures with appropriate psychometric properties. The study used a quasi-experimental design of pre-test/post-test repeated measurements with a control group. First, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and then descriptive analyses and variance analyses (ANOVAs) were carried out by the adolescents randomly assigned to the experimental and control conditions. Then, a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was performed on the study's variables as a whole. Descriptive and covariance analyses of the post-test scores were carried out (ANCOVAs post-test, co-varying pre-test scores), in order to demonstrate the impact of the program. The effect size was reckoned (Cohen's d). The results confirm statistically-significant differences in: Health-Related Quality of life, positive affect and mental health. The study provides an effective intervention tool which has been experimentally validated. The overall results allow for emphasizing the importance of the implementation of programs aimed at encouraging social and emotional learning throughout adolescence as protective resources in fostering emotional and behavioral adjustment in adolescents.;"[Cejudo, Javier] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Educ Ciudad Real, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain; [Losada, Lidia] UNED, Fac Educ, Dept Res Methods & Assessment Educ 2, Juan Rosal 14, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Feltrero, Roberto] Higher Teacher Training Inst Salome Urena, Calle Caonabo, Santo Domingo 10114, Dominican Rep";Losada, L (corresponding author), UNED, Fac Educ, Dept Res Methods & Assessment Educ 2, Juan Rosal 14, Madrid 28040, Spain.;"manueljavier.cejudo@uclm.es; llosada@edu.uned.es; rfeltrero@fsof.uned.es";"Cejudo, Javier/F-1427-2016; LOSADA, LIDIA/AAC-5103-2020; LOSADA, LIDIA/H-8443-2016; Feltrero, Roberto/AAN-6804-2020";"Cejudo, Javier/0000-0002-2381-0714; LOSADA, LIDIA/0000-0003-3513-6162; LOSADA, LIDIA/0000-0003-3513-6162; Feltrero, Roberto/0000-0002-2224-2807";Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Welfare of Spain;Aislados is a program designed by the Interdisciplinary Service for Attention to Drug Addiction, is part of the National Drug Plan Program and has been funded by the Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Welfare of Spain.;NA;72;3;3;4;7;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;1660-4601;NA;INT J ENV RES PUB HE;Int.

To do so, we created a gamified security training system focusing on two factors: (1) enhancing intrinsic motivation through gamification and (2) improving security learning and efficacy. Our key theoretical contribution is proposing a recontextualized kernel theory from the hedonic-motivation system adoption model that can be used to assess employee security constructs along with their intrinsic motivations and coping for learning and compliance. A six-month field study with 420 participants shows that fulfilling users' motivations and coping needs through gamified security training can result in statistically significant positive behavioral changes.

The following conclusions were inferred: By turning learning into a game we may prompt students to perceive the world-of-work (duties, responsibilities) as the world-of-play (desires, freedom); then, either the school will lose its socializing role in preparing students for life, which is a world of work and commitments rather than a world of game, or students will become bored with the game that will lose its appeal (or suggest manipulations).

This has proven to be a bad idea in some cases, for the simple reason that practice is required to learn basic arithmetic skills. Drills in arithmetic skills can be made interesting through gamification. This study proposes a family of puzzles that gamify arithmetic practice. The puzzles are designed with an evolutionary algorithm forming an instance of automatic content generation. Two methods of evolutionary puzzle design are presented and discussed. The first method used transformed the problem into an almost trivial optimization. The second algorithm was designed to avoid the flaws of the first and produced a huge variety of puzzles. A hardness measure, based on the difficulty experienced by the evolutionary puzzle generator, is employed. The hardness measure is tested on a large collection of puzzles produced with the evolutionary automatic content generation system. An initial assumption, that all the pieces in the puzzle must be used to achieve a maximum score, was shown to be incorrect in puzzles located via automatic search. Two classes of puzzle are defined: those where the optimal solution uses all pieces and those where the optimal solution fails to use at least one piece. The latter sort of puzzle were found to be far more common in the search space.;"[Foxcroft, Jeremy] Univ Guelph, Sch Comp Sci, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Ashlock, Daniel] Univ Guelph, Dept Math & Stat, Guelph, ON, Canada";Foxcroft, J (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Sch Comp Sci, Guelph, ON, Canada.;jfoxcrof@uoguelph.ca;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;26;0;0;0;0;IOS PRESS;AMSTERDAM;NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;1389-6911;2468-2438;NA;ICGA J;ICGA J.;NA;2020;42;4;NA;NA;NA;NA;272;286;NA;10.3233/ICG-200170;NA;NA;15;Computer Science, Software Engineering;Computer Science;PS2TB;WOS:000607779200004;NA;NA;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

'Kahoot' is one of such student response systems and one of the primary applications that can be utilised for the purposes such as gamification, formative assessment and peer learning procedures. Such applications are widely used for the purposes of bringing a gamification in the education industry nowadays. The primary purpose of this research is to determine the opinions of teachers who are active in the education industry and their experience in using 'Kahoot' as a teaching aid in bringing the diversification in the industry. In this study, a semi-structured interview form was used as a data collection tool. Opinions of prospective teachers participating in the study was taken into consideration to form an end conclusion of this research study. The research data also involves a semi-structured student opinion form, and a procedure of content analysis was undertaken in the analysis of the data. The study group of the research consists of 38 teacher candidates studying in Kazan (Volga region) Federal University, Institute of Legislation and Comparative Law under the Government of the Russian Federation, Plekhanov Russian University of Economics and Sechenov University. As a result of the study performed over the set of teachers and students, it was concluded that the 'Kahoot' program is widely beneficial for students and teachers. It was also concluded that the Kahoot program is helpful in eliminating the deficiencies in learning. However, one of the shortcomings of the 'Kahoot' program is that it is an internet-based programme. Hence it may be problematic for some of the students to use the programme who have less knowledge in the internet domain. At the end of the study, a positive set of opinions about the Kahoot program was suggested, which majorly revolved around the idea that the programme is not internet based.;"[Uzunboylu, Huseyin] Higher Educ Planning Accreditat & Coordinat Board, Nicosia, North Cyprus, Turkey; [Galimova, Elvira G.] Kazan Fed Univ, Kazan, Russia; [Kurbanov, Rashad A.] Inst Legislat & Comparat Law Govt Russian Federat, Dept Legal Basis Econ Act, 34 Cheryomushkinskaya St, Moscow 117218, Russia; [Belyalova, Asiya M.] Inst Legislat & Comparat Law Govt Russian Federat, Int Cooperat Dept, 34 Cheryomushkinskaya St, Moscow 117218, Russia; [Deberdeeva, Nelia A.] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Dept Psychol, 36 Stremyannyi Pereulok, Moscow 115093, Russia; [Timofeeva, Mariia] First Moscow State Med Univ, Moscow, Russia";Uzunboylu, H (corresponding author), Higher Educ Planning Accreditat & Coordinat Board, Nicosia, North Cyprus, Turkey.;"huseyin.uzunboylu@gmail.com; elyagalimowa@yandex.ru; mos-ssp@mail.ru; asyulya@mail.ru; debnelya@yandex.ru; timmaria@mail.ru";Timofeeva, Mariia/AAL-1126-2021;NA;NA;NA;NA;35;0;0;1;1;KASSEL UNIV PRESS GMBH;KASSEL;DIAGONALE 10, D-34127 KASSEL, GERMANY;1863-0383;NA;NA;INT J EMERG TECHNOL;Int.

Yet, there is a consensus that CS has serious conundrums particularly in attracting students, low motivation for learning computer programming and developing computational thinking (CT) skills. New motivational methods are needed to take the attention of students and adapt to their learning patterns as how people learn have changed drastically over the last two decades. To address these issues, video games and video game-based tools are proposed as a primary approach for motivating and supporting students in developing their skills in CT and support their learning of introductory programming. This research is concerned with the capture of statistical evidence on the educational effectiveness of playing a serious game specifically designed to enhance the development of CT skills to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. A total of 190 students were invited to participate in a quasi-experimental pre-post study for the purpose of analyzing the impact of an adhoc game on students' confidence in learning programming constructs and using their skills in CT. All students were studying a CS degree at the time and they were all registered to a first-year computer programming course. 151 out of 190 students successfully completed the study and the findings suggest that a) the intrinsic motivation to learn programming; b) students' perception of their knowledge and their tangible knowledge in key programming constructs (i.e. programming sequence, methods, decision making and loops); and c) students' confidence in using their CT skills were all statistically and significantly improved after playing the game.

The consequence of this is a massive transition to e-learning, both in the native language and in English, which, however, creates psychological and pedagogical problems. These are difficulties for students with self-organization and self-training, establishing interpersonal contacts, maintaining the motivation to learn, and meeting a certain level of foreign language proficiency. The problems for teachers include the need to develop new teaching methods and technologies, changing the role of the teacher and the methods of interaction between participants in the educational process. The article presents the experience of mitigating these problems in the online course, Fundamentals of Vehicle Certification in Ukrainian and English by using active learning methods, innovative methods of motivation, and organization of reflection and communication, presenting some sections both in the native and foreign language. The introduction of this course into the educational process in the extramural form of education showed that the methods proposed by the authors reduced these problems, while the number of A and B grades increased.

Such online environments offer alternatives to traditional learning, which is now considered expensive, and time-consuming with varying results. Student disengagement is reported as the main problem for higher education e-learning platforms. E-learning developers employ Gamification to counteract this issue. A plethora of game elements are used in the gamification of e-learning. On the other hand, there are various learning activities used in e-learning platforms. Based on a literature-based analysis, this study thus identifies several game elements suitable for inclusion in learning activities in e-learning platforms to improve student engagement. This identified the most commonly used game elements, and a subsequent questionnaire survey examined real user perspectives on these elements. As a result, a conceptual engagement framework outlining how game elements might be used to support e-learning activities to engage students is proposed. The framework is intended to be used as a guideline for developers and academics seeking to build engaging e-learning systems based on good foundational concepts. The paper thus presents a short review of existing e-learning gamification frameworks and the steps taken towards the identification of commonly used game elements. Learning activities and student engagement factors usually employed in e-learning platforms are subsequently discussed in relation to the development of the proposed conceptual engagement framework for gamified e-learning activities.;"[Alsubhi, Mohammed Abdulaziz; Wook, Tengku Siti Meriam Tengku] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia; [Sahari, Noraidah] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Ctr Software Technol & Management, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, Bangi 43600, Malaysia";Alsubhi, MA (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia.;"P91209@siswa.ukm.edu.my; nsa@ukm.edu.my; tsmeriam@ukm.edu.my";NA;NA;Center for Software Technology and Management, Faculty of Information Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia;This work is supported by The Center for Software Technology and Management, Faculty of Information Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.;NA;87;0;0;1;1;KASSEL UNIV PRESS GMBH;KASSEL;DIAGONALE 10, D-34127 KASSEL, GERMANY;1863-0383;NA;NA;INT J EMERG TECHNOL;Int.

This means that this knowledge has been acquired fast and superficially. Thus, discernment turns into something ephemeral, because there is not a profound examination of the aspects dealt with. This is caused by the enormous quantity of information found that, in many cases, does not reflect reality. In this sense, teachers can find multitasking students that can perform many activities but without reflexively undertaking them. Education tries to solve these type of problems so the learning-teaching process is as significant as possible. Therefore, future teachers should always have tools for keeping students' attention, as well as to raise interest in the studied subjects. Within these new tools, escape rooms are, because they not only increase students' motivation but also encourage teamwork and reflexive learning, as the tasks to be solved are complex. However, as male and female present different perspectives towards gamification, in this work, escape rooms have been studied applying a gender perspective. In the University of Seville, Spain, a descriptive-interpretative exploratory study took place intending to analyse future female teachers' conceptions about escape rooms. A 17-item questionnaire was applied to 99 female students of the Degree in Primary Education. Results show that subjects highly valued the ludic part of the escape rooms as a didactic activity, which fosters significant learning. Students also appreciated that the activity was close to their reality and that it was integrating students' interests in the Primary Education classroom. The main conclusion of the study is that, even if there is room for improvement and there is a need to make them more appealing to female students, escape rooms are considered an excellent educative resource as well as an adequate alternative teaching methodology.;"[Hunt-Gomez, Coral, I; Moreno-Fernandez, Olga; Moreno-Crespo, Pilar; Ferreras-Listan, Mario] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain";Hunt-Gomez, CI (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Seville, Spain.;"coralhuntg@us.es; omoreno@us.es; pmcrespo@us.es; mferreras@us.es";Hunt-Gomez, Coral I/D-2511-2014;Hunt-Gomez, Coral I/0000-0001-6261-927X;Plan Propio de Docencia of the Universidad de Sevilla [22824];This research project is part of the Innovation Project 'Los Escape rooms y los Breakouts como estrategias didacticas para el abordaje de problemas sociales y ambientales en la formaci6n inicial de los profesionales de la educaciOn', with code 22824, granted by competitive tendering by the Plan Propio de Docencia of the Universidad de Sevilla for the academic year 2019/2020.;NA;42;0;0;0;0;UNIV WOLLONGONG;WOLLONGONG;NORTHFIELDS AVE, WOLLONGONG, NSW 2522, AUSTRALIA;1449-9789;NA;NA;J UNIV TEACH LEARN P;J.

Faced with persistent physical symptoms and debilitating social consequences, patients follow complex treatment regimens and often have difficulty adhering to them. Purpose: In this manuscript, we review factors which contribute to low adherence rates and advance potential single- and multi-factor-based interventions. It is hoped that these observations can lead to improvements in managed care of this vulnerable population of patients. Methods: A narrative review of the primary literature was performed on contributing factors with primary focus on the period 2015-2020 using available databases and search engines. Adherence pain points identified were mapped against a series of potential solutions which are presented. Results: Enhancement of treatment adherence relies on two approaches viz. single-factor and multi-factor solutions. Single factors identified include electronic reminders, enhanced health education, financial incentives, gamification strategies, community drivers, persona-based modeling, and burden relief of poly pharmacy. Multi-factor solutions combine two or more of the seven approaches offering the potential for flexible interventions tailored to the individual. Discussion and Conclusion: Heart failure patients with poor adherence have increased mortality, hospitalization needs, and healthcare costs. This review highlights current single-factor and multi-factor adherence methods. Against a backdrop of diversity of approaches, multi-factor solutions cast the widest net for positively influencing adherent behaviors. A key enabler lies in the development and leveraging of patient personas in the synthesis of successful intervention methods. Deployable solutions can also be envisioned in clinical trials where adherence tracking represents an essential component.;"[Makris, Eleanna; Hu, Lucy; Jones, Graham B.; Wright, Justin M.] Novartis Pharmaceut, TRD Innovat Grp, E Hanover, NJ 07936 USA; [Jones, Graham B.] Tufts Univ, Clin & Translat Sci Inst, Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02111 USA";"Jones, GB (corresponding author), Novartis Pharmaceut, TRD Innovat Grp, E Hanover, NJ 07936 USA.; Jones, GB (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Clin & Translat Sci Inst, Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02111 USA.";graham.jones@novartis.com;NA;NA;TRD Innovation Program;We warmly thank the TRD Innovation Program for support of this work.;NA;81;0;0;0;0;DOVE MEDICAL PRESS LTD;ALBANY;PO BOX 300-008, ALBANY, AUCKLAND 0752, NEW ZEALAND;1177-889X;NA;NA;PATIENT PREFER ADHER;Patient Prefer.

However, there is a lack of evidence showing the most suitable and effective game element instilled in the GBL STEM application. Most of the papers studied on GBL have proven the effectiveness aspect in other STEM subjects, however very little discussed in the domain of sustainable energy Thus, this study aimed to analyse the most common game element applied in designing GBL that achieved the best result for students in learning the STEM subjects. Each game element targeted a different kind of learning results such as student's learning performance, knowledge level, cognitive effect, and enjoyment. A systematic review was conducted following the specification of the PRISMA checklist to examine past studies. After carefully screening the articles, only twelve published articles met the specification. The finding showed that most common game elements included in designing the GBL, dominated by the level of challenges, followed by rewards/items, feedback, clear goal and time pressure. The finding also included the percentage of most STEM subject studied in GBL and the impact from the GBL STEM application.

This raises to surface what many studies have addressed earlier; creating a platform that completes the traditional classroom work and maximizes the effectiveness of learning outcomes. Striving to achieve such platform, studies have considered gamifying and personalizing the educational resources for the adaptation of educational systems as per the intended learners through intensive learning analytics. But was the learner really a part of the adaptation process taking place? Learning analytics are usually designed to the course's adaptation and solely for the teachers. Thus, learning analytics in gamified adaptive educational systems involving the course, teachers and learners together are still under investigation. In this study, the Personalized Adaptive Gamified E-learning (PAGE) model is introduced to extend MOOCs by providing new satisfactory levels of learning analytics and visualization in the rich e-learning process that supports the learner's intervention in the resultant learning analytics. The proposed Learning analytics have been developed to make the necessary adaptation to the course and learner's learning flow, as well as visualizing the process and adaptation decisions to the learners. Results show a positive potential towards learning adaptation and visualization, and a necessity to provide an additional focus for the gamification concept.";"[Maher, Yara; Khalifa, M.

However, the benefit and implementation of such gaming platforms are not clearly studied. This analysis assesses the feasibility of Kahoot! regarding simplicity and low-cost performance as a learning/teaching tool for medical education in (histo-)pathology. Materials and Methods: In this feasibility pilot study, we developed 36 modules for different benign and malignant tumors, covering four major topics: gastrointestinal tract, dermatology, urogenital tract, and hematology. Each module included histomorphological text-based questions for education of 2nd-year medical students. The online gaming-platform Kahoot! was anonymously implemented before and after classical medical education which included discussions of histological slides for each tumor entity using Microsoft PowerPoint-based presentations in combination with microscopical demonstrations. Participating students were invited to a seven-questions evaluation about the online educational approach. Results: Overall, 23 of 51 students of the study class completed the pre- and the post-evaluation of Kahoot! in one or more organ systems. The percentage of correct answers increased from the initial mean/median of 47.2/45% to 77.2/76.3%. Simultaneously, the time for answering questions decreased by roughly 50% (from mean/median time of 9.1/8.3 seconds to 5.1/4.3 seconds) from pre- to post-assessment. The results were independent of gender; however, there were scoring differences between the different organ systems. Students positively evaluated the routine implementation of the gaming-platform Kahoot! within medical education. Conclusion: Kahoot! is as a simple, direct, and low-cost application in medical teaching improving learning outcomes of pathomorphological topics with high acceptance by students.

This study investigates whether the use of ERPsim games can be extended to other management disciplines. More specifically, this study reports on using the ERPsim games innovatively in a new context, in an undergraduate managerial decision making course, to enhance student perceived learning outcomes and satisfaction. Background In this study, the ERPsim games were used to provide students with practical experience about using information in tactical and operational decision making and to illustrate important course concepts such as anchoring, bias, and bounded awareness, among others. The theoretical framework leveraged in this study was derived from the literature on technology acceptance in educational settings and the studies on virtual learning environment effectiveness. Methodology Survey methodology was used to collect the data and test the research model. One sample t-tests and partial least squares (PLS) were used for empirical analysis. 138 students participated in the study. Contribution By developing and testing a sound research model, we conclude that the use of ERPsim games can be successfully extended from their current domain of Information Systems to management courses that are not technical to enhance student understanding of managerial concepts in a fun and enjoyable way while enabling students to gain realistic practical experience in using information for decision making. While, the ERPsim games have been used in IS education; this paper presents an opportunity to use them in a different context. Findings The study confirms that the ERPsim games are useful in improving student perceived learning outcomes and the level of satisfaction in management courses. It also identifies the factors that directly or indirectly shape student learning outcomes and satisfaction in such courses. Recommendations for Practitioners The use of the simulations has relevance to the new Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) guidelines that emphasize the need to incorporate evidence based, technology and data-driven decision making to solve real-world business problems into business curriculum. The study should also encourage educators to innovate in their own courses by experimenting with this particular simulation or similar simulations. Recommendation for Researchers Researchers should use additional samples to increase the generalizability of the findings.

During recent decades, much attention has been paid to video games and the multifarious ways in which they can promote and enhance learning. My main objective in this study is to weave game principles, learning and the notion of playfulness into assessment principles, in an attempt to investigate how what I call 'Game-Informed Playful Assessment' (GIPA) can affect student learning and particularly students' experienceoflearning. The GIPA was designed with a view to promoting students' agency, autonomy, collaboration and playfulness, and was introduced in an undergraduate course on Archaic Greek Lyric poetry at a Greek-speaking university. My data was generated through in-depth interviews with ten of the students that attended the course. While the GIPA was favourably and even enthusiastically received by students, the research also brought to the fore several other issues that call for attention, such as the stress that innovative assessment may provoke in students, and the readiness of students to be playful within an academic framework that typically contrasts serious work with playfulness and play in general.;NA;NA;m.pavlou@theo.ac.cy;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;79;0;0;0;0;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;CAMBRIDGE;EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND;1741-7627;2058-6310;NA;J CLASS TEACH;J.

Other enterprises prefer to adopt voluntary courses or programs, but in this case enrollment and completion depend on many factors: the time that workers can spend on training without compromising their main tasks; the directives of managers; the individual motivation. Another way to face corporate training may exploit gamification to enhance engagement.

Methods: The authors designed a role-playing simulation activity that aims to highlight the multidimensional nature of health and develop in students an appreciation of the day-to-day experiences of underserved populations. The current investigation aimed to evaluate the utility of the role-playing activity and guided reflection in terms of the students' appreciation of economic factors that affect health and health-seeking behavior of patients and their recognition of the role of healthcare professionals with respect to issues related to poverty and health. Thematic analyses of the insights and observations of the students immediately after the activity and the anonymized reflection papers were done to identify recurring ideas that made an impression on them. Results: The students were able to identify that in a setting with limited employment opportunities and low-income potential, the residents prioritized food and shelter over everything else. They also chose cheaper products over healthier options. Practically everyone forewent out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure in order to minimize its disruptive consequences. In these settings, the students highlighted the role of society and government in the provision of services and in community development. The students also emphasized the necessity for competition among a number of providers of goods and services to reduce prices. When asked if healthcare professionals are contributing to the widening gap between rich and poor, 70% agreed, 9% disagreed, 14% did not give a direct answer, and 7% said that healthcare professionals contributed in some ways and alleviated in other ways. The most commonly cited behavior that contribute to this disparity are the decision to seek highly specialized training, the congregation of practitioners in highly urbanized centers, and inattention to the economic difficulties of most patients. Those who disagreed with the statement cited systemic problems as the driving force that widens the disparity. In particular, these students cited the commodification of healthcare and related services, inappropriate policies, and insufficient funding specifically for services and health human resources. Conclusion: The evolving landscape in healthcare financing requires more preparation among our medical students and trainees. Innovative strategies such as role-playing activities and guided reflection are useful in demonstrating economic factors that influence health and promote better understanding of externalities that shape the health status of individuals and communities.;"[Loyola, Aldrin B.; Palileo-Villanueva, Lia M.] Univ Philippines Manila, Coll Med, Dept Med, Manila, Philippines";Loyola, AB (corresponding author), Univ Philippines Manila, Dept Med, 547 Pedro Gil St, Manila 1000, Philippines.;abloyola@up.edu.ph;NA;Palileo-Villanueva, Lia/0000-0002-4635-140X;Academic Program Improvement grant from the University of the Philippines;This study was funded by an Academic Program Improvement grant from the University of the Philippines.;NA;35;0;0;0;0;DOVE MEDICAL PRESS LTD;ALBANY;PO BOX 300-008, ALBANY, AUCKLAND 0752, NEW ZEALAND;1179-7258;NA;NA;ADV MED EDUC PRACT;Adv.

Generation Z students embody some features that are requiring new ways to understand the learning process along with new tools to stimulate it. Under those circumstances gamification can offer one of its greatest virtues: rectify and increase the motivation levels of a whole group that reveals a notoriously low implication in class. This article specifies who are the individuals shaping Generation Z by explaining their characteristics and analyzes how these attributes reorient their learning attitude. Furthermore, it contextualizes the role of technology and digital tools within current teaching methods.

This study introduces perceived instructor presence as a way to promote such interactions and investigates its effects on student learning experience in online learning. Background Drawing upon theories of constructivism and social presence, this study proposes a research model to explore the causal relationships from the interactivity of a communication tool to the perception of instructor presence and to student learning experiences such as engagement and satisfaction. Methodology The survey method was used to collect data from online business classes where an interactive communication tool was required to use for class communication and collaboration. Partial Least Squares analysis was used as the primary data analysis tool. Contribution This study introduces perceived instructor presence in the online learning context and empirically tests its effects on the online learning experience. This study also contributes to the online learning literature by confirming the constructivist's point of view on learning that interactions lead to better learning experiences, in the online learning environment. Findings The study results show that the use of an interactive communication tool in online learning fosters strong student-instructor interactions and promotes students' perceptions of instructor presence, which eventually enhances student engagement and satisfaction in online classes. Recommendations for Practitioners This study recommends practitioners (e.g., teachers and professors) to use more interactive communication tools such as Microsoft Teams and Slack to promote the instructor presence in their online classes, which ultimately increase student engagement and satisfaction. Practitioners are also recommended to develop and use any other teaching methods or activities that can increase perceived instructor presence, which has a direct impact on student engagement in online learning. Recommendations for Researchers While the fellow researchers can take one of the future research directions in this paper, it is recommended to consider more fundamental approaches to the study of online learning. For example, the concept of presence is a radical difference when courses are moved from face-to-face to online learning. Future research could investigate how various types of presence can play differently in online learning. Impact on Society Better learning experiences are likely to have a significant impact on society's well-being, and the findings of this study suggest how student learning experiences can be improved in online classes. Furthermore, this is particularly useful when many face-to-face classes were forced to switch to online classes abruptly during the COVID-19 pandemic as many students, parents, and educators were concerned with online learning experiences. Future Research A replication study with different communication tools in various courses would be good future research to support the generalizability of the findings. Another interesting future research is to employ other types of dependent variables, such as tool adoption and academic performance. It would be worth investigating how different types of learning experiences can be associated with various learning tools. As this study finds that an interactive communication tool is associated with student engagement, gamification can be associated with student enjoyment in online learning.;"[Park, ChongWoo] Augusta Univ, Augusta, GA 30912 USA; [Kim, Dong-gook] Dalton State Coll, Dalton, GA USA";Park, C (corresponding author), Augusta Univ, Augusta, GA 30912 USA.;"chopark@augusta.edu; dkim@daltonstate.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;45;1;1;5;8;INFORMING SCIENCE INST;SANTA ROSA;131 BROOKHILL CT, SANTA ROSA, CA 95409 USA;1547-9714;1539-3585;NA;J INF TECHNOL EDUC-R;J.

Changes in the technological and social conditions of modern society need new professional skills, which are often called 21st century skills. These skills should be developed starting from the primary school, as they are psychological and behavioural, rather than practical. Game-based learning and gamification are effective means of such skills development. The use of video games in teaching practice is studied multifaceted, along with formats and requirements of educational game, methods for effectiveness assessment, and the effect of games on students. The controversial nature of game-based learning effect on students require deeper research, as the increase in motivation and learning efficiency cannot be disputed, as well as the negative impact of a long gaming on cognitive abilities, emotional state and social skills of students. The study tested both an increase in the motivation and attraction of school students for the learning process, and the impact on the practical results of information assimilation. There was conducted a survey on the results of the application of game training to determine the motivation and attraction of students. Likewise, we counted time, spent by the study and control group, for mastering the main educational material and the post-class study of game content and the educational material it presents. A comparative test was conducted on the results of educational material comprehension to determine the effectiveness of the methodology in mastering knowledge. The group, with game-based learning and gamification applied, showed an increase in motivation and attraction to learning, students paid additional efforts for assimilating the material studied, and also showed significantly higher learning outcomes compared to the control group.;"[Liu, Zi-Yu] GuangXi Normal Univ, Sch Foreign Language, Guilin, Peoples R China; [Shaikh, Zaffar Ahmed] Benazir Bhutto Shaheed Univ Lyari, Karachi, Pakistan; [Gazizova, Farida] Kazan Fed Univ, Elabuga Inst, Dept Theory & Methodol Presch & Primary Educ, Yelabuga, Russia";Liu, ZY (corresponding author), GuangXi Normal Univ, Sch Foreign Language, Guilin, Peoples R China.;51995812@qq.com;NA;NA;"Innovation Project of Guang Xi Graduate Education [JGY2018020, JGY2019031]; Project of Institute of Vietnam Studies, GuangXi Normal University [YN2017004]; Funding of Pearl River-Xijiang River Economic Belt Development Institute, Guangxi Normal University [ZX202008]";"The first author was supported by Innovation Project of Guang Xi Graduate Education (No. JGY2018020; JGY2019031); Project of Institute of Vietnam Studies, GuangXi Normal University (YN2017004); Funding of Pearl River-Xijiang River Economic Belt Development Institute, Guangxi Normal University (ZX202008).";NA;32;3;3;5;9;KASSEL UNIV PRESS GMBH;KASSEL;DIAGONALE 10, D-34127 KASSEL, GERMANY;1863-0383;NA;NA;INT J EMERG TECHNOL;Int.

Most of them are strongly related to either in-class or take-home assessment. This paper compares the impact of both assessments on student performance for one academic semester. The findings are expected to re-align the focus of educational technology and teaching intervention research. Fifty-five laboratory sessions were analyzed, involving five Introductory Programming classes with a total of 87 Information Technology and Information System undergraduates. The study shows that, by considering only significant changes, in-class assessment leads to higher assessment mark as the students can easily seek help and focus on the tasks.

The purpose of writing this article is to develop an appropriate gamification model in tertiary institutions which links gamification theory and problem- based learning into a new model that will later be combined with existing learn- ing media to become more effective and interesting when applied in each course. Research on learning design models can be classified into three types: model development, model validation, and model use. This study discuses two points above, which are based on research methodologies for model development and model validation where learning models are developed either practically or theoretically. In theory, the cause is based on the literature related to the model that is to be developed, being practical because it must be based on a learning design that is suitable for real life. The gamified problem-based learning design model has been based on literature and has projected real-life learning needs.

The computer-based interactive multimedia simulations of scenarios for diagnosis and treatment allow for the avoidance of the risk of improper actions in regard to a real life patient, to repeat the clinical situations an unlimited number of times, and to standardize the tasks and criteria of their completion. Virtual patients represent a factual basis of problem-based learning. This review article focuses on the use of this educational technology for the development of medical decision making skills internationally, on its pedagogical effectiveness, and on the variants of the linear and branching scenarios. Meta-analyses demonstrate the pedagogical effectiveness of virtual patients and an interest of the trainees. An integration of the virtual patients into the learning contributes to clinical training gamification, which inspires the students and medical doctors to engage in interactivity and teamwork. The creation of a repository or a web-service of multimedia virtual patients in the tradition of national clinical school is of great current interest for implementation in the system of higher and continuing medical education.;"[Karas, S., I] Russian Acad Sci, Tomsk Natl Res Med Ctr, Cardiol Res Inst, 111a Kievskaja Str, Tomsk 634012, Russia; [Karas, S., I] Siberian State Med Univ, 2 Moscow Trakt, Tomsk 634050, Russia";"Karas, SI (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Tomsk Natl Res Med Ctr, Cardiol Res Inst, 111a Kievskaja Str, Tomsk 634012, Russia.; Karas, SI (corresponding author), Siberian State Med Univ, 2 Moscow Trakt, Tomsk 634050, Russia.";ksi@cardio-tomsk.ru;NA;NA;Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [19-013-00231 A];The author expresses gratitude to the Russian Foundation for Basic Research for financial support of the work under the grant No. 19-013-00231 A Information and communication technologies for the formation and improvement of clinical and diagnostic competencies of students in the system of postgraduate medical education.;NA;57;1;2;0;0;SIBERIAN STATE MEDICAL UNIV;TOMSK;UL LENINA 107, TOMSK, 63405, RUSSIA;1682-0363;1819-3684;NA;BYULLETEN SIB MED;BYULLETEN SIB.

Gamification has the potential to be a new paradigm in enhancing online user engagement in the online based education system. As Mathematics subjects is normally associated with a high drop-out rate, especially among students who have encountered low mathematical performance in their past, the implementation of gamification may support more successful online learning for this subject. Three undergraduate classes with at least four months experience in using any gamified learning objects implemented using Kahoot!, Socrative or Quizizz were selected as a case study. This study aimed to examine the association between Situational Motivation with the dimensions of Online Learning Readiness using a mixed-methods-approach. 34 students voluntarily answered an online survey and a total of twelve participants were purposively selected to answer open-ended questions. The results showed that significant positive associations were found between students 'online learning readiness in three dimensions (technical competencies, social competencies with classmates, and social competencies with lecturers) with both identified and intrinsic motivation. No such association between students' online learning readiness dimensions and amotivation was found for students who participated. This finding can provide a better understanding of how situational motivation relates to students' online learning readiness among students using gamified learning objects.

The results show that the realistic game design and the contextualization of the game do have a notable influence. They are both examples of best practices in game design; second, to evaluate the learning effectiveness of the game. The results suggest a high correlation between playing the game and succeeding in the course. Moreover, chronological analysis of the performance reveals that the intention to play the game could be a simple dropout predictor. Thus, introducing the game in the educational curricula improves student engagement and consolidates their knowledge on cybersecurity.";"[Ros, S.; Gonzalez, S.; Robles, A.; Tobarra, Ll; Caminero, A.] Natl Distance Educ Univ UNED, Dept Commun & Control Syst, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Cano, Jesus] CEU San Pablo Univ, Fac Law, Madrid 28003, Spain";Ros, S (corresponding author), Natl Distance Educ Univ UNED, Dept Commun & Control Syst, Madrid 28040, Spain.;sros@scc.uned.es;"Cano, Jesus/K-6066-2018; Ros, Salvador/C-4829-2015";"Cano, Jesus/0000-0001-6926-1311; Ros, Salvador/0000-0001-6330-4958";"Spanish Distance University; Spanish Network of Learning Analytics, SNOLA; Spanish Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Universities [RED2018-102725-T]; G-Elios UNED Research Group; UNED";This work was supported in part by Spanish Distance University, UNED, Spanish Network of Learning Analytics, SNOLA, supported by Spanish Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Universities under Grant RED2018-102725-T, and in part by the G-Elios UNED Research Group.;NA;49;1;1;9;10;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;NA;NA;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;NA;2020;8;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;97718;97728;NA;10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2996361;NA;NA;11;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";LZ3HX;WOS:000541119900001;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Step 2 was employed to check the research hypotheses by a quasi-experiment interventional study design. To this end, data were gathered from two groups: research and control (which has not experienced the intervention), both groups were Education students. Participants' perceived DL skills and creative self-concept (CSC) were surveyed twice - before (pretest) and after (posttest) a three-month intervention. Lastly, qualitative data were collected and analyzed (Step 3) to better understand the quantitative data results. Results revealed significant differences between the pre/post tests only for the research group on the DL and CSC factors - the scores at the posttest were higher than the pretest. Non-significant differences were indicated between the tests for the control group. Results also indicated significant low to moderate connections between the DL and CSC factors.

Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional, cross-country survey study (n=319) was conducted recruiting participants from one North American and two British universities. The survey data and the conceptual model have been analysed and tested using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings Participants displayed positive attitudes towards the 3D game and responded positively to theory presented as real-life scenarios; gamification techniques such as interactions and dialogue, and rewards and progression levels, which are part of the game, albeit the participants' adoption was driven more by extrinsic motivations (rewards) than intrinsic ones (ease of use and entertainment). In addition, the empirical results suggest that when gender is taken into account, the perceptions and needs of cross-cultural learners in serious gaming environments vary and display characteristics that are similar to Rogers' five adopter categories; thus, culture could significantly shape learners' decisions to adopt a serious game as a managerial learning tool. Research limitations/implications For future researchers, this paper highlights various levels of training, support and promotional awareness that need to be considered to facilitate the adoption of serious games for managerial learning. Practical implications For academics and practitioners in work-based learning and managerial training environments, this paper highlights the salient factors that need to be inherent in a serious 3D game, and best practices for scaffolding existing instructional approaches or training interventions.

However, previous research has not attempted to empirically investigate the effects of game elements on the quality of motivation (i.e., intrinsic and extrinsic motivation). Thus, this study investigates in detail the relationship between gamification and motivation through the lens of self-determination theory and seeks to determine whether gamification can maintain student motivation for the duration of an entire semester. The experiment was conducted in the fall semesters of 2016 and 2017 with 122 students (63 in 2016, 59 in 2017). Overall, the results showed that (1) gamification can maintain student motivation over the course of the semester and (2) gamification positively affects intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, negatively affects amotivation, and may, therefore, positively affect academic performance.;"[Kim, Eunsik] Univ Windsor, Mech Automot & Mat Engn, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Rothrock, Ling] Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, 213 Leonhard Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Freivalds, Andris] Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, 216 Leonhard Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA";Kim, E (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Mech Automot & Mat Engn, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.;"eskim@uwindsor.ca; lxr28@psu.edu; axf@psu.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;64;0;0;0;6;TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS;DURRUS, BANTRY;IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND;0949-149X;NA;NA;INT J ENG EDUC;Int.

To capitalize on the promise of serious games in health care education, it is important for instructional designers to understand the underlying learners' values, attitudes, and beliefs that might motivate nongaming female health care preprofessional students to independently choose to persistently play serious games to mastery. Objective: Specifically, the aim of this study was to seek answers to 2 questions. First, what values, attitudes, and beliefs contribute to the nongaming behaviors of 12th-grade female emerging health care preprofessionals? Second, how do the values, attitudes, and beliefs of 12th-grade female emerging health care preprofessionals align with important design features of serious games? Methods: In this study, a learner analysis was conducted using semistructured interviews with 8 12th-grade college-bound female health science students to better understand learners' values, attitudes, and beliefs to inform the design and development of a serious game. These interviewees represented a diverse subset of the female emerging health care preprofessionals who self-identified themselves as not playing games at all, not very often, or infrequently. Results: The findings suggest that the study participants exhibited a complex fusion of desire for both accomplishment and affiliation. The participants were all independent, competitive, and prosocial leaders. They thought strategically and consciously self-limited their leisure time to achieve personally meaningful long-term goals. They embraced overcoming expected failures and aimed to achieve relevant high-stakes wins in all academic, athletic, extracurricular, and leisure activities they valued while consciously avoiding what they considered to be non-goal-oriented activities. Conclusions: The results of this study reinforce the need for a robust learner analysis to identify the multifaceted behavioral characteristics of targeted learners before the design and development of serious games. The common characteristics of the 12th-grade female health science students in this study suggest that they will choose to invest their limited leisure time playing a personally meaningful, preprofessionally authentic serious game if the collective design elements are aligned with the students' self-conceptualization of their present or future selves.;"[Glover, Kevin; Bodzin, Alec] Lehigh Univ, Coll Educ, Iacocca Hall,111 Res Dr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA";Glover, K (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Coll Educ, Iacocca Hall,111 Res Dr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.;krg205@lehigh.edu;NA;"Glover, Kevin/0000-0001-8521-0311; Bodzin, Alec/0000-0002-5045-1681";NA;NA;NA;60;2;2;0;1;JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC;TORONTO;130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA;2291-9279;NA;NA;JMIR SERIOUS GAMES;JMIR Serious Games;JAN-MAR;2020;8;1;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;e16003;10.2196/16003;NA;NA;13;"Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Medical Informatics";"Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Medical Informatics";KZ4XN;WOS:000523267400007;32027312;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Teachers are able to take the advantages of the integration of technology and assessment to get really detail information of students test to create a good teaching process. However, there are not many teachers, who really consider about assessment and the washback effect on students' learning. Thus, this study aimed to explore the washback effect of Quizizz assessment platform on students' learning.

This article arises from the need to stop, think, and reflect on current trends in Physical Education, which at times seem to be more an obstacle to its progress to the extent that they may even work against its true purpose and essence. Based on scientific evidence, five common practice aspects to reflect upon in our field have been proposed: (1) Misunderstood gamification; (2) indiscriminate use of APPs: (3) poorly focused cooperative learning; (4) true motivation; and (5) evidences of students' 'earnings. Different practical solutions based on the use of formative and shared evaluation and the cross-sectional use of the body were proposed.

The authors prove that one of the factors contributing to the effective development of the educational process in a modern higher education institution is the formation of prospective teachers' digital competence by means of gamification. The reason for that is the predominance of a new ideology based on gamification and digitalization of education, where traditional teachers are replaced by teachers-gamers, coordinators of online platforms and educational trajectories. It was found out that the result of prospective teachers digital training is formed digital competence, which consists of the following components: value-motivational, cognitive and operational ones. The research methods used to verify the formation of prospective teachers' digital competence by means of gamification according to certain criteria (motivational, cognitive, reflexive-corrective) have been described. The results of the conducted questionnaires, testing and interviews have given grounds to indicate the level of the prospective teachers' digital competence formation by means of gamification as mainly medium and low. On the basis of the obtained results, the technology of prospective teachers' digital competence formation by means of gamification has been developed and implemented at the following stages: professional-motivational stage, contentactivity, reflexive-correctional. The developed technology has been implemented under the following conditions: the integration of gaming tools into the process of prospective teachers training; the application of organizational and technical measures and methods of providing information security when working with digital educational technologies; the selection of the most effective digital educational technologies; the application of educational platforms for the development of digital learning projects. The following mobile applications aimed at prospective teachers' digital competence development have been used: DuoLingo, ClassDojo, Coursera, Brainscape, Socrative 101.

It has a serious impact on the child's personality, upbringing, education, socialization, development, and academic success from the preschool period to the university and beyond. In general, traditional teaching methods usually have a fixed learning structure which disables the child to be motivated, creative and innovative. Learners receive theoretical rather than practical instructions, which discourage them from keeping and recalling concepts and information more quickly. Moreover, traditional teaching usually lacks attracting the full attention of learners which decreases their interaction, engagement and investment in the content. Thus, the development of innovative approaches offering better education is an effective way to address this problem. On the other hand, recent researches in the fields of cognitive science and educational neuroscience show that play-based learning is a promising approach to use in early childhood education. Four key success factors for learning have been identified to strengthen children's skills, namely attention, active engagement, feedback, and consolidation. Thus, the proposed approach presents a digital play-based learning approach deploying serious games augmenting the pedagogical aspect of the Montessori approach. Our purpose is to improve children's skills in their early years education through play-based learning and gamification. It aims to provide children with a rich variety of serious gaming activities and challenging experiences in an interactive environment. We developed several serious games based on Montessori pedagogical principal and the four pillars of learning. For the evaluation, we have chosen a representative sample of children from rural regions.;"[Lamrani, Rachid; Abdelwahed, El Hassan] Cadi Ayyad Univ, Lab LISI, Marrakech 40000, Morocco; [Abdelwahed, El Hassan] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ, CSEHS, Benguerir 43150, Morocco";Lamrani, R (corresponding author), Cadi Ayyad Univ, Lab LISI, Marrakech 40000, Morocco.;"rachid.lamrani@ced.uca.ac.ma; abdelwahed@uca.ac.ma";NA;Abdelwahed, El Hassan/0000-0002-2786-6707;NA;NA;NA;49;1;1;6;22;COMSIS CONSORTIUM;NOVI SAD;UNIV NOVI SAD, FAC TECH SCI, TRG DOSITEJA OBRADOVICA 6, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA;1820-0214;NA;NA;COMPUT SCI INF SYST;Comput.

This research was made with the participation of 35 students through the application of a semi-structured questionnaire with 20 questions using a 5 point linkert scale, varying from totally disagree to totally agree and an open question. To analyze the questions an Individual Medium Ranking (RM) was created and then was calculated the arithmetic media among the RM of three different categories. The results have shown that the proposed activity had positive effect upon student engagement, stimulating their autonomy toward their own learning process.

The benefits of tourist destinations in Indonesia finally form three patterns, namely natural, cultural, and human-made. City and village tourism are very popular with the community because of the high interest of the community to capture the moments of Instagram able and viral tourism spots. One of them is village tourism. For people who are educated with life in the village, it is necessary to make it more interesting with gamification. In this study, the aim was to change the pattern of visitors' activities, which initially only took pictures but were also invited to explore the village potential through a mobile application. Also, this study is used to improve and help preserve and introduce village tourism potential. Gamification can be an alternative to developing village tourism potential. A common occurrence in tourist villages is a lack of management innovation to add village tourism potential to visitors further. So, we design mobile village tourism for village education. This activity is an education that contains planting plants. The results of this application are of rice planting and fruit picking games. Each set consists of two levels. Level 1 includes educational games and level 2 games about team cohesiveness. Each game will offer a reward. The rewards that we design are based on prizes that are liked by elementary school students.;"[Bahtiar, Arief Rais; Segara, Alon Jala Tirta; Suyoto] Univ Atma Jaya Yogyakarta, Dept Informat Engn, Yogyakarta, Indonesia";Suyoto (corresponding author), Univ Atma Jaya Yogyakarta, Dept Informat Engn, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.;suyoto@uajy.ac.id;Suyoto, Suyoto/F-2131-2019;"Suyoto, Suyoto/0000-0002-0446-1897; Bahtiar, Arief Rais/0000-0003-2903-0150";NA;NA;NA;23;0;0;4;10;KASSEL UNIV PRESS GMBH;KASSEL;DIAGONALE 10, D-34127 KASSEL, GERMANY;2192-4880;NA;NA;INT J ENG PEDAGOG;Int.

One method of learning for children is by playing while learning. Gamification in the field of education is an educational approach to motivate students to enjoy learning by applying the game design. The purpose of this study is to approach the learning of English, specifically for children in kindergarten schools so that children will be more interested and feel happy to continue learning. The gamification method uses a mobile phone-based application with video games. Gamification in question is an English language recognition game for children with games. The introduction of English includes three categories, namely numbers, pictures, and spelling. The result is a mobile-based application that can be used by children to play the introduction of English with the concept of gamification. With gamification, children become more interested and motivated to learn English. Display made it easier to understand and visually appealing. The contribution given through this paper is to motivate children's willingness to learn English through other learning methods, namely gamification.

Game-based learning environments are designed to teach specific knowledge content and skill-based learning outcomes using game elements. One main reason for using game-based learning environments is to increase student motivation and engagement while teaching learning outcomes. Many of the game-based learning environments are designed so that students will reach maximum flow, which is defined as students being so completely immersed in that game that they do not notice that they are learning. These learning environments have been shown to improve many behaviour and cognitive learning outcomes. While game-based learning has many benefits, some educational researchers have indicated that it is often very costly to develop a complex game-based assessment to teach a few learning outcomes. Hence, in some cases it is more beneficial to approach the use of computer games in education using gamification.;"[Chu, Man-Wai; Fowler, Teresa Anne] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada";Chu, MW (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.;NA;NA;Fowler, Teresa/0000-0002-2918-3061;NA;NA;NA;47;1;1;6;22;IGI GLOBAL;HERSHEY;701 E CHOCOLATE AVE, STE 200, HERSHEY, PA 17033-1240 USA;2155-6849;2155-6857;NA;INT J GAME-BASED LEA;Int.

This paper seeks to contribute to solving this shortcoming by connecting the application of the educational gamification carried out in the Distance Public Accounting Program of the Universidad Militar Nueva Granada (Colombia) with the theoretical foundations of the subject. To this end, researchers addressed the differences between gamification and game-based learning, examined the concept, objectives, contributions, and elements of the gamification, and identified the key aspects for a successful implementation in the educational context. Finally, they explained the process of gamification implemented from the teacher planning to the analysis of student opinions. For this, the methodology used was an exploratory one supported in documentary analysis and application of surveys to students. As a result of the application, researchers verified that educational gamification promotes autonomy, motivation, commitment, and social interaction in the students, allowing the progression and mastery of the issues covered in each proposed challenge.;"[Gomez Contreras, Jennifer Lorena] Univ Mil Nueva Granada, Programa Contaduria Publ Distancia, Bogota, Colombia; [Gomez Contreras, Jennifer Lorena] Grp Invest INCONDIS, Bogota, Colombia";"Contreras, JLG (corresponding author), Univ Mil Nueva Granada, Programa Contaduria Publ Distancia, Bogota, Colombia.; Contreras, JLG (corresponding author), Grp Invest INCONDIS, Bogota, Colombia.";jennifer.gomez@unimilitar.edu.co;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;76;0;0;1;3;UNIV ROSARIO, EDITORIAL;BOGOTA;CARRETERA 7, N 13-41, OFICINA 501, BOGOTA, 00000, COLOMBIA;0124-4639;2145-4558;NA;REV UNIV EMPRES;Rev.

However, theoretical underpinnings of the proposed effects of gamification are lacking. This paper applies the theory of gamified learning and extends research exploring the benefits of gamification on student learning through the testing effect. In a quasi-experimental design, university students (N = 473) prepared for three tests using traditional quizzes (i.e., a question, four response options) or gamified online quizzes (i.e., a wager option, a progress bar, encouraging messages). We assumed that students completing gamified quizzes would complete more quizzes and, through the benefits of the testing effect, would demonstrate better learning. Findings supported the testing effect in that students who completed more quizzes performed better on subsequent tests. Furthermore, students who completed the gamified quizzes had significantly better scores on the first test. However, this effect was not due to students completing more quizzes in the gamification group. Additionally, the beneficial effect of gamification did not persist for subsequent tests. This supports that gamification might work through a novelty effect where its influence may not be sustainable. Further analyses showed that higher achieving students benefited more from gamification than lower achieving students. Overall, the results (a) imply that gamification may be a viable option for short-term assignments, (b) highlight concerns of a novelty effect possibly recommending instructors not to use the same gamification method permanently, and (c) indicate that there are contexts where gamification might not be adequate to target low achieving students. Given these results we call for longitudinal studies investigating the novelty effects of gamification and research examining individual differences moderating the effects of gamification.;"[Sanchez, Diana R.; Kaur, Rupinder] San Francisco State Univ, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Langer, Markus] Saarland Univ, Saarbrucken, Germany";Sanchez, DR (corresponding author), San Francisco State Univ, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.;SanchezDianaR@sfsu.edu;"Langer, Markus/AAI-9135-2020; Sanchez, Diana R./AAH-1603-2020";"Langer, Markus/0000-0002-8165-1803; Sanchez, Diana R./0000-0003-4937-9114";NA;NA;NA;92;13;14;20;95;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;NA;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

A Teaching Innovation Project (TIP) seeks to provide a solution to the problems raised with new methods of teaching inside and outside the classroom and greater interaction between the students and the professor. This way, geometry is no longer something abstract, unrelated to the professional practice of the architect. Thereby, it is intended to structure a new subject that provides students not only with graphic and spatial techniques but also with teamwork, cooperation, training, sufficiency and autonomy resources that help them in the development of their future career. In order to carry out this new methodology for teaching, a course based on gamification has been designed, which allows the students to focus on the subject from a more playful point of view with the aim of motivating and involving them. Based on a three-year experience of comparative work between the traditional and the proposed systems, the conclusions obtained with regards to the withdrawal rate, academic performance and perception of the teaching method are presented in this paper. The incorporation of techniques based on games had a motivating effect on the students, who discovered a way of learning by playing what they previously perceived as a tedious subject.;"[Alvaro-Tordesillas, Antonio; Alonso-Rodriguez, Marta; Poza-Casado, Irene; Galvan-Desvaux, Noelia] Univ Valladolid, ETS Arquitectura, Avda Salamanca 18, Valladolid 47014, Spain";Alvaro-Tordesillas, A (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, ETS Arquitectura, Avda Salamanca 18, Valladolid 47014, Spain.;"tordesillas@arq.uva.es; marta.alonso.rodriguez@uva.es; irene.poza@uva.es; noeliagalvan@arq.uva.es";"Alvaro-Tordesillas, Antonio/M-9868-2015; Galvan Desvaux, Noelia/D-7488-2016; Poza-Casado, Irene/D-2061-2016";"Alvaro-Tordesillas, Antonio/0000-0002-9484-9966; Galvan Desvaux, Noelia/0000-0001-9421-5851; Poza-Casado, Irene/0000-0002-6692-5917";NA;NA;NA;46;6;6;4;35;UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA;MADRID;PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN;1139-613X;2174-5374;NA;EDUC XX1;Educ.

There has not been any recent effort to synthesize or critically analyse the systematic reviews in the area of educational technology. This study analysed 73 systematic literature reviews, including meta-analyses, focused on the evaluation of technology in educational contexts, in order to holistically understand the impact of learning technology use across different aspects of evaluation. Among these reviews, the most common theme examined was learning outcomes (89%), followed by affective elements (45%), behaviours (25%), technological elements (21%) and teaching/pedagogical aspects (19%). Most of the reviews found that the use of technology improved learning outcomes and affective perceptions. Approaches involving interaction, gamification, constructivism, student-centred learning and feedback were most effective. The analysis highlighted the need for more reviews focusing on multiple aspects of learning technology evaluation, on school level education and on the use of technology in naturalistic (non-interventional) settings. Critical reflections are also cast on the methods used to conduct systematic reviews in the educational technology field.;"[Lai, Jennifer W.

Serious games play an important role as tools for gamification, in particular in the context of software engineering courses because of the idiosyncratic nature of the topic. However, the studies on the improvement of student performance resulting from the use of gamification and serious games in courses with different contexts are not conclusive. More empirical research is thus needed to obtain reliable results on the effectiveness, benefits and drawbacks. The overall objective of this work is to study the benefits generated by serious games in the teaching-learning process of Computer Engineering degrees, analyzing the impact on the motivation and student satisfaction, as well as on the learning outcomes and results finally achieved. To this end, an intervention is proposed in the subject of Computer Architecture based on two components covering theoretical and practical sessions. In the theoretical sessions, a serious game experience using Kahoot has been introduced, complementing the master classes and class exercises. For the practical sessions, the development of projects with groups of students has been proposed, whose results in terms of computer performance can be compared through a competition (hackathon). Evaluation of the serious game-based intervention has been approached in terms of student satisfaction and motivation, as well as improved academic performance. In order to assess student satisfaction, surveys have been used to assess the effect on student motivation and satisfaction. For the evaluation of academic performance, a comparative analysis between an experimental and a control group has been carried out, noting a slight increase in the experimental group students' marks.;"[Fuster-Guillo, Andres; Jimeno-Morenilla, Antonio; Azorin-Lopez, Jorge; Rico Soliveres, Maria Luisa] Univ Alicante, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Alicante, Spain; [Luisa Pertegal-Felices, Maria] Univ Alicante, Dept Dev Psychol & Teaching, Alicante, Spain; [Restrepo-Calle, Felipe] Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Syst & Ind Engn, Bogota, Colombia";Pertegal-Felices, ML (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Dev Psychol & Teaching, Alicante, Spain.;ml.pertegal@ua.es;"Jimeno-Morenilla, Antonio/K-5544-2014; Soliveres, Maria Luisa Rico/Z-5012-2019; Fuster-Guillo, Andres/G-9707-2016";"Jimeno-Morenilla, Antonio/0000-0002-3789-6475; Soliveres, Maria Luisa Rico/0000-0002-2834-0352; Fuster-Guillo, Andres/0000-0003-0938-6344";NA;NA;NA;23;6;6;6;18;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;1664-1078;NA;NA;FRONT PSYCHOL;Front.

To fill this research gap, concept mapping was used to cluster teachers' beliefs in 4 dimensions regarding the use of gamification to develop students' competencies. Our findings suggest that teachers believe that gamification encourages team working and oral communication skills. Moreover, critical thinking and social skills development were also found as some of the benefits that teachers believe the use of gamification can provide to the development of students' competencies.

This scenario game set a good example to integrate components of e-Learning, gamification and scenario-based platform in tourism geography and planning education. This study evaluated the effectiveness of urban tourism scenario game in terms of knowledge enrichment, attitudinal change and platform usability reported by a sample of voluntary university students (n=30). The overall effectiveness of the game is found generally positive. Paired-sampled t-test results show that this game platform is successful in improving participants' fundamental knowledge about new concepts, models and issues in the urban tourism context.The nature of tourism study in social science involves dynamism of perception and views, and thus leading to attitudinal changes of the game players although these changes are only statistically significant in one-fourth of the attitudinal attributes. The usability is the shortcomings of the game since this dimension is difficult to control except some technical elements. From the statistical results, the game does not reach a high expectation of usability except the educational design of the game. Some discussions and suggestions are made to enhance the effectiveness of game-based learning in tourism education through clever integration of modes of learning and other e-Learning elements.;"[Chan, Chung-Shing; Chan, Yat-hang] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Fong, Tsz Heung Agnes] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Learning Enhancement & Res, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China";Chan, CS (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;ccs_johnson@cuhk.edu.hk;Chan, Chung Shing/W-4838-2018;Chan, Chung Shing/0000-0002-3847-3781;Teaching Development and Language Enhancement Grant (TDLEG) for 2016-19 Triennium of The Chinese University of Hong Kong;The research is supported by the Teaching Development and Language Enhancement Grant (TDLEG) for 2016-19 Triennium) of The Chinese University of Hong Kong.;NA;56;1;1;1;18;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1038-2046;1747-7611;NA;INT RES GEOGR ENVIRO;Int.

We applied a two-tiered motivational, online gamified learning system over 2 years to a total number of 333 students. In a mixed methods research design, we used 3-year worth of longitudinal data (333 students for the treatment group and 175 in the control group) to assess students' engagement and performance in that period. Quantitative results established that students engaged and performed better in the gamified condition vis-a-vis the nongamified. Furthermore, students exhibited higher levels of engagement in the second year compared with the first year of the gamified condition. Our qualitative data suggest that students in the second year of the gamified delivery exhibited sustained engagement, overcoming the novelty effect. Thus, our main contribution is in suggesting ways of making the engagement meaningful and useful for the students, thus sustaining their engagement with computer-based gamified learning systems and overcoming the novelty effect.;"[Tsay, Crystal Han-Huei; Yang, Yang] Univ Greenwich, Human Resources & Org Behav, Greenwich Learning & Teaching, London, England; [Kofinas, Alexander K.] Univ Bedfordshire, Dept Strategy & Management, Luton, Beds, England; [Trivedi, Smita Kishor] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Management, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA";Tsay, CHH (corresponding author), Univ Greenwich, Dept Human Resources & Org Behav, 30 Pk Row, London SE10 9LS, England.;h.tsay@greenwich.ac.uk;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;75;9;9;3;26;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0266-4909;1365-2729;NA;J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR;J.

Therefore, while coming to traditional classrooms, it is required to call for different forms of teaching that are more motivating and engaging for them. One approach to this problem is combining games and education. Gamification could be defined as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts. The research gap in the literature could be found in requiring more experimental studies assessing if gamification can improve learning outcomes. To this end, this paper further contributes to determining if a gamified social e-learning platform can improve the learning performance and engagement of MSc students. The developed platform combined submission of activities with points, achievements, leaderboards, and rewards (with a virtual store) and social elements such as friends, forums, Q&A, blogs, and microblogging. Results show that, indeed, social gamification is a suitable technique to improve the learning outcome of students, at least for those skills related to programming, providing more communication skills and producing more engagement and motivation while using the platform.;"[Garcia-Cabot, Antonio; Garcia-Lopez, Eva; Caro-Alvaro, Sergio; Gutierrez-Martinez, Jose-Maria; de-Marcos, Luis] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Comp Sci, Madrid 28805, Spain";Garcia-Cabot, A (corresponding author), Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Comp Sci, Madrid 28805, Spain.;a.garciac@uah.es;"Caro-Alvaro, Sergio/U-8991-2018; de Marcos, Luis/D-8990-2012; Gutierrez-Martinez, Jose-Maria/I-3876-2015";"Caro-Alvaro, Sergio/0000-0002-3192-8499; de Marcos, Luis/0000-0003-0718-8774; Garcia-Cabot, Antonio/0000-0002-0298-3237; Gutierrez-Martinez, Jose-Maria/0000-0003-0134-1256";Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [TIN2014-54874-R];Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Grant/Award Number: TIN2014-54874-R;NA;61;4;4;5;18;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;NA;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

Multiple researchers have introduced nontraditional teaching methods, but there is no scientific consensus on the best nontraditional teaching methods that are tailored to learners' abilities while most effectively addressing the course objectives. Therefore, the goal of this review was to address the following questions across all engineering disciplines, based on learners' abilities and the course objectives: (a) What are the benefits of nontraditional teaching methods? and (b) How would you categorize the benefits of nontraditional teaching methods? A qualitative review was conducted to achieve these goals, and the initial search for papers, using relevant keywords, resulted in more than 2000 peer-reviewed articles that were published between 2000 and 2017. A total of 125 peer-reviewed articles pertaining to the most frequently studied nontraditional teaching methods were comprehensively studied and analyzed. The analysis resulted in practical guidelines, including a list of the benefits of the five studied nontraditional teaching methods (flipped classroom, gamification, case study, self-learning, and social media) belonging to four categories: technical/professional, personal skills/ability, personal attitude, and time and space. Based on the results, the authors established significant guidelines for instructors who aim to optimize learners' achievements by adopting the most effective teaching styles, based on their course objectives and the learners' abilities.;"[Safapour, Elnaz; Kermanshachi, Sharareh; Taneja, Piyush] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Civil Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA";Kermanshachi, S (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Civil Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.;"elnaz.safapour@mavs.uta.edu; sharareh.kermanshachi@uta.edu; piyush.taneja@mavs.uta.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;135;5;6;6;15;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2227-7102;NA;EDUC SCI;Educ.

Many studies show improvements with respect to traditional methodologies. Several educational strategies have also been combined with Gamification with interesting results. Interest is growing and evidence suggest Gamification has a promising future. However, there is a barrier preventing many researchers from properly understanding Gamification principles. Gamification focuses of engaging trainees in learning with same intensity that games engage players on playing. But only some very well designed games achieve this level of engagement. Designing truly entertaining games is a difficult task with a great artistic component. Although some studies have tried to clarify how Game Design produces fun, there is no scientific consensus. Well established knowledge on Game Design resides in sets of rules of thumb and good practices, based on empirical experience. Game industry professionals acquire this experience through practice. Most educators and researchers often overlook the need for such experience to successfully design Gamification. And so, many research papers focus on single game-elements like points, present non-gaming activities like questionnaires, design non-engaging activities or fail to comprehend the underlying principles on why their designs do not yield expected results. This work presents a rubric for educators and researchers to start working in Gamification without previous experience in Game Design. This rubric decomposes the continuous space of Game Design into a set of ten discrete characteristics. It is aimed at diminishing the entry barrier and helping to acquire initial experience with Game Design fundamentals. The main proposed uses are twofold: to analyse existing games or gamified activities gaining a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses and to help in the design or improvement of activities. Focus is on Game Design characteristics rather than game elements, similarly to professional game designers. The goal is to help gaining experience towards designing successful Gamification environments. Presented rubric is based on our previous design experience, compared and contrasted with literature, and empirically tested with some example games and gamified activities.;"[Gallego-Duran, Francisco J.; Villagra-Arnedo, Carlos J.; Satorre-Cuerda, Rosana; Compan-Rosique, Patricia; Molina-Carmona, Rafael; Llorens-Largo, Faraon] Univ Alicante, Catedra Santander, UA Transformac Digital, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Spain";Gallego-Duran, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Catedra Santander, UA Transformac Digital, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Spain.;"fjgallego@ua.es; villagra@ua.es; rosana.satorre@ua.es; patricia.company@ua.es; rmolina@ua.es; Faraon.Llorens@ua.es";"Gallego-Duran, Francisco J./AAE-3854-2019; Compan, Patricia/K-5758-2014; Largo, Faraon Llorens/K-5060-2014; ARNEDO, CARLOS JOSE VILLAGRA/P-6022-2019; Rafael, Molina Carmona/K-6372-2014";"Gallego-Duran, Francisco J./0000-0002-6711-8666; Compan, Patricia/0000-0001-9281-2759; Largo, Faraon Llorens/0000-0002-2117-0784; ARNEDO, CARLOS JOSE VILLAGRA/0000-0002-2619-2632; Rafael, Molina Carmona/0000-0001-5168-4500";NA;NA;NA;42;5;5;0;5;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2227-9709;NA;INFORMATICS-BASEL;Informatics-Basel;DEC;2019;6;4;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;49;10.3390/informatics6040049;NA;NA;19;Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications;Computer Science;KA4KV;WOS:000505766600003;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Paired sampling was used with a total number of 60 students in an urban high school setting. Students in the experimental group used Speed Mandarin throughout a 16-week academic semester. Pre- and post-treatment questionnaires were used to examine students' beliefs about their abilities to read Chinese, understand spoken Chinese, speak Chinese, acquire new Chinese vocabulary, and use a variety of learning strategies to master Chinese. Data were also gathered about their level of motivation to learn Chinese. Data analysis via one-way ANOVA with the experimental condition as the between-group measure showed significance for the effect of Speed Mandarin on students' belief in their ability to speak Chinese, but showed no significant effects on reading, listening, or vocabulary acquisition. Nor was there any significant difference in language learning strategies or motivation for learning Chinese. Suggestions are provided for potential use of Speed Mandarin in high school Chinese classes as well as for further research. Further research is needed in order to investigate possible relationships between the use of Speed Mandarin and increases in student confidence in other areas of language learning, as well as increases in actual student performance.;"[Wang, Chen Lih-Ching; Liu Xiongyi] Cleveland State Univ, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA; [Zhang Qianwei] Baton Rouge Int Sch, Baton Rouge, LA USA";Wang, C (corresponding author), Cleveland State Univ, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.;"l.c.wang@csuohio.edu; x.liu6@csuohio.edu; zhangqianwei228@qq.com";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;16;0;0;7;15;JOURNAL TECHNOLOGY & CHINESE LANGUAGE TEACHING;CLINTON;198 COLLEGE HILL RD, CLINTON, NY 13323 USA;1949-260X;NA;NA;J TECHNOL CHIN LANG;J.

Gamification is defined as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts. When applying gamification, we make various game rules, such as a time limit. However, it is not clear whether the rule affects working time or not. For example, if we apply a time limit to impatient developers, the working time may become shorter, but the rule may negatively affect because of pressure for time. In this study, we analyze with subjective experiments whether the rules affects work results such as working time.

Many complications can arise if diabetes is poorly managed. Hence, the need for adequate knowledge, skills, and ability to care for oneself, known as diabetes self-care management, is needed to reduce complication rates. We used an interactive platform that incorporates principles of gamification to enhance user engagement to enhance diabetes knowledge. The purpose of this descriptive pilot study was to discover what adult patients with diabetes thought about this novel educational approach to diabetes education. Materials and Methods: We collected focus group data from participants at a diabetes clinic after they played an interactive diabetes trivia game, on our software platform (Kaizen Education). Transcripts were coded and common themes were identified. Results: We conducted 9 focus groups that included 33 adult (age >18) participants who had diabetes. An overarching theme of play/gaming as a form of learning was apparent, and after analyzing the coding several themes emerged, including preferences and desired environments (clinic and home) for learning, desired players (including family, significant others), and a good balance of question difficulty. Conclusions: Participants were overwhelmingly positive about gamified education and felt empowered to lead discussions with their health care providers about diabetes self-care education, in a sense flipping the traditional clinic patient education paradigm. These results suggested that a flipped clinic approach could be beneficial, empowering, and engaging for patients.;"[Talley, Michele H.; Ogle, Nicole; Wingo, Nancy; Roche, Cathy] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Sch Nursing, Birmingham, AL USA; [Willig, James] UAB Sch Med, Birmingham, AL USA";Talley, MH (corresponding author), UAB Sch Nursing, 1701 Univ Blvd,NB 454, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.;talleym@uab.edu;Wingo, Nancy/AAZ-3066-2020;Wingo, Nancy/0000-0002-1038-3274;"intramural UAB School of Nursing Dean's Scholar Award; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR001417]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [P30DK079626] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";This study was supported by an intramural UAB School of Nursing Dean's Scholar Award.

Digital badges (hereafter badges) provide two potential supports for learning: (1) badges provide support for motivation by rewarding achievement and (2) badges provide implicit learning goals. The present paper describes two experiments in which we investigated whether badges can support self-regulated learning by comparing their impact on learning with students given explicit goals for student learning, a key factor in self-regulated learning. Specifically, we compared the effects of badges and goal setting in a low-stakes learning context (Experiment 1; online extra credit unit) and a high-stakes learning context (Experiment 2; introductory Educational Psychology courses). In these two quasi-experiments, participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: badge only, goal only, badge + goal, or control (i.e., no badge, no goal). Learning was measured by comparing performance on topics related to Turkish Culture (Experiment 1) or Educational Psychology (Experiment 2) at pre-test and post-test. Somewhat surprisingly, the results from both studies demonstrated no significant improvement in learning between groups. The discussion suggests that caution should be taken when incorporating badges in learning contexts and provides guidance on the conditions under which badges may be most effective for supporting learning.";"[Morris, Bradley J.; Dragovich, Colleen; Todaro, Rachael; Balci, Sebiha; Dalton, Eve] Kent State Univ, Dept Educ Psychol, POB 5190, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Morris, Bradley J.] Kent State Univ, Dept Lifespan Dev & Educ Sci, 405 White Hall, Kent, OH 44242 USA";"Morris, BJ (corresponding author), Kent State Univ, Dept Educ Psychol, POB 5190, Kent, OH 44242 USA.; Morris, BJ (corresponding author), Kent State Univ, Dept Lifespan Dev & Educ Sci, 405 White Hall, Kent, OH 44242 USA.";bmorri20@kent.edu;NA;Balci, Sebiha/0000-0002-4004-7757;NA;NA;NA;66;2;2;8;30;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1042-1726;1867-1233;NA;J COMPUT HIGH EDUC;J.

In the context of VR/AR educational experiences, significant transformations are needed; in particular, these experiences move away from local teaching to translocal teaching as the virtual world gives students the possibility to disconnect from their physical environment.

These systems can deliver high-level multisensory learning experiences that are important in the teaching of many subjects, especially those involving abstract concepts or requiring spatial skills, such as organic chemistry. Haptic experiences with VR, however, remain a challenge. In addition, development has focused on general entertainment/gaming; VR systems in chemistry implement simulations of the chemistry laboratory and other advanced systems whereas those that support safe, game-like, immersive and multisensory learning of organic chemistry with haptics at pre-university education levels are scarce. We developed the VR Multisensory Classroom (VRMC) as an immersive learning environment within a VR head-mounted display, where learners employ hand movements to build hydrocarbon molecules and experience haptic feedback through gloves with built-in sensors and hand-tracking with the Leap Motion system. We report here the evaluation of the first prototype by learners from diverse backgrounds who reported on the ability of the VRMC to support high engagement, motivation, interest and organic chemistry learning as well as diverse learning styles.

The use of reward-based gamiflcation strategies is one approach to promote student engagement and prevent dropout. However, there is a lack of solid empirical studies analyzing the effects of rewards in MOOC environments. This paper reports a between-subjects design study conducted in a MOOC to analyze the effects of badges and redeemable rewards on student retention and engagement. Results show that the implemented reward strategies had not significant effect on student retention and behavioral engagement measured through the number of page views, task submissions, and student activity time. However, it was found that learners able to earn badges and redeemable rewards participated more in gamified tasks than those learners in the control group. Additionally, results reveal that the participants in the redeemable reward condition requested and earned earlier the rewards than those participants in the badge condition. The potential implications of these findings in the instructional design of future gamified MOOCs are also discussed.;"[Ortega-Arranz, Alejandro; Bote-Lorenzo, Miguel L.; Asensio-Perez, Juan I.; Gomez-Sanchez, Eduardo; Dimitriadis, Yannis] Univ Valladolid, Sch Telecommun Engn, P de Belen 15, Valladolid 47011, Spain; [Martinez-Mones, Alejandra] Univ Valladolid, Sch Comp Engn, P de Belen 15, Valladolid 47011, Spain";Ortega-Arranz, A (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Sch Telecommun Engn, P de Belen 15, Valladolid 47011, Spain.;"alex@gsic.uva.es; migbot@tel.uva.es; juaase@tel.uva.es; amartine@infor.uva.es; edugom@tel.uva.es; yannis@tel.uva.es";"Martinez-Mones, Alejandra/K-7810-2014; Dimitriadis, Yannis/K-6846-2014; Bote-Lorenzo, Miguel L./D-5925-2012; Asensio-Perez, Juan I./E-7285-2011";"Martinez-Mones, Alejandra/0000-0003-3201-0345; Dimitriadis, Yannis/0000-0001-7275-2242; Bote-Lorenzo, Miguel L./0000-0002-8825-0412; Asensio-Perez, Juan I./0000-0002-1114-2819";"European Regional Development FundEuropean Commission; National Research Agency of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [TIN2017-85179-C3-2-R, TIN2014-53199-C3-2-R]; Regional Ministry of Education of Castilla y Leon [VA257P18]; European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [588438-EPP-1-2017-1-EL-EPPKA2-KA]";"This research has been partially funded by the European Regional Development Fund and the National Research Agency of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities under project grants TIN2017-85179-C3-2-R and TIN2014-53199-C3-2-R; by the European Regional Development Fund and the Regional Ministry of Education of Castilla y Leon under project grant VA257P18; and by the European Commission under project grant 588438-EPP-1-2017-1-EL-EPPKA2-KA.

We address these gaps by conducting a theory-grounded design, development, and evaluation of a gamified e-training system for technology learning. Called GAMESIT, this e-training system has an added gamification layer. Drawing upon Malone's theory of intrinsically motivating instruction, we choose and design gamification elements (e.g., levels, avatar evolution, and distinct visuals) to create appropriate motivational drivers, namely, challenge, curiosity, and fantasy, for learning tasks. We follow a design science framework to iteratively develop GAMESIT and evaluate its effectiveness. In a laboratory experiment, participants using GAMESIT, when compared to those using the non-gamified e-training system, showed improvement in learning outcomes, measured as learners' knowledge comprehension and task performance, and higher engagement, captured through learners' cognitive effort.;"[Park, Juneyoung; Yi, Mun Y.] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Daejeon, South Korea; [Liu, De] Univ Minnesota, Informat & Decis Sci Dept, Carbon Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Santhanam, Radhika] Univ Oklahoma, Price Coll Business, MIS Div, Norman, OK 73019 USA";Liu, D (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Informat & Decis Sci Dept, Carbon Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;"j.park89@kaist.ac.kr; deliu@umn.edu; munyi@kaist.ac.kr; Radhika@ou.edu";NA;Liu, De/0000-0002-9430-9732;NA;NA;NA;69;6;7;5;63;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;NA;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

To meet this need, the objectives of this study were: to design a competition-based game in the virtual world, Second Life and to analyze the students' perceptions of Second Life and the game, as well as to analyze the medium-term retention of knowledge and the potential impact on the final grades. Ninety out of 197 (45.6%) third-year medical students voluntarily participated in an online game based on self-guided presentations and multiple-choice tests over six 6-day stages. Participants and non-participants were invited to perform an evaluation questionnaire about the experience and a post-exposure knowledge test. Participants rated the experience with mean scores equal to or higher than 8.1 on a 10-point scale, highlighting the professor (9.5 +/- 1.1; mean +/- SD) and the virtual environment (8.9 +/- 1.1). Participants had better results in the post-exposure test than non-participants (59.0 +/- 13.5 versus 45.3 +/- 11.5; P < 0.001) and a lower percentage of answers left blank (6.7 +/- 8.4 versus 13.1 +/- 12.9; P = 0.014). Competitive game-based learning within Second Life is an effective and well-accepted means of teaching core radiological anatomy and radiological signs content to medical students.

At the same time, the complex interplay of attack techniques and possible countermeasures makes it difficult to appropriately plan, implement, and evaluate an organization's defense. More often than not, the worlds of technical threats and organizational controls remain disjunct. In this article, we introduce PenQuest, a meta model designed to present a complete view on information system attacks and their mitigation while providing a tool for both semantic data enrichment and security education. PenQuest simulates time-enabled attacker/defender behavior as part of a dynamic, imperfect information multi-player game that derives significant parts of its ruleset from established information security sources such as STIX, CAPEC, CVE/CWE and NIST SP 800-53. Attack patterns, vulnerabilities, and mitigating controls are mapped to counterpart strategies and concrete actions through practical, data-centric mechanisms.

The purpose of this paper is to determine its potential in libraries to meet the needs of both users and librarians. The specific goals include: description of the main features of wearable computing from the perspective of its potential usefulness in libraries; analysis of areas of wearable computing use in public institutions; discussion of the potential of wearable computing for library users; and discussion of the potential of wearable computing for librarians to determine its potential in libraries to meet the needs of users and librarians. Design/methodology/approach The method of subject literature overview was used. The state of research from the period 2008 to 2018 on the use of wearable computing in libraries was established based on a search of selected sources Web of Science, Scopus, Elsevier and Emerald databases and LISTA database. Findings Wearable computing can be used in many areas of library activities to serve the needs of users and librarians. In the context of services for users, wearable computing can be used, among others, to help users navigate the library, to provide resources in new and interesting forms, and in education and entertainment. For the needs of librarians, additional data provided via wearable devices can accelerate the process of cataloguing resources and increase motivation to work via gamification options and features that make it possible to measure personal work efficiency. Librarians can also use the data obtained wearable computing devices to more quickly track, identify, select and organize resources. As with users, librarians can also use wearable computing in their education. Research limitations/implications - The paper is a viewpoint based on subject literature. It presents only a sketch of potential wearable computing applications in libraries. The aim of the paper is to initiate further discussion on the possibilities of using wearable devices to improve both services for users and internal library processes. The author's hope is that the concepts presented here will be tested in practice by librarians, which will allow further development of research on this subject. Practical implications - The results can be widely used in practice as a framework for the implementation of wearable computing solutions in libraries. Social implications The paper can help to facilitate the debate on the role of the implementation of new technologies in libraries. Originality/value The issue of the use of wearable computing has not yet been widely discussed in library and information science journals. In the very few publications on similar topics, only the perspective on the application of new solutions in services for users is presented. This paper also shows the potential for improving libraries' internal processes with the use of wearable computing.";[Wojcik, Magdalena] Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Management & Social Commun, Inst Informat Studies, Krakow, Poland;Wojcik, M (corresponding author), Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Management & Social Commun, Inst Informat Studies, Krakow, Poland.;magda.wojcik@uj.edu.pl;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;25;1;1;0;15;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;0737-8831;NA;NA;LIBR HI TECH;Libr.

This instructional approach is appealing because it can free up class time for knowledge application activities with help from the instructor and peers. However, its implementation can be fraught with challenges. Student disengagement in out-of-class activities, for example, is one of the major challenges of flipped learning. The purpose of this study is to examine whether gamification can enhance student engagement in a flipped course. A comparison study was conducted, involving two classes of undergraduate students in an Information Management course. The results indicated that students in the gamification-enhanced flipped learning group (n = 48) were more likely to complete the preclass and post-class activities on time than those in the non-gamified flipped learning group (n = 48). Students in the gamification-enhanced flipped learning group also produced higher quality artifacts than the non-gamified flipped learning group in the pre-class thinking activities. Moreover, students in the gamification-enhanced flipped learning group scored significantly higher in the post-course test than did their non-gamified counterparts.;"[Huang, Biyun; Hew, Khe Foon; Lo, Chung Kwan] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China";Huang, BY (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;lucy99@connect.hku.hk;"Huang, Lucy/ABA-6040-2020; Hew, Khe/ABB-1737-2020";"Hew, Khe/0000-0003-4149-533X; Cai, Zhicheng/0000-0002-8702-6216; Huang, Biyun/0000-0003-0555-9973";NA;NA;NA;62;60;61;46;104;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1049-4820;1744-5191;NA;INTERACT LEARN ENVIR;Interact.

Many academics believe that students expect their university learning experiences to be enjoyable, and discourses of game-based learning reflect this, with a dominant narrative highlighting the fun of educational games. Whether students expect learning to be fun or see a relationship between fun and games is under-explored. To address this, we investigated student perceptions of fun in Higher Education using a thematic network analysis based on data from 37 in-depth interviews with undergraduate students. Here, we highlight five themes that encapsulate what students perceive to be a fun learning experience: stimulating pedagogy; lecturer engagement; a safe learning space; shared experience; and a low-stress environment. These aspects are not unique to games, and we conclude by considering the relationship between educational games and fun, and alternative playful approaches.";"[Whitton, Nicola] Univ Durham, Durham Ctr Acad Dev, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Langan, Mark] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Manchester, Lancs, England";Whitton, N (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Durham Ctr Acad Dev, Durham DH1 3LE, England.;nicola@whittons.com;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;66;13;13;3;54;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1356-2517;1470-1294;NA;TEACH HIGH EDUC;Teach.

One of the most popular games in recent years is the Escape Room, but the study of its use in education and with health professionals is still limited. The aim of this study was to find out the perceptions and experiences of final year nursing students in an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) by means of an Escape Room. Methods: In January 2019, 9 focus groups (FG) were held, with a total of 95 final year nursing students. We applied a qualitative content analysis approach and ATLAS.ti version 8 was used for data analysis. Results: The data revealed 3 main themes and 8 sub-themes. The three main themes, which were mapped to the conceptual framework, were student learning outcomes, emotional impact on students and conclusions on the serious games experience. Both the main themes and the sub-themes were illustrated using representative quotes from the participants. Conclusions: These results can help to apply these methodologies, such as the Escape Room, alongside other pre-existing ones, complementing the way in which students are assessed and the development of important nursing skills, such as teamwork and communication.;"[Roman, Pablo; Marquez-Hernandez, Veronica V.; Gutierrez-Puertas, Lorena] Univ Almeria, Dept Nursing Physiotherapy & Med, Fac Hlth Sci, Almeria, Spain; [Roman, Pablo; Marquez-Hernandez, Veronica V.] Univ Almeria, Res Grp CTS 451 Hlth Sci, Almeria, Spain; [Roman, Pablo] Univ Almeria, Hlth Res Ctr, Fac Hlth Sci, Almeria, Spain; [Rodriguez-Arrastia, Miguel; Ropero-Padilla, Carmen] Jaume I Univ, Predept Nursing, Fac Hlth Sci, Ave Sos Baynat, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Spain; [Molina-Torres, Guadalupe] Univ Granada, Dept Physiotherapy, Fac Hlth Sci, Melilla, Spain";Rodriguez-Arrastia, M (corresponding author), Jaume I Univ, Predept Nursing, Fac Hlth Sci, Ave Sos Baynat, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Spain.;arrastia@uji.es;"Gutierrez-Puertas, Lorena/ABG-4135-2020; Rodriguez-Arrastia, Miguel/R-2920-2018; Ropero-Padilla, Carmen/R-2926-2018; Marquez-Hernandez, Veronica V./ABE-7896-2020";"Gutierrez-Puertas, Lorena/0000-0003-3565-7881; Rodriguez-Arrastia, Miguel/0000-0001-9430-4272; Ropero-Padilla, Carmen/0000-0001-5883-767X; Marquez-Hernandez, Veronica V./0000-0003-1163-4394";Education Innovation Group Grant as part of the Escape Room and clinical simulation: clinical evaluation based in games Project within Creation of Innovative and Good Teaching Practice in the University of Almeria Call.

Programming is a challenging and highly important topic for introducing learners to our digital world. Research has shown that motivation plays a key role in programming performance. Gamification using digital badges has the potential to influence motivation, provide social recognition and encourage learner participation. More research is recommended to evaluate its motivational impact in different contexts. Intervention. This research explores the effects of badges on the intrinsic motivation levels of introductory programming students within a higher education institution. The course is offered during the first year of the programme. We report the results of a baseline study without badges and four subsequent badge experiments of different designs over a four-year period. Methods. This quasi-experimental study followed a pre-test/post-test design to measure the effects of badges on the intrinsic motivation levels of university-level introductory programming students. Badges were designed and implemented. Feedback via focus groups and a post-badge survey was collected. Results. Findings are inconclusive as the quantitative results suggest that badges did not increase intrinsic motivation scores. Contrastingly, badge survey and qualitative data indicate that badges were received more positively on average. Discussion. We analyse and discuss the results within the context of motivation and the programming discipline, and discuss external factors that may impact the relationship between gamification and motivation. Conclusion. Further research is necessary to investigate whether gamification, through the use of digital badges, can foster positive intrinsic motivational results, particularly in the well-known challenging domain of introductory programming.;"[Facey-Shaw, Lisa] Univ Technol Jamaica, SCIT, Grad Studies, Kingston, Jamaica; [Facey-Shaw, Lisa; Bartley-Bryan, Jeanette] Univ Technol Jamaica, Open & Distance Learning, Kingston, Jamaica; [Specht, Marcus] Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands; [van Rosmalen, Peter] Maastricht Univ, Fac Ilealth Med & Life Sci, Taskforce Instruct Design & E Learning, Maastricht, Netherlands";Facey-Shaw, L (corresponding author), Univ Technol Jamaica, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, 237 Old Hope Rd, Kingston 6, Jamaica.;"lshaw@utech.edu.jm; m.m.specht@tudelft.nl; p.vanrosmalen@maastrichtuniversity.nl; jmbartley@utech.edu.jm";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;66;5;5;2;15;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;1046-8781;1552-826X;NA;SIMULAT GAMING;Simul.

The iSpring Learn learning management system was used as a low-tech gamification application in gamifying the flipped learning class. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research approach was used for collecting the data. Three formative assessments were used to examine students' learning performance during the intervention period, and a post-questionnaire survey was used to support the data collection process with regard to students' perceived needs satisfaction. In total, 56 students were involved in a non-randomised experiment with a control group design. Findings The results reveal that Assessment 1 showed no significant difference between the two intervention groups (p > 0.05), while Assessments 2 and 3 were significantly different (p < 0.05). The survey results confirm that participants in the GFC have achieved a great level of motivation because their innate psychological needs for competence, autonomy and relatedness are satisfied.

These problems relate to aspects of group dynamics including group cohesion, participation, communication, collaboration, and trust. Although the literature suggests various instructional techniques to increase group cohesion and learners' attitudes towards group learning environments, new methods and techniques should be explored in order to address and eliminate these problems. Gamification, which is the use of game elements and techniques in non-gaming environments, can be leveraged as a new method in order to increase group cohesion and group performance within collaborative learning environments. The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of gamification (both online and face-to-face) on the attitudes of students towards group learning environments, their course, group cohesion, and their academic achievement. The study aims to promote learners' collaboration in groups utilizing gamification elements. In this quasi-experimental design study, gamified (44 students) and traditional (48 students) groups were compared. Although no significant difference was established between the gamified and traditional groups in terms of students' attitudes towards group learning environments and the course, the gamified group outperformed the traditional group in terms of group cohesion scores and team member evaluation scores.;"[Bilgin, Cigdem Uz] Yildiz Tech Univ, Educ Fac, TR-34220 Istanbul, Turkey; [Gul, Abdulmenaf] Hakkari Univ, Educ Fac, TR-30000 Hakkari, Turkey";Bilgin, CU (corresponding author), Yildiz Tech Univ, Educ Fac, TR-34220 Istanbul, Turkey.;"uzcigdem@gmail.com; menafgul@gmail.com";", Cigdem/AAL-5086-2020; Uz, Cigdem/AAI-7871-2021";Uz, Cigdem/0000-0001-6997-344X;NA;NA;NA;63;3;3;3;22;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;8756-3894;1559-7075;NA;TECHTRENDS;TechTrends;JAN;2020;64;1;NA;NA;NA;NA;124;136;NA;10.1007/s11528-019-00442-x;NA;nov/19;13;Education & Educational Research;Education & Educational Research;KJ4FS;WOS:000495030700001;NA;NA;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Translating and applying the fruits of basic scientific results to various end-users and real-world scenarios is an increasingly important challenge for science. The field of metacognition has been a key component for the model of self-regulated learning. It has provided an important platform for translating this branch of research to educators, policymakers and learners. Nevertheless, theories and measurement models used in metacognitive research largely overlap with other fields, such as decision-making. This issue, titled 'Applied Metacognition: Real-word applications beyond learning', aims to inform and inspire the metacognitive research community to (occasionally) look beyond the role of metacognitive factors in self-regulated learning, to the multitude of other applied areas that can benefit end-users and real-world situations. Focusing on on-task confidence judgments, self-monitoring and evaluation, this issue includes seven empirical papers applying metacognitive models to the gamification of metacognitive assessment, decision-making and problem-solving, with implications for cybersecurity, eyewitness testimony, education and business.;"[Kleitman, Sabina] Univ Sydney, Sch Psychol, A18,441, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Narciss, Susanne] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Psychol Psychol Learning & Instruct, Sch Sci, D-01062 Dresden, Germany";Kleitman, S (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Psychol, A18,441, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.;"Sabina.kleitman@sydney.edu.au; Susanne.narciss@tu-dresden.de";Narciss, Susanne/AAC-9590-2020;"Narciss, Susanne/0000-0002-4280-6534; Kleitman, Sabina/0000-0001-5772-5019";NA;NA;NA;36;1;1;2;11;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1556-1623;1556-1631;NA;METACOGN LEARN;Metacogn.

Many researches have developed gamification models supporting a variety of motivational characteristics to provide engagement solutions for different areas. Objective: This paper carries out a systematic mapping in the field of gamification, looking for models with motivational characteristics in an attempt to characterise the state of the art of this field, identifying gaps and tendencies for further research. Method: We carried out a systematic mapping aiming at finding the primary studies in the existing literature, which were later classified and analysed according to twelve criteria. Results: We analysed 70 papers that resulted in 17 primary studies, published until September 2016. Most of them focus on Education, making use of Gamification to increase the motivation of a learning process. The gamification mechanics and elements most used were Badges/Achievements and Points/ExperiencePoints(XP), and most of the studies were not validated, thus not providing empirical evidence of the impact of gamification.

Objective: Describe the experience of the Risk Management sector at the quality and safety awareness event in a sentinel public university hospital. Method: This is a descriptive experience report study that used the active methodology called Gamification to promote patient quality and safety. The event was held in April 2018, in a high-complexity university hospital located in northern Parana, inserted in the Sentinel Hospitals Network of the National Health Surveillance Agency. Results: Approximately 325 people were involved among health professionals, administrative technicians, teachers, residents, academics and external community who participated in the various proposed activities. Nine challenges were made for the dissemination of knowledge on the subject. Concurrent with the activities, the judging committee met to assess the challenges and score points, displayed on the scoreboard posted in the hospital hall. The award of the winning team was a lunch at a renowned restaurant, and for the others, certificates and medals. Conclusion: The use of games and dynamics is a pedagogical tool that provides learning and collaborates in the dissemination of the theme of quality and safety, as well as provides interaction between employees.

There are multiple risk factors that together create an increased risk for children in traffic, some of the major reasons include children's inability to efficiently and actively scan the environment and look for information relevant to the traffic environment, inconsistent behavior, and less developed hazard perception skills. Traffic safety education is one of the most important means for improving knowledge and skills required for children to behave safely in traffic. This study evaluated a newly developed and gamified e-learning platform meant to promote traffic safety among elementary school pupils in Belgium. Participants in this study were from four grades of elementary school and voluntarily took part in the training. They followed a self-study program at home for approximately 15 min per week over a period of 5 weeks in total. The platform included four modules: traffic knowledge, situation awareness, risk detection, and risk management. For each of these modules, a set of photos and videos were used as stimuli and selected from a database of camera recordings of real-life situations. Half of each module consisted of familiar situations for the pupils (i.e., own municipality), while the other half of each module consisted of unfamiliar situations for the pupils (i.e., other municipalities). A fifth module, the finale, contained a mix of the first four modules. In total, 44 elementary school pupils (9-13 years old) completed the program. During the first round of measurement (i.e., the first four modules), pupils performed significantly better in the traffic knowledge module when compared with the other three modules. Further, in comparison with unfamiliar situations, pupils scored significantly higher in familiar situations. During the second round of measurement (i.e., the fifth module), pupils achieved higher scores in the risk detection and risk management modules when contrasted to the first measurement. The effect of gamification elements is discussed and the results also indicate the type of traffic safety issues to be emphasized in traffic safety education for children.;"[Riaz, Malik Sarmad; Cuenen, Ariane; Janssens, Davy; Brijs, Kris; Wets, Geert] UHasselt, Transportat Res Inst IMOB, Agoralaan, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium";Riaz, MS (corresponding author), UHasselt, Transportat Res Inst IMOB, Agoralaan, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium.;Maliksarmad.riaz@uhasselt.be;NA;Riaz, Malik Sarmad/0000-0001-8913-8986;NA;NA;NA;75;2;2;4;12;SPRINGER LONDON LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;1617-4909;1617-4917;NA;PERS UBIQUIT COMPUT;Pers.

The project targets formal and informal caregivers of persons with dementia in order to improve caregiver knowledge and competences skills with a non-traditional source of training. This paper describes the steps faced to define the iDO caregiver behavior improvement model, design of game mechanics, development of game art and game characters, and implementation of gameplay. Furthermore, it aimed to assess the direct impact of the game on caregivers (n = 48) and seniors with early signs of dementia (n = 14) in Lithuania measured with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Dementia Attitudes Scale (DAS). The caregivers' GDS scores showed a decrease in negative answers from 13.4% (pre-game survey) to 5.2% (post-game survey). The seniors' GDS scores showed a decrease in negative answers from 24.9% (pre-game survey) to 10.9% (post-game survey). The overall DAS scores increased from 6.07 in the pre-game survey to 6.41 in the post-game survey, statistically significant for both caregivers and seniors (p < 0.001), respectively. We conclude that the game aroused positive moods and attitudes for future caregivers of persons with dementia, indicating a more relaxed status and a decreased fear in accomplishing the caring process.;"[Maskeliunas, Rytis; Damasevicius, Robertas] Silesian Tech Univ, Inst Math, Kaszubska 23, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland; [Maskeliunas, Rytis; Damasevicius, Robertas; Paulauskas, Andrius] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Informat, Student 50, LT-51368 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Lethin, Connie] Lund Univ, Fac Med, Dept Hlth Sci, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Lethin, Connie] Lund Univ, Dept Clin Sci, Clin Memory Res Unit, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Esposito, Anna] Univ Vanvitelli, Dipartimento Psicol, Viale Ellittico 31, I-81100 Caserta, Italy; [Catena, Mauro; Aschettino, Vincenzo] Tech4Care, Via Guglielmo Marconi 31, I-60015 Falconara Marittima An, Italy";"Damasevicius, R (corresponding author), Silesian Tech Univ, Inst Math, Kaszubska 23, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland.; Damasevicius, R (corresponding author), Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Informat, Student 50, LT-51368 Kaunas, Lithuania.";"Rytis.maskeliunas@polsl.pl; robertas.damasevicius@polsl.pl; connie.lethin@med.lu.se; andrius.paulauskas@ktu.lt; iiass.annaesp@tin.it; mauro.catena@gmail.com; v.aschettino@tech4care.it";"Lethin, Connie/J-4296-2019; Maskeliunas, Rytis/J-7173-2017; Damasevicius, Robertas/E-1387-2017; ESPOSITO, Anna/P-4018-2015";"Lethin, Connie/0000-0002-2523-8440; Maskeliunas, Rytis/0000-0002-2809-2213; Damasevicius, Robertas/0000-0001-9990-1084; ESPOSITO, Anna/0000-0002-7268-1795";Erasmus programme of the European Union [2017-1-SE01-KA202-034585];Co-funded by the Erasmus programme of the European Union, project-ID: 2017-1-SE01-KA202-034585.;NA;64;3;3;3;6;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2078-2489;NA;INFORMATION;Information;NOV;2019;10;11;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;355;10.3390/info10110355;NA;NA;15;Computer Science, Information Systems;Computer Science;JU4CP;WOS:000501625300020;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

However, many of them consider it difficult. Furthermore, many find these topics less appealing and not connected to their future specialization in different fields of clinical medicine. Student-centred strategies such as problem-based learning, gamification and the use of real data can increase the appeal of a difficult topic such as genetic testing, a field at the crossroads of genetics, molecular biology and bioinformatics. Methods We designed an electronic teaching application which students registered in the undergraduate Medical Biology course can access online. A study was carried out to assess the influence of implementation of the new method. We performed pretest/posttest evaluation and analyzed the results using the sign test with median values. We also collected students' personal comments. Results The newly developed interactive application simulates the process of molecular genetic diagnostics of a hereditary disorder in a family. Thirteen tasks guide students through clinical and laboratory steps needed to reach the final diagnosis. Genetics and genomics are fields strongly dependent on electronic databases and computer-based data analysis tools. The tasks employ publicly available internet bioinformatic resources used routinely in medical genetics departments worldwide. Authenticity is assured by the use of modified and de-identified clinical and laboratory data from real families analyzed in our previous research projects. Each task contains links to databases and data processing tools needed to solve the task, and an answer box. If the entered answer is correct, the system allows the user to proceed to the next task. The solving of consecutive tasks arranged into a single narrative resembles a computer game, making the concept appealing. There was a statistically significant improvement of knowledge and skills after the practical class, and most comments on the application were positive. A demo version is available at . Full version is available on request from the authors. Conclusions Our concept proved to be appealing to the students and effective in teaching medical molecular genetics.

The system features moderate gamification, intended to motivate the student to use the machine repeatedly. The system records each handwash stage, and those found to be difficult are identified and reported back. The gamification element alone was not sufficient to encourage repeated use of the machine, with only 13.6 per cent of 611 eligible students interacting with the machine on one or more occasion. Overall engagement remained low (mean sessions per user: 3.5, +/- 0.60 confidence interval), even following recruitment of infection control ambassadors who were given a specific remit to encourage engagement with the system. Compliance monitoring was introduced to explore how students used the system. Hand hygiene performance did not improve with repeated use. There was evidence that the stages-fingers interlaced, rotation of the thumb, rotation of the fingertips and rotation of the wrists-were more challenging for students to master (p=0.0197 to p<0.0001) than the back of the hand and of the fingers.

An important premise of entrepreneurship education is that it can be learned and students can be taught to formulate entrepreneurial mentality, skills and competencies, something that can result in the formulation of startups and business initiatives. Given the importance of entrepreneurship, the necessity to formulate efficient entrepreneurship education frameworks and training programs arise. In this work, we present the design of an entrepreneurship educational environment that is based on learning in 3D virtual worlds. Innovative 3D virtual reality technologies were utilized to provide immersive and efficient learning activities. Various topics of entrepreneurship education courses were designed and formulated to offer students the opportunity to obtain theoretical knowledge of entrepreneurship. The 3D virtual reality educational environment utilizes pedagogical approaches that are based on gamification principles, allowing students to study in immersive ways as well as in game-based learning activities on real challenges that can be found in business environments. The game-based learning activities can help students gain necessary skills, helping them to tackle everyday obstacles on their entrepreneurial pathways. An experimental study was performed to explore the learning efficiency of the environment and the gamified learning activities as well as assess their learning impact on student's motivation, attitude, and overall learning experience. The evaluation study revealed that the framework offers efficient gamified learning activities that increase students' motivation and assist in the formulation of entrepreneurship mentality, skills and competencies.;"[Grivokostopoulou, Foteini; Kovas, Konstantinos; Perikos, Isidoros] Univ Patras, Comp Engn & Informat Dept, Patras 26504, Greece";"Grivokostopoulou, F; Perikos, I (corresponding author), Univ Patras, Comp Engn & Informat Dept, Patras 26504, Greece.";"grivokwst@ceid.upatras.gr; kobas@ceid.upatras.gr; perikos@ceid.upatras.gr";Perikos, Isidoros/N-1363-2018;Perikos, Isidoros/0000-0002-6581-4676;[2015-3-RO01-KA205-022949];This work was partially conducted in the context of the European Erasmus+ VR4STEM project, grant number 2015-3-RO01-KA205-022949.;NA;56;3;3;2;8;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2071-1050;NA;SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL;Sustainability;OCT 2;2019;11;20;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;5623;10.3390/su11205623;NA;NA;17;"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies";"Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology";JP6US;WOS:000498398900080;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Still, there is no definite answer to how young audiences perceive the educational effects of experiencing this augmented space of communication as an immersive medium. This study is based on a survey of 400 students after they visited an AR technology-enhanced exhibition held by a local history museum. Two stimulus-response marketing scale metrics, widely used to assess TV commercials, were adapted for AR experiences and validated. The mediation analysis revealed an intervening emotional mechanism, in which the multisensory AR experience has educational effects through entertainment and empathy. An improved stimulus-response empirical model is proposed, in which AR technologies, as environmental multisensory stimuli, produce cognitive responses through emotional immersion. The findings have significance in improving how museums encode their message using AR technologies as a secondary communication medium with young audiences. By using a widely tested scale for evaluating TV commercials adapted to measure AR experiences, this study could inform museum professionals and application developers to improve AR implementation solutions as service tools for enhancing user experience.;"[Nechita, Florin; Rezeanu, Catalina-Ionela] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Fac Sociol & Commun, Brasov 500036, Romania";Nechita, F (corresponding author), Transilvania Univ Brasov, Fac Sociol & Commun, Brasov 500036, Romania.;"florin.nechita@unitbv.ro; catalina.rezeanu@unitbv.ro";"Nechita, Florin/B-4567-2019; Rezeanu, Catalina-Ionela/Y-9979-2018";"Nechita, Florin/0000-0002-5398-722X; Rezeanu, Catalina-Ionela/0000-0002-3085-5486";"National Cultural Fund Management, Romania; Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CCCDI-UEFISCDI, within PNCDI IIIConsiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI) [ERANET-FLAG-FuturICT2.0]";This work has been partially funded by National Cultural Fund Management, Romania (the data collection stage), and by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CCCDI-UEFISCDI, project number ERANET-FLAG-FuturICT2.0, within PNCDI III (data analysis, writing-review and editing stages).;NA;67;2;2;1;8;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2071-1050;NA;SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL;Sustainability;OCT 2;2019;11;20;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;5830;10.3390/su11205830;NA;NA;18;"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies";"Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology";JP6US;WOS:000498398900286;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

This phenomenon has caused it not only to be used in classrooms as concrete experiences but also in the field of science, where there has been a proliferation of research on educational gamification in recent years. This growing interest has led to this study, which consists of a scientometric analysis of the publications indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) impact databases on the emerging methodology of gamification in education. The following categories were surveyed: Education & Educational Research, Education Scientific Disciplines, Social Sciences Interdisciplinary and Psychology Educational. The sample comprised all scientific productions (articles and conference communications) from their first appearance until 2017, for a total of 345 documents. Scientometric analysis focused on analyzing chronological productivity, productivity according to the type of document and according to the publisher, the language and the distribution of productions according to Bradford's and Lotka's laws. The results show that quality scientific production has entered an exponential growth phase, which evinces an increased interest of this methodology in the classroom. The number of productions has declined in the last year, but the scientific quality of these results confirms the importance of gamification in the field.

Shulman's theories continue to largely guide current research on teacher knowledge. However, the impact caused by the new technologies has inspired new approaches like T-PACK, which put the focus on the teachers' digital competence. In order to address this goal, information has been collected by means of a questionnaire implemented in 22 universities, 13 Spanish (344 participants) and 9 British (162 participants). The analysis of data was conducted along three phases: a) examination of the structure of assessments regarding the usefulness of digital resources by analyzing latent classes; b) estimation of confirmatory factor models for variable evaluation processes, History as a formative subject and historical competencies; c) estimation of interclass differences by using confirmatory factor models. The results showed four types of response regarding the use of digital resources in the classroom that were polarized about two items: comics and video games.

Materials and Methods: We designed the serious game, CODIFICO, as an alternative way to teach ICD-10 diagnosis coding to undergraduate medical students. To assess the pedagogical effect of the game, we used the quasiexperimental pretest-posttest design. The participants began by completing a knowledge pretest on Blackboard. After the pretest, the teacher presented the game to the students and invited them to play it for 1 week. Then, the students completed the posttest on Blackboard. We applied the Wilcoxon test to establish the difference between the pretest and posttest. We designed a questionnaire to evaluate the participants' technology acceptance toward the game. Results: Sixty-one undergraduate medical students from a large Colombian private university took part. There was no statistically significant difference between the pretest and the posttest. However, the game had some positive effects on knowledge. The game was well accepted among the participants. Conclusion: The game, CODIFICO, was useful to teach diagnosis determination, not diagnostic coding. Some of the reasons that caused this situation were insufficient attention to the pedagogical theory, excessive reliance on clinical aspects of the medical training, limited resources, and lack of experience at the medical school to design gamification strategies.;"[Agudelo-Londono, Sandra] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Inst Publ Hlth, Bogota, DC, Colombia; [Gorbanev, Iouri; Cortes, Ariel] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Econ & Management Sch, Bogota, DC, Colombia; [Delgadillo, Vivian; Munoz, Oscar] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Med Sch, Bogota, DC, Colombia; [Delgadillo, Vivian; Munoz, Oscar] Hosp Univ San Ignacio, Bogota, DC, Colombia; [Gonzalez, Rafael A.; Pomares-Quimbaya, Alexandra] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Engn Sch, Bogota, DC, Colombia";Agudelo-Londono, S (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Inst Salud Publ, Cra 7 40-62 Edif Pablo VI,Piso 2, Bogota 110231, DC, Colombia.;sandra.agudelo@javeriana.edu.co;"Martinez, Ariel Emilio Cortes/AAQ-4305-2020; Munoz, Oscar/Q-2906-2019";"Martinez, Ariel Emilio Cortes/0000-0002-1169-9086; Munoz, Oscar/0000-0001-5401-0018";"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana [IDPPTA 6891/IDPRY 7020]; Hospital Universitario San Ignacio";The authors wish to thank Francisco J.

It has become a novel way of interaction among people and influences people's social lives and public opinion as well as people's purchasing decisions and businesses. Any website or platform that allows social interaction is considered to be a social media site. Social media use among children in 25 European countries has been reported to be 38% among 9-12 year olds and 77% among those aged 13-16 years. All these children report having their own profile on at least one social network site. While social networking provides children and adolescents with many opportunities and benefits, it also carries many risks. Among the benefits are socialization and communication enhancement, improving learning skills, positive impact on education and getting health information. Potential risks of social media use include falsifying age and identity, cyberbullying, sexting, Facebook depression, gamification, glamourization, cyberostracism and sleep disturbances. Conclusion: Paediatricians play a vital role in promoting the physical, mental and social welfare of all children. There is a critical need for paediatricians to play an active role, guiding children and families appropriately through the impact of social networking, in order to become a real driver of children's development.;"[Hadjipanayis, Adamos; Efstathiou, Elisavet] Larnaca Gen Hosp, Dept Paediat, CY-6042 Inomenon Polition, Larnaca, Cyprus; [Hadjipanayis, Adamos] European Univ Cyprus, Sch Med, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Hadjipanayis, Adamos; Efstathiou, Elisavet; Altorjai, Peter; Stiris, Tom; Valiulis, Arunas; Koletzko, Berthold; Fonseca, Helena] European Acad Paediat, Brussels, Belgium; [Altorjai, Peter] Assoc Hungarian Primary Care Paediat, Budapest, Hungary; [Stiris, Tom] Oslo Univ Hosp, Dept Neonatol, Oslo, Norway; [Stiris, Tom] Univ Oslo, Fac Med, Oslo, Norway; [Valiulis, Arunas] Vilnius Univ, Fac Med, Inst Clin Med & Hlth Sci, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Koletzko, Berthold] LMU Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munich, Dr von Hauner Childrens Hosp, Univ Munich, Med Ctr, Munich, Germany; [Fonseca, Helena] Univ Lisbon, Dept Paediat, Div Adolescent Med, Lisbon, Portugal";"Hadjipanayis, A (corresponding author), Larnaca Gen Hosp, Dept Paediat, CY-6042 Inomenon Polition, Larnaca, Cyprus.; Hadjipanayis, A (corresponding author), European Univ Cyprus, Sch Med, Nicosia, Cyprus.; Hadjipanayis, A (corresponding author), European Acad Paediat, Brussels, Belgium.";"adamos@paidiatros.com; liza.efstathiou@gmail.com; peter.altorjai@gmail.com; tom.stiris@medisin.uio.no; arunas.valiulis@mf.vu.lt; Berthold.Koletzko@med.uni-muenchen.de; helenaregalofonseca@gmail.com";Hadjipanayis, Adamos/M-6102-2016;"Hadjipanayis, Adamos/0000-0003-4337-3176; Altorjai, Peter/0000-0003-0388-1184; Fonseca, Helena/0000-0003-0565-1403";NA;NA;NA;63;1;1;2;32;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0340-6199;1432-1076;NA;EUR J PEDIATR;Eur.

Adaptation and validation of the Gameful Experience Scale [GAMEX];NURSE EDUCATION TODAY;NA;NA;English;Article;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"Nursing students; Validation studies; Game; Experience";"STUDENTS; KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION; SKILLS";Background: There has been an increasing amount of research in the last few years on the use of gamification in nursing. However, there is not yet a suitable measuring instrument that fully captures the emotional qualities that arise with the use of gamification. Objectives: To culturally adapt and validate the Gameful Experience Scale used among nursing students as well as understand their game experience. Design: The study was divided into two phases 1) cross-cultural adaptation and 2) validation of the scale and cross-sectional descriptive study. Settings: Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Almeria, Spain. Participants: 226 students studying an undergraduate nursing degree. Methods: In the first phase, a cross-cultural adaptation was carried out using a forward-back translation, with the collaboration of a panel of experts. In the second phase, the corresponding analyses were performed, to measure the reliability and the validity of the instrument. Results: The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test that measures the appropriateness of the sample had a result of 0.875. Bartlett's sphericity test was significant (X-2(351) = 3755.142, p < 0.05). A structure of 6 factors was confirmed. The total Chronbach a value was 0.855. In the analysis of the test-retest reliability, a correlation level of 0.89 was obtained (p < 0.05). The participants showed high scores in all the dimensions, except that of absence of negative effects. Conclusions: The adapted version of the scale showed good results in regards to reliability and validity, which indicates that it is an effective tool to be used to measure the game experience in nursing students' training.;"[Marquez-Hernandez, Veronica V.; Aguilera-Manrique, Gabriel; Granados-Gamez, Genoveva] Univ Almeria, Dept Nursing Physiotherapy & Med, Fac Hlth Sci, Res Grp Hlth Sci CTS 451, Sacramento S-N, La Canada De San Urbana 04120, Spain; [Garrido-Molina, Jose Miguel] Empresa Publ Emergencies Sanitarias 061, Edificio Antiguo Hosp Virgen Mar,Ctra Ronda,226, Almeria 04009, Spain; [Gutierrez-Puertas, Lorena; Garcia-Viola, Alba] Univ Almeria, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Nursing Physiotherapy & Med, Sacramento S-N, La Canada De San Urbana 04120, Spain";Gutierrez-Puertas, L (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Nursing Physiotherapy & Med, Sacramento S-N, La Canada De San Urbana 04120, Spain.;"vmh380@ual.es; lgp524@ual.es; gaguiler@ual.es; genoveva@ual.es";"Garrido-Molina, Jose Miguel/ABF-6961-2020; Marquez-Hernandez, Veronica V./ABE-7896-2020; Gutierrez-Puertas, Lorena/ABG-4135-2020";"Garrido-Molina, Jose Miguel/0000-0002-2813-9042; Marquez-Hernandez, Veronica V./0000-0003-1163-4394; Gutierrez-Puertas, Lorena/0000-0003-3565-7881; GARCIA-VIOLA, ALBA/0000-0002-7998-0261";NA;NA;NA;30;4;4;11;34;CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE;EDINBURGH;JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND;0260-6917;1532-2793;NA;NURS EDUC TODAY;Nurse Educ.

This practice marks a shift in the journalistic norms, positioning journalism and news users within the neoliberal paradigm. In this view, the study proposes a discursive approach to examine how gamified news discourse is colonized by the neoliberal values of marketization and commodification. The analysis takes a case study of Pirate Fishing: An Interactive Investigation, a gamified news launched by Al Jazeera. It is not just the narrative of Pirate that carries ideological bearings, rather the ludic design itself is found to be fit within the neoliberal mentality. Therefore, the ludic semiosis of Pirate Fishing is examined as well. As such, a dialectical relation between discourse, semiotics and neoliberal ideologies, in the context of gamification, is drawn in this article. Based on the analysis, seven interrelated neoliberal discourses are highlighted: 'calculative rationality', 'self-entrepreneurship', 'minimalism', 'aesthetic preferences', 'individualism', 'sovereign consumer' and 'personal responsibility'.;[Fawzy, Rania Magdi] Arab Acad Sci Technol & Maritime Transport, Alexandria, Egypt;Fawzy, RM (corresponding author), Arab Acad Sci Technol & Maritime Transport, Coll Language & Commun, Heliopolis POB 2033,Elhorria El Moshir Ismail St, Cairo, Egypt.;raniamagdi33@hotmail.com;Fawzy, Rania/ABF-5929-2020;Fawzy, Rania/0000-0002-3638-0514;NA;NA;NA;51;1;1;1;14;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;1750-4813;1750-4821;NA;DISCOURSE COMMUN;Discourse Commun.;OCT;2019;13;5;NA;NA;NA;NA;497;515;NA;10.1177/1750481319856202;NA;NA;19;Communication;Communication;IU5QH;WOS:000483641900002;NA;NA;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Absence of enough learning centers and effective learning tools aggravate the problem. Modern technology can be utilized fruitfully to find solutions to the learning difficulties experienced by the deaf. The purpose of this paper is to present SiLearn - a novel technology based tool for teaching/learning sign vocabulary. Design/methodology/approach The proposed mobile application can act as a visual dictionary for deaf people. SiLearn is equipped with features that can automatically detect both text and physical objects and convert them to their corresponding signs. For testing the effectiveness of the proposed mobile application quantitative analyses were done. Quantitative analysis is based on testing a class of 28 students belonging to St Clare Oral School for the Deaf, Kerala, India. This group consisted of 17 boys and 11 girls. Analysis was also done through questionnaire. Questionnaires were given to teachers, parents of deaf students learning sign language and other sign language learners. Findings Results indicate that as SiLearn is very effective in sign vocabulary development. It can enhance vocabulary learning rate considerably. Originality/value This is the first time that artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques are used for early stage sign language learning. SiLearn can equally be used by children, parents and teachers for learning sign language.;"[Joy, Jestin; Balakrishnan, Kannan] CUSAT, Dept Comp Applicat, Kochi, Kerala, India; [Joy, Jestin] Fed Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Angamaly, Kerala, India; [Sreeraj, M.] Sree Ayyappa Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Chengannur, India";"Joy, J (corresponding author), CUSAT, Dept Comp Applicat, Kochi, Kerala, India.; Joy, J (corresponding author), Fed Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Angamaly, Kerala, India.";jestinjoy@gmail.com;NA;, Jestin/0000-0003-0892-7874;NA;NA;NA;49;0;0;3;33;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2398-6263;NA;NA;J ENABLING TECHNOL;J.

The ubiquity of smartphone use and app methodology, as Grant argues, have the potential to disrupt racial knowledges and facilitate anti-racist action. I use Nicholas Mirzoeff's 'zones of appearance and non-appearance' and Derek Hook's discussion of 'racialising embodiment' to discuss the potential of one such app, Everyday Racism, to challenge and disrupt white supremacy. The Australian-based app uses gamification to encourage users to participate in 'bystander anti-racism'. However, by failing to question the neutrality of the default white bystander, the app risks reproducing hegemonic constellations of white agency versus racialized inaction. I argue that, in the zone of appearance, it is not enough to make racism apparent. It is necessary to appear.

More specifically, the aim was to empirically explore and develop knowledge about the process of designing for gamification teaching in K-12 education, to develop gamification teaching design principles and, in addition, to study how emergent technologies could be used in this context. Four sub-studies were conducted between 2014 and 2018 which included four groups of university students as co-creators in the teaching designs. The empirical material is based on observations from the field test in which school students tested university student designs. Post interviews were conducted with participating school teachers and university students. In addition, university student written reports were included. Findings illustrate four themes; 1) The design process of the gamification teaching activities, 2) The gamification teaching design principles developed, 3) The school students' experiences of the gamification designs and 4) Designing gamification teaching activities - a complex process. Findings show that designing for gamification teaching designs using emergent technologies is quite a complex process. This complexity concerns, among other things, the puzzle of combining the different knowledge domains into the TPACK Model (i.e. technological knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, content knowledge) in an emergent teaching practice (gamification) with the use of emergent technologies. The co-creation process and the move between these knowledge domain areas could maximize the effect of achieving a pedagogical balance concerning what school students perceive as fun without sacrificing focus on their knowledge acquisition and learning processes.";[Marell-Olsson, Eva] Umea Univ, Dept Appl Educ Sci, Umea, Sweden;Marell-Olsson, E (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Appl Educ Sci, Umea, Sweden.;eva.marell-olsson@umu.se;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;43;0;0;0;3;INTERACTION DESIGN & ARCHITECTURES;ROMA;INTERACTION DESIGN & ARCHITECTURES, ROMA, 00000, ITALY;1826-9745;2283-2998;NA;INTERACT DES ARCHIT;Interact.

Furthermore, a controlled and carefully designed experimental evaluation in terms of learning effectiveness of gamification is offered. The experiment was conducted with 44 participants randomly assigned to an experimental 'gamified' condition and a controlled 'non-gamified' condition. In both conditions the same learning material, to teach computer security, were used. The main difference between the two conditions was the integration of gamification in an e-learning system designed based on the proposed model. The results indicate that learning using the gamified version of the e-learning system produces better short-term and medium-term learning gain than learning using the non-gamified e-learning version.

Data sources PubMed (including MEDLINE), CINAHL, Science Direct (including EMBASE), BioMed Central, ACM digital, Emerald Insight, Google Scholar and Research Gate. Methods Studies that were published between 1 January 2002 and 31 May 2018 in English were included if the participants were adults, with at least one long-term condition, were able to self-administer their medication and were treated in primary care settings. The quality of evidence was assessed with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system and the risk of bias was appraised using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results From a total of 27 studies that matched the inclusion criteria, 12 were excluded due to low quality of evidence, 10 were rated moderate and 5 were rated high quality. All the included studies had low sample size and limited follow-up duration. Thirteen of the included studies found that the use of a PHR has increased medication adherence. The identified design features are reminders, education, personalisation and tailoring, feedback and alerts, gamification, medication management, medical appointment management, diary and self-monitoring, health condition management, set goals, patient's blog and tethered. It was impossible to draw conclusions as to which feature is important to what group of patients and why. The most frequently identified conditions were HIV and diabetes. This review did not identify any papers with negative results. It was not possible to numerically aggregate the PHR effect due to high heterogeneity of the medication adherence measurement, study type, participants and PHRs used. Conclusion Although we found recurrent evidence that PHRs can improve medication adherence, there is little evidence to date to indicate which design features facilitate this process.;"[Andrikopoulou, Elisavet; Scott, Philip; Good, Alice] Univ Portsmouth, Sch Comp, Fac Technol, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Andrikopoulou, Elisavet] Sch Comp, Buckingham Bldg,Lion Terrace, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Herrera, Helena] Univ Portsmouth, Sch Pharm & Biomed Sci, Fac Sci, Portsmouth, Hants, England";"Andrikopoulou, E (corresponding author), Univ Portsmouth, Sch Comp, Fac Technol, Portsmouth, Hants, England.; Andrikopoulou, E (corresponding author), Sch Comp, Buckingham Bldg,Lion Terrace, Portsmouth, Hants, England.";elisavet.andrikopoulou@port.ac.uk;Andrikopoulou, Elisavet/AAB-4404-2020;"Andrikopoulou, Elisavet/0000-0002-4614-2907; Herrera, Helena/0000-0003-0107-8128; Scott, Philip/0000-0002-6289-4260";NA;NA;NA;73;4;4;2;4;BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP;LONDON;BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND;2044-6055;NA;NA;BMJ OPEN;BMJ Open;SEP;2019;9;9;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;e028628;10.1136/bmjopen-2018-028628;NA;NA;9;Medicine, General & Internal;General & Internal Medicine;JO7XE;WOS:000497787600117;31558449;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

To reach this goal, a quality and inclusive education together with a proper and complete formation in technology (communications, robotics, programming, computational thinking (CT), etc.) must be imparted at all educational levels. Moreover, all individuals should have the same opportunities to develop their skills and knowledge, as stated in Goal 4 of the Sustainable Development Goals, Sustainable Education. Following this trend, in the present work, a practical experience about how to teach CT using robotics is developed, showing the results and evaluation of the lessons on robotics taught to students in their 4th year of compulsory secondary education, and where the students showed a high degree of apathy and demotivation. The teaching unit was based on an action research approach that includes a careful selection of pedagogical techniques and instruments to attract and keep the attention and interest of the students. In addition to the robotics lessons, a previous computational thinking training with Blockly Games was carried out, which contributed to noticeably increase the students motivation and to introduce them to the programming of robots. Moreover, gamification was used to motivate and evaluate the individual knowledge, and the students were required to present the work performed through a final project. The individual needs of the students were fulfilled with a daily monitoring. The results show that the pedagogical techniques, instruments and evaluation were adequate to increase the motivation of the students and to obtain a significant learning, showing how the teaching of CT may attract students that have lost interest and motivation, while providing them with abilities that will be essential for the learning throughout life.;"[Diaz-Lauzurica, Belkis; Moreno-Salinas, David] UNED, Dept Comp Sci & Automat Control, C Juan del Rosal 16, Madrid 28040, Spain";Moreno-Salinas, D (corresponding author), UNED, Dept Comp Sci & Automat Control, C Juan del Rosal 16, Madrid 28040, Spain.;"belkis.dialau@educa.jcyl.es; dmoreno@dia.uned.es";NA;Diaz L., Belkis/0000-0001-9679-616X;"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CICYT DPI2017-84259-C2-2-R]; UNED project [GID2016-6]";This work was funded by Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under project CICYT DPI2017-84259-C2-2-R.

To highlight some innovations in educational networking (EN) research, this paper provides a bibliometric overview of international EN research from 2000 to 2018. Based on a keyword search, a total of 1005 journal articles with 13,803 citations were obtained. Through careful bibliometric analyses, three main results were concluded. (1) The growth of EN articles and authors was up by 1.5 times from the first decade (2000-2009) to the current one (2010-2018). (2) The most influential journals (over 300 citations) were identified. The research scope covers education technology, higher education, education policy, and even AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) education. (3) Based on some popular bibliometric indicators, the changes of research trends can be seen from the comparison of the main streams, which are identified from the most influential articles. Classification of the main research streams was presented, providing a typological understanding of the EN literature. In the first decade of research, the two articles which ranked first in terms of overall citations and average citations are Horvat et al. (2003) (232 times) and Coburn and Russell (2008) (17.6 times), respectively. In the last decade, the article by Roblyer et al. (2010) received both the highest number of citations (407) and average citations (45.2). Finally, the main ideas of highly-cited articles were categorized into three research streams. While the EN research of the earlier decade focused on interpersonal relationships, that of the recent decade emphasized on some innovative networking approaches, such as social media for learning, and network-based methodologies.

Despite its potential and the increasing number of gamified systems their success is still limited due to the fact that gamifying learning is a challenging process. Part of the challenge stems from an insufficient understanding of the motivational mechanisms of gamification on learners' experience and from the insufficient attention to factors contributing to gameful experiences and promoting sustainable engagement. In addition, there is limited empirical evidence on motivational influences driving students to participate in gamified learning activities. Another factor slowing down the progress of successfully gamified applications is the scarcity of tools that would enable instructors to design and implement gamified activities as part of their instructional strategy. In an attempt to address these challenges, the present paper examines the difficulties inherent in the gamification of educational activities and how the OneUp gamification platform can support instructors in overcoming them with the mechanisms it provides for affording gameful experiences and sustainable engagement. To add to the understanding of the motivational influences towards gamified learning activities, the paper presents a preliminary study of student motivation to use One Up for out-of-class practicing in a gamified Data Structures course.

However, while the number of publications on gamification has been increasing in recent years, a classification of its empirical effects is still missing. We present a systematic literature review conducted with the purpose of closing this gap by clarifying what effects gamification generates on users' behaviour in online learning. Based on the studies analysed, the game elements most used in the literature are identified and mapped with the effects they produced on learners. Furthermore, we cluster these empirical effects of gamification into six areas: performance, motivation, engagement, attitude towards gamification, collaboration, and social awareness. The findings of our systematic literature review point out that gamification and its application in online learning and in particular in Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) are still a young field, lacking in empirical experiments and evidence with a tendency of using gamification mainly as external rewards.

This paper presents an experience of a MOOC of Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (Spain) with a connectivist approach. Aspects such as fun and motivation have been worked on in the design, through the application of gamified activities and the use of elements from social networks, considered as gamification, with the aim of increasing participation and engagement within a Facebook group, used as a community to support the course. We have analyzed aspects such as enjoyment and motivation, the result of which has been active participation and high engagement within the MOOC community in the form of content and especially great interaction, highlighting the existence of continuous activity once the edition of the MOOC is finished, as a consequence of a habit generated in the student.;"[Borras-Gene, Oriol] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Ciencias Comp Arquitectura Comp Lenguajes &, LITE Grp, Madrid 28933, Spain; [Martinez-Nunez, Margarita; Martin-Fernandez, Luis] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Ingn Org Adm Empresas & Estadist, Madrid 28031, Spain";Borras-Gene, O (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Ciencias Comp Arquitectura Comp Lenguajes &, LITE Grp, Madrid 28933, Spain.;oriol.borras@urjc.es;"Martinez-Nunez, Margarita/K-9799-2014; Borras-Gene, Oriol/A-3712-2015";"Martinez-Nunez, Margarita/0000-0002-4135-5735; Borras-Gene, Oriol/0000-0002-1866-1857";"MINECO [TIN2015-66731-C2-1-R]; Madrid Regional Government, through the project e-Madrid-CM [P2018/TCS-4307]; FSEEuropean Social Fund (ESF); FEDEREuropean Commission";This work was supported by research grants iProg of MINECO (ref.

However, if teachers themselves are not motivated, or if they lack a positive attitude towards implementing these new methodologies, it will be difficult for students to feel motivated when approaching said resources. Therefore, it is important to know what teachers' attitudes towards them are. The aim of this research is the creation of an attitudes scale towards collaborative learning with video games, aimed at in-service primary school teachers. Different methodological steps were followed that made its construction possible, such as the analysis of items and the verification of their reliability, resulting in a rigorous attitudes scale of 33 items, with a reliability of alpha = 0.947. This implies that the measurement instrument is validated and allows one to know the attitudes of in-service primary school teachers towards a new methodology related to the implementation of video games in education.;"[Martin-del-Pozo, Marta; Garcia-Valcarcel Munoz-Repiso, Ana; Hernandez Martin, Azucena] Univ Salamanca, Dept Didact Org & Res Methods, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain";Martin-del-Pozo, M (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Dept Didact Org & Res Methods, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain.;mmdp@usal.es;"del Pozo, Marta Martin/H-3815-2015; Martin, Azucena Hernandez/H-5306-2015; Garcia-Valcarcel, Ana/K-7150-2014";"del Pozo, Marta Martin/0000-0002-1971-7904; Martin, Azucena Hernandez/0000-0002-6731-7710; Garcia-Valcarcel, Ana/0000-0003-0463-0192";Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport of Spain [FPU13/02194];In terms of the first author, this research was made possible through the funding of a FPU predoctoral grant (FPU13/02194) from the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport of Spain.;NA;48;3;3;0;3;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2227-9709;NA;INFORMATICS-BASEL;Informatics-Basel;SEP;2019;6;3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;30;10.3390/informatics6030030;NA;NA;13;Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications;Computer Science;JC3OF;WOS:000489187300005;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Large companies are leading in the creation of educational video games for their internal training or to enhance their public image and universities can benefit from collaborating. The aim of this research is to evaluate, both objectively and subjectively, the potential of the simulation game BugaMAP (developed by the MAPFRE Foundation) for university teaching about insurance. To this end, we have assessed both the game itself and the experience of using the game as perceived by 142 economics students from various degree plans and courses at the University of Seville during the 2017-2018 academic year. As a methodology, a checklist of gamification components is used for the objective evaluation, and an opinion questionnaire on the game experience is used for the subjective evaluation. Among the results several findings stand out. One is the high satisfaction of the students with the knowledge acquired using fun and social interaction. Another is that the role of the university professors and the company monitors turns out to be very active and necessary during the game-learning sessions. Finally, in addition to the benefits to the university of occasionally available quality games to accelerate student skills training, the company-university collaboration serves as a trial and refinement of innovative tools for game-based learning.;"[Rojo, Teresa] Univ Seville, Dept Sociol, Seville 41001, Spain; [Gonzalez-Limon, Myriam] Univ Seville, Dept Anal Econ & Econ Polit, Seville 41001, Spain; [Rodriguez-Ramos, Asuncion] Univ Seville, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Seville 41001, Spain";Rojo, T (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Dept Sociol, Seville 41001, Spain.;"trojo@us.es; miryam@us.es; asunrod@us.es";"Rojo, Teresa/F-6297-2013; Rodriguez Ramos, Asuncion/K-2425-2014; Gonzalez-Limon, Myriam/F-1320-2014";"Rojo, Teresa/0000-0001-6220-4242; Rodriguez Ramos, Asuncion/0000-0003-2761-9236; Gonzalez-Limon, Myriam/0000-0002-6569-7545";Fundacion MAPFRE;We gratefully acknowledge the support provided by Fundacion MAPFRE in making possible the application of the game BugaMEP at the University of Sevilla.

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the short-term effectiveness of Fit, Food, Fun (FFF), a serious game to impart nutritional knowledge among children and adolescents. Data collection was conducted at two secondary schools in Bavaria, Germany. The gameplay intervention (gameplay group; GG) consisted of a 15-minute FFF gameplay session during each of three consecutive days. The teaching intervention (teaching group; TG) was performed in a classic lecture format. Nutritional knowledge was evaluated via questionnaires at baseline and post-intervention. Statistical analyses were performed using R (R Core Team, 2018). In total, baseline data were available for 39 participants in the GG and 44 participants in the TG. The mean age was 13.5 +/- 0.7 years in the GG and 12.8 +/- 0.9 years in the TG. There was a significant (p-value < 0.001) improvement in nutritional knowledge in both intervention groups. Moreover, a between-group difference with a significantly (p-value = 0.01) higher increase in nutritional knowledge was detected for the TG. This pilot study provides evidence for the short-term effectiveness of both educational interventions on the improvement in nutritional knowledge.

It is generally agreed that by adding something fun to the learning process students become more engaged and, consequently, retain more knowledge. However, although the characteristics of video games facilitate the dynamics of the educational process it is necessary to plan a pedagogical project that includes delimitation of learning goals and profile of the addressees, the conditions of application of the educational project, and the methodologies of evaluation of the learning progress. This is how we can make a real difference between gamification and video game based learning. The paper addresses the design of an educational resource for special education needs (SEN) students that aims to help teach communicative skills related to prosody. The technological choices made to support the pedagogic issues that underlie the educational product, the strategies to convert learning content into playful material, and the methodology to obtain measures of its playability and effectiveness are described. The results of the motivation test certified that the video game is useful in encouraging the users to exercise their voice and the indicators of the degree of achievement of the learning goals serve to identify the most affected prosodic skills.;[Aguilar, Lourdes] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Hispan Philol, Barcelona 08193, Spain;Aguilar, L (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Hispan Philol, Barcelona 08193, Spain.;lourdes.aguilar@uab.es;NA;NA;"BBVA Foundation (2015-2017); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades [TIN2017-88858-C2-1-R, 1/2018-12/2020]; European Regional Development Fund FEDEREuropean Commission [TIN2017-88858-C2-1-R, 1/2018-12/2020]; Junta de Castilla y LeonJunta de Castilla y Leon [VA050G18]";The experiments described in this work were funded by BBVA Foundation (2015-2017) in the framework of the project PRADIA: Pragmatics and prosody: the graphic adventure game.

These technologies are also very important for the learning and transmission of intangible cultural heritage (ICH) creations, which include, among others, dance, theater, and other skills where body motion has a primary role. However, creating games can be time consuming and usually demands a significant effort. Therefore, this paper focuses on the design and development of a novel framework for the rapid design of body-motion-based customizable game-like applications. This framework consists of two components: (i) an interface that allows the user to design the game and capture the motion data, and (ii) a customizable game for learning and training using off-the-shelf motion-capture sensors like the Microsoft Kinect. The game is automatically configured based on the output of the game design interface. In order to evaluate the proposed system, three pilot-use cases have been selected: (i) the Latin dance Salsa, (ii) the Greek traditional dance Tsamiko, and (iii) the Walloon (Belgian) traditional dance. Moreover, small-scaled experiments concerning the three different use cases were conducted, where both beginners and experts evaluated the game-like application for dance learning. Furthermore, a group of dance experts were asked to design and generate their own game and evaluate their experience. Results showed that the use of such a game-like application could be efficient, as positive feedback was obtained. In summary, participants found that the generated game-like application meets its objectives; it is generally efficient and satisfactory and offers a novel tool for ICH transmission and education. Last but not the least, the dance experts expressed their interest in developing more such games in the future, since they characterized the game design module as easy and intuitive to use.";"[Grammatikopoulou, A.; Dimitropoulos, K.; Grammalidis, N.] CERTH, Inst Informat Technol, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Laraba, S.] Univ Mons, Numediart Inst, FPMs TCTS Lab, Mons, Belgium; [Sahbenderoglu, O.] Turkish Telecom, Istanbul, Turkey; [Douka, S.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Phys Educ & Sport Sci, Thessaloniki, Greece";Grammalidis, N (corresponding author), CERTH, Inst Informat Technol, Thessaloniki, Greece.;"agramm@iti.gr; sohaib.laraba@umons.ac.be; ozansahbenderoglu@gmail.com; dimitrop@iti.gr; sdouka@phed.auth.gr; ngramm@iti.gr";Grammalidis, Nikos/U-9411-2019;"Grammalidis, Nikos/0000-0001-8465-6258; Grammatikopoulou, Athina/0000-0001-9634-3064";"European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7-ICT-2011-9) [FP7-ICT-600676]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programm [691218]";The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7-ICT-2011-9) under grant agreement no FP7-ICT-600676 i-Treasures: Intangible Treasures-Capturing the Intangible Cultural Heritage and Learning the Rare Know-How of Living Human Treasures (Feb. 2013-Apr. 2017) and European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programm under grant agreement No 691218 Terpsichore: Transforming Intangible Folkloric Performing Arts into Tangible Choreographic Digital Objects.

Design/methodology/approach The use of the LEGO (R) SERIOUS PLAY (R) (LSP) method in the context of transformative learning in Higher Education was used to drive a Situational analysis with sixteen postgraduate nursing students, from African learning contexts. This methodological approach was used to specifically explore their identity as learners and then to facilitate processes of critical introspection on social constructivist learning opportunities. Findings Students' perceived LSP permitted a deeper level of critical introspection on their transformative learning journeys than alternative approaches, such as written discourse or extended narratives, could have provided. They also perceived that a major benefit of using the LSP method was that it enabled them to understand and articulate their stories more easily than if they verbally reported them first.

However, most of the currently available nutrition apps lack scientific evaluation and user acceptance. Objective: The objective of this study was the systematic design of a theory-driven and target group-adapted dietary mobile app concept to promote healthy eating habits with a focus on drinking habits as well as consumption of fruits and vegetables in adolescents and young adults, especially from disadvantaged backgrounds. Methods: The design process was guided by the behavior change wheel (BCW). The development process comprised 3 stages. In stage 1, the target behavior was specified, and facilitators and barriers were identified. Furthermore, important insights into target group interests, needs, and values in the field of nutrition and apps were revealed. To this end, 2 empirical studies were conducted with the target group. In stage 2, results of stage 1 were translated into behavior change techniques (BCTs) and, finally, into app functionalities and features. Consequently, in stage 3, the concept was evaluated and optimized through expert interviews. Results: Facilitators and barriers for achieving the target behavior were psychological capabilities (eg, self-efficacy), reflective motivation (eg, fitness), automatic motivation, social support, and physical opportunity (eg, time). Target group interests, needs, and values in the field of nutrition were translated into target group preferences for app usage, for example, low usage effort, visual feedback, or recipes. Education, training, incentives, persuasion, and enablement were identified as relevant intervention functions. Together with the target group preferences, these were translated via 14 BCTs, such as rewards, graded tasks, or self-monitoring into the app concept Challenge to go (C2go). The expert evaluation suggested changes of some app features for improving adherence, positive health effects, and technical feasibility. The C2go concept comprises 3 worlds: the (1) drinking, (2) vegetable, and (3) fruit worlds. In each world, the users are faced with challenges including feedback and a quiz. Tips were developed based on the health action process approach and to help users gain challenges and, thereby, achieve the target behavior. Challenges can be played alone or against someone in the community. Due to different activities, points can be collected, and levels can be achieved. Collected points open access to an Infothek (information section), where users can choose content that interests them. An avatar guides user through the app. Conclusions: C2go is aimed at adolescents and young adults and aims to improve their fruit and vegetable consumption as well as drinking habits. It is a theory-driven and target group-adapted dietary mobile intervention concept that uses gamification and was systematically developed using the BCW.;"[Rohde, Anna; Duensing, Anja; Dawczynski, Christine; Lorkowski, Stefan; Brombach, Christine] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Fac Biol Sci, Inst Nutr Sci, 2nd Fl,Dornburger Str 25, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Rohde, Anna; Duensing, Anja; Dawczynski, Christine; Lorkowski, Stefan] Competence Cluster Nutr & Cardiovasc Hlth, Halle, Germany; [Rohde, Anna; Godemann, Jasmin] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Commun & Engagement Agr Nutr & Environm Sci, Giessen, Germany; [Brombach, Christine] Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Inst Food & Beverage Innovat, Zurich, Switzerland";Rohde, A (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Fac Biol Sci, Inst Nutr Sci, 2nd Fl,Dornburger Str 25, D-07743 Jena, Germany.;at.anna.rohde@gmail.com;"Lorkowski, Stefan/B-9689-2008; Godemann, Jasmin/AAX-3968-2020";"Lorkowski, Stefan/0000-0002-9649-840X; Godemann, Jasmin/0000-0001-7201-563X; Dawczynski, Christine/0000-0002-4063-6199; Brombach, Christine/0000-0002-9216-9983; Duensing, Anja/0000-0002-7666-4669";Federal Ministry of Education and ResearchFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01EA1411C];This research was conducted within the Competence Cluster for Nutrition and Cardiovascular Health Halle-Jena-Leipzig, which is supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research under grant no. 01EA1411C.;NA;77;3;3;7;32;JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC;TORONTO;130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA;2291-5222;NA;NA;JMIR MHEALTH UHEALTH;JMIR mHealth uHealth;AUG 12;2019;7;8;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;e11575;10.2196/11575;NA;NA;17;"Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics";"Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics";IT3SN;WOS:000482775800001;30903746;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

However, to date, scant attention has been paid to practically linking this approach to formal curricula at the tertiary level in China. Given the situation, we designed a geolocation-based mobile AR scavenger hunt to explore students' perception of embedding technology-enhanced and gamified EE in their language learning process. Ninety-eight first-year students, majoring in English at a Chinese university, were invited to participate in this study. In this game, students need to find the answers to 24 environment-themed questions phrased in English. Guided by prior technology acceptance research, we employed a mixed methods approach to capture participants' experience and perception of the process. The results show that this approach was positively perceived among the participants, for it could not only enrich their language learning experience but also promote their awareness of the environment. The findings offer insights into how EE can be purposefully integrated with tertiary education by leveraging current technological and pedagogical innovations.;"[Mei, Bing] Henan Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, 85 Minglun St, Kaifeng 475001, Henan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Shuxia] Henan Univ, Inst Foreign Linguist & Appl Linguist, 85 Minglun St, Kaifeng 475001, Henan, Peoples R China";Yang, SX (corresponding author), Henan Univ, Inst Foreign Linguist & Appl Linguist, 85 Minglun St, Kaifeng 475001, Henan, Peoples R China.;hdysx@henu.edu.cn;Mei, Bing/J-2757-2019;"Mei, Bing/0000-0001-9185-7509; Yang, Shuxia/0000-0002-2460-6096";"Teacher Education Reform Project of Henan Provincial Educational Department [2019-JSJYYB 011]; Innovative Research Project of Henan University [2019CXTD007]";This study was funded by the Teacher Education Reform Project of Henan Provincial Educational Department (grant number: 2019-JSJYYB 011) and the Innovative Research Project of Henan University (grant number: 2019CXTD007).;NA;48;1;1;1;21;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2071-1050;NA;SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL;Sustainability;AUG;2019;11;16;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4292;10.3390/su11164292;NA;NA;12;"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies";"Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology";IV7UO;WOS:000484472500037;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Gamification is a technique used to increase student motivation and engagement in small-scale educational contexts. However, the effects of gamification on student engagement have been scarcely explored in MOOC environments, and the findings so far are inconsistent. To address this gap, this research work examines the students' behavior toward earning badges and how it relates to their engagement in a gamified MOOC. According to the results, the behaviors toward badges of the active students were generally positive and significantly correlated with other variables measuring their engagement (e.g., pageviews, submitted tasks, forum posts), although this positive behavior seems to decrease throughout the course. Additionally, students that reported high motivation by badges at the end of the course showed a higher engagement level than those that were not appealed by badges.;"[Ortega-Arranz, Alejandro; Er, Erkan; Bote-Lorenzo, Miguel L.; Asensio-Perez, Juan I.; Munoz-Cristobal, Juan A.] Univ Valladolid, Sch Telecommun Engn, Paseo Belen 15, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain; [Martinez-Mones, Alejandra] Univ Valladolid, Sch Comp Engn, Paseo Belen 15, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain";Ortega-Arranz, A (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Sch Telecommun Engn, Paseo Belen 15, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain.;alex@gsic.uva.es;"ER, Erkan/Q-6942-2019; Martinez-Mones, Alejandra/K-7810-2014; Cristobal, Juan Alberto Munoz/AAG-6488-2021; Bote-Lorenzo, Miguel L./D-5925-2012; Asensio-Perez, Juan I./E-7285-2011";"ER, Erkan/0000-0002-9624-4055; Martinez-Mones, Alejandra/0000-0003-3201-0345; Cristobal, Juan Alberto Munoz/0000-0002-5756-9439; Bote-Lorenzo, Miguel L./0000-0002-8825-0412; Asensio-Perez, Juan I./0000-0002-1114-2819";"Spanish State Research Agency (AEI); European Regional Development FundEuropean Commission [TIN2014-53199-C3-2-R, TIN2017-85179-C3-2-R, VA082U16, VA257P18]; Regional Government of Castilla y Leon; European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [588438-EPP-1-2017-1-EL-EPPKA2-KA]";This research has been partially funded by the Spanish State Research Agency (AEI) together with the European Regional Development Fund, under Project Grants TIN2014-53199-C3-2-R and TIN2017-85179-C3-2-R, the Regional Government of Castilla y Leon together with the European Regional Development Fund, under Project Grants VA082U16 and VA257P18, and the European Commission, under Project Grant 588438-EPP-1-2017-1-EL-EPPKA2-KA.

This strategy supports the Werbach and Hunter methodology. The dynamics were emotional, social, and progressive and were conducted through challenge and opportunities mechanics. The components were points, badges, avatars, and a leaderboard. In both interventions, surveys were used to know the acceptance of the strategy on behalf of the students, and a meta-evaluation instrument was applied after the first intervention with the purpose of strengthening and improving the didactic strategy.

Our study was designed to determine if scores on a comprehensive web-based review game correlate to overall pharmacotherapeutics course and course series grades. Educational activity and setting: Two cohorts of students in Pharmacotherapeutics IV, the last course in a four course series, were administered a web-based quiz review game (Kahoot!) at the end of the course. Student performance on the game was compared to grades throughout the Pharmacotherapeutics course sequence to determine if the games were reflective of the students' performances. All students enrolled in Pharmacotherapeutics IV in 2016 and 2017 were included in the analysis. Pearson correlation was performed on the scores from the review game compared to the grades in the pharmacotherapeutics course series. Findings: A total of 197 students, 111 in the 2016 cohort and 86 in the 2017 cohort, were included in the analysis. The correlation coefficient (r) for the review scores and Pharmacotherapeutics IV course grade was 0.399 and 0.461 for the 2 cohorts (p < 0.001). Almost all component comparisons between the review scores and the other pharmacotherapeutics course grades were also significantly correlated (p < 0.01). Summary: Student performance on the review game significantly correlated with pharmacotherapeutics course grades.

During the gameplay session, various game mechanisms trigger individual, social, and collective learning outcomes of the players, which in the end can lead to a change in the individual belief system towards the subject. Despite demonstrating its applicability in other complex domains, such as maritime spatial planning or urban development, an investigation into the applicability of serious games within the tourism domain is scarce. In conceiving the process of tourism planning as a strategic plan with dependent actors, resources, objectives, and challenges in a multi-layered decision-making process, creating or re-creating such strategic games can be beneficial to promote the understanding and change of belief systems among stakeholders. A particularly critically question is how serious gaming is able to generate qualitative research inquiries in order to shed more light on the complexities of the tourism destination planning process. Destination planning research can profit from new disruptive methods, such as serious gaming, for a more experimental and explorative approach in understanding the interconnectedness of tourism stakeholders, as well as estimations of short and long-term impact of decisions on a destination. By enabling strategic conversation about tourism planning issues, serious gaming functions as a strategic learning tool that provides opportunities for individual and community learning.

National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds competitive, investigator-initiated grant applications. Funded grants represent the state of the science and therefore are expected to anticipate the progression of research in the near future. Objective: The objective of this paper is to provide an analysis of the kinds of smartphone-based intervention apps funded in NIH research grants during the five-year period between 2014 and 2018. Methods: We queried NIH Reporter to identify candidate funded grants that addressed mHealth and the use of smartphones. From 1524 potential grants, we identified 397 that met the requisites of including an intervention app. Each grant's abstract was analyzed to understand the focus of intervention. Year of funding, type of activity (eg, R01, R34, and so on) and funding were noted. Results: We identified 13 categories of strategies employed in funded smartphone intervention apps. Most grants included either one (35.0%) or two (39.0%) intervention approaches. These included artificial intelligence (57 apps), bionic adaptation (33 apps), cognitive and behavioral therapies (68 apps), contingency management (24 apps), education and information (85 apps), enhanced motivation (50 apps), facilitating, reminding and referring (60 apps), gaming and gamification (52 apps), mindfulness training (18 apps), monitoring and feedback (192 apps), norm setting (7 apps), skills training (85 apps) and social support and social networking (59 apps).

Innovations in basic science teaching methods are needed to keep up with an ever-changing landscape of technology. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether students in a medical and dental histology course would have better grades if they used gaming software Kahoot (R) and whether gamification effects on learning and enjoyment.MethodsIn an effort to both evoke students' interest and expand their skill retention, an online competition using Kahoot (R) was implemented for first-year students in 2018 (n=215) at the University of Eastern Finland. Additionally, closed (160/215) or open-ended (41/215) feedback questions were collected and analyzed.ResultsThe Kahoot (R) gamification program was successful and resulted in learning gains. The overall participant satisfaction using Kahoot (R) was high, with students (124/160) indicating that gamification increased their motivation to learn. The gaming approach seemed to enable the students to overcome individual difficulties (139/160) and to set up collaboration (107/160); furthermore, gamification promoted interest (109/160), and the respondents found the immediate feedback from senior professionals to be positive (146/160). In the open-ended survey, the students (23/41) viewed collaborative team- and gamification-based learning positively.ConclusionThis study lends support to the use of gamification in the teaching of histology and may provide a foundation for designing a gamification-integrated curriculum across healthcare disciplines.";"[Felszeghy, Szabolcs; Pasonen-Seppanen, Sanna; Nieminen, Petteri; Harkonen, Kai; Paldanius, Kaisa M.

Existing literature describes progressive developments and assessments of IPE in colleges of pharmacy and medicine; however, there are fewer reports describing processes or projects that foster physician-pharmacist IPR in clinical practices without established interprofessional collaborations. Objectives: The primary objective was to establish IPR between pharmacists and osteopathic residents in a community teaching hospital. The secondary objective was to innovate the delivery of pharmacotherapeutic content delivered to the residents during their didactic lecture series by providing active learning strategies. Methods: This report describes a project wherein college of pharmacy faculty developed IPR with osteopathic residents in a community teaching hospital that previously did not have any established physician-pharmacist IPR. Osteopathic medical residents completed a post-implementation survey after they attended a 12-month series of didactic lectures that incorporated active learning delivered by pharmacist faculty. Results: Sixty-six residents were eligible to complete the survey; 20 residents completed the survey. Eighteen residents believed that both physicians and pharmacists should be educated to establish IPR and that it should be included in professional, graduate, and continuing education settings for both professions. Sixteen residents believed that the active learning techniques employed by college of pharmacy faculty were useful for IPR. Conclusions: Physician-pharmacist IPR may be achievable in settings where IPR was previously sparse. Shared interests, adherence, and innovations in IPR frameworks are essential for developing physician-pharmacist IPR.";"[Boylan, Paul M.; Sedlacek, Jordan; Santibanez, Melissa; Lounsbury, Nicole] Larkin Univ, Miami, FL 33169 USA; [Church, Andria F.] Palm Beach Atlantic Univ, W Palm Beach, FL USA; [Nguyen, Jacqueline] Reagan Med Ctr, Suwanee, GA USA";Boylan, PM (corresponding author), Larkin Univ, Coll Pharm, Dept Clin & Adm Sci, 18301 N Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33169 USA.;pboylan@ularkin.org;NA;"Santibanez, Melissa/0000-0003-3514-1279; Boylan, Paul/0000-0002-0719-8238";NA;NA;NA;31;1;1;0;1;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;8755-1225;1549-4810;NA;J PHARM TECHNOL;J.

To facilitate the design of gamified educational systems, in recent years, studies have proposed various approaches (e.g., methodologies, frameworks and models). One of the main problems, however, is that most of these approaches are theoretical, and do not provide a proof-of-concept. This paper advances the state of the art by providing a practical way to help implement this kind of system. In this study, we present, for the first time, how one can apply gamification elements in a learning system using the Design Sprint method, to guide designers and developers on replicating this process. Additionally, as starting point, we use a taxonomy composed of 21 game elements, proposed to be used within learning environments, organised into five game element categories, according to their goal/usage. Our main contribution is to present how to systematically implement the gamification elements focused on educationalends, which is of special value to practitioners, designers and developers.;"[Toda, Armando M.; Palomino, Paula T.; Oliveira, Wilk; Rodrigues, Luiz; Isotani, Seiji] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Math & Comp Sci, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Klock, Ana C.

In higher education, gamification is a methodology intending to motivate students to acquire academical knowledge and soft skills, while keeping them engaged and pleased with the learning process. This study reports the application of a gamified class concerning electric resistors, the first of a 12-topic discipline offered to 2nd-year students in physics and engineering. Adopting a Flipped Classroom methodology and a narrative based on household power consumption, traditional contents about resistors and electricity were taught. Also, instructions about how to use an ohm-meter and how to configure an electronic spreadsheet to do basic statistics were given. In order to customize and enrich the class, some optional contents (usually in a video) were made available. The access to the experimental activities was constrained by approval in four graded quizzes. Every activity was acknowledged by virtual coins to be converted in benefits (extra time to run final examinations, permission to consult class appointments and the opportunity to re-discuss a mistake in the final examination) and points, to rank students (leaderboard). Forty-five students attended the gamified class. No control group was implemented because this study aimed to find a good design for a gamified class, not to compare traditional to active methodologies. The overall student acceptance was excellent, and they reported that gamification can be a more engaging methodology than traditional classes, further developing soft skills and academic knowledge. However, the time spent to run the gamified class must be arranged, reducing the time inside the classroom. The opportunity to perform the experiment was considered essential, and could not be substituted by videos or texts since new doubts and concerns are pointed out during the practice when the teacher is present. Gamification can be a methodology capable of engaging and being enjoyable students, giving them more than just information but also soft skills.;"[Forndran, Freerik] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany; [Zacharias, Carlos Renato] Sao Paulo State Univ, UNESP, Guaratingueta, Brazil";Zacharias, CR (corresponding author), Sao Paulo State Univ, UNESP, Guaratingueta, Brazil.;crzacharias@gmail.com;NA;Zacharias, Carlos Renato/0000-0003-0409-0181;UNESP through the (I) NOVAGrad program;The authors acknowledge Hector Castelli Zacharias (Game Designer) by suggestions.

Gamification is related to the development of skills, motivation and commitment of students. The aim of this paper is to provide evidence of the benefits of gamification in the training itinerary of Business Administration students. To this end, two different experiences have been selected, based on the skills students train and the added value that these skills may provide. In the first case, this paper presents empirical evidence of the improvement on the final grade of students who have participated in the gamification experience. The benefits of the second experience are diverse and reach students, universities and companies. The success of both experiences is linked to their adaptation to the cultural traits of the millennials, whose learning process is conditioned by technology and by other features identified in literature.

However, it is considered that the key to the implementation of a gamified system is not in the use of technology itself but in the procedure of design and elaboration of it, being able to opt for non-technological alternatives when circumstances require it. Although there are works that include the steps to be followed to implement gamification in the classroom, those found show specific experiences that are difficult to extrapolate to areas of knowledge other than those tested. Thus, it is considered to be useful for teaching community, have a starting point that can guide you on the steps to follow and how to analyze them to correctly develop a gamified plan. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose the protocol to follow to gamily a subject, aimed at helping students acquire and reinforce the competences required by the European Higher Education Area. Each step of the process is analyzed and a series of non-technological activities are provided that can be effective in achieving the learning objective. Originality underlies the consideration that it is not essential to use video games, simulators or mobile applications for a gamified system to succeed. It contributes, in this way, with a rigorous framework that can be used as a reference by the educational community in its gamified processes.;"[Garcia Magro, Cristina; Martin Pena, Maria Luz; Diaz Garrido, Eloisa] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain";Magro, CG (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain.;"cristina.garcia.magro@urjc.es; luz.martin@urjc.es; eloisa.diaz@urjc.es";"Garcia, Cristina/L-2534-2014; Martin-Pena, Maria Luz/K-5152-2014";Martin-Pena, Maria Luz/0000-0002-6700-6293;NA;NA;NA;53;1;1;1;3;UNIV POLITECNICA VALENCIA;VALENCIA;DEPT CIENCIA ANIMAL, PO BOX 22012, VALENCIA, 46071, SPAIN;1989-9068;NA;NA;WPOM-WORKING PAP OPE;WPOM-Working Pap.

The idea is to break with traditional methodologies to connect with students through the didactic use of ICT. All this has meant a true innovation in the learning of some subjects, historically anchored to more traditional methods, such as the area of History, among others. Really, thinking about innovating is not just using technologies or including games in the classrooms (Gamification). It would be necessary to go further, encouraging critical thinking in the classroom, using our intelligences to the maximum as Howard Gardner (1983) contributed. In this article, we first analyze the reasons why it is necessary to innovate, change teaching methodologies and evolve in the digital career of Secondary Education and Baccalaureate in the area of History. Next, an educational experience of the use of ICT for the study of History is shown, analyzing the proposed ICT resources that, together with the development of Multiple Intelligences, open a great variety of opportunities for the proposed training to be complete and enriching.

However, these and other applications of technology to mediate language learning may be informed by reflecting not only on the present but perhaps more importantly on relevant insights from past research and practice. This article draws on selected studies and the author's experience to lay out five key lessons learned over more than three decades in CALL. These lessons involve understanding: 1) the cycle of technology adoption; 2) the dimensions of technology mediation in the language learning process; 3) the promise and limitations of CALL research; 4) the critical importance of teacher education and professional development in an age of continuous change; and 5) the need for learner training for effective technology use. Teachers, researchers, and developers alike are encouraged to reflect on these lessons as they create and seek to control the technologies, tasks, and activities of the future.";"[Hubbard, Philip] Stanford Univ, Language Ctr, Linguist, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hubbard, Philip] Stanford Univ, Language Ctr, English Foreign Students Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA";"Hubbard, P (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Language Ctr, Linguist, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; Hubbard, P (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Language Ctr, English Foreign Students Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;32;4;4;1;6;IGI GLOBAL;HERSHEY;701 E CHOCOLATE AVE, STE 200, HERSHEY, PA 17033-1240 USA;2155-7098;2155-7101;NA;INT J COMPUT-ASSIST;Int.

In this article, after providing a historical overview of educational gamification, a novel methodology is proposed based on the use of one of these serious games, specifically the tool Quizizz. This online tool is open access and free, which encourages teachers to reproduce the proposed methodology for their subjects. The methodological proposal is based on three principles: (i) the use of virtual resources in education; (ii) the effectiveness of collaborative learning; and (iii) the motivation that the gamification of the teaching-learning process awakens in students. The effectiveness of the methodology has been demonstrated by surveys to the students carried out before (pre-test) and after (post-test) an educational experience at two pre-university levels: Junior High School and High School. In the light of the results obtained, it has become evident that the proposed methodology favors: (i) the teaching-learning process, by raising the level of student engagement in the study of the subject; (ii) the resolution of multiple-choice tests with a more optimistic approach and self-confidence; (iii) students' greater predisposition for team work; and (iv) an entertaining and motivating educational environment.";"[Vergara Rodriguez, Diego; Gomez Vallecillo, Ana Isabel] Univ Catolica Avila, Avila, Spain; [Mezquita Mezquita, Jose Maria] IES Maestro Haedo, Zamora, Spain";Rodriguez, DV (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Avila, Avila, Spain.;diego.vergara@ucavila.es;Vergara, Diego/J-4827-2012;Vergara, Diego/0000-0003-3710-4818;NA;NA;NA;57;5;5;7;23;UNIV GRANADA, GRUPO INVESTIGACION FORCE;GRANADA;FUENTENUEVA S-N, GRANADA, 18071, SPAIN;1138-414X;1989-6395;NA;PROFESORADO;Profesorado;JUL-SEP;2019;23;3;NA;NA;NA;NA;363;387;NA;10.30827/profesorado.v23i3.11232;NA;NA;25;Education & Educational Research;Education & Educational Research;JV0MC;WOS:000502060400019;NA;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

More evidence is needed to determine the impact of game-based learning design on the student learning experience. This study used the IMMS instrument and user data to examine motivation within traditional courses and courses designed with game-based learning. The participants included 254 undergraduate students in two sections of the traditional course and two sections of the game-based learning course. The results showed that although students in all courses reported comparable motivation on the IMMS and similar time spent online, examination of user data indicated differences in effort persistence over the semester. Students in the GBL courses had a significantly higher number of interactions with content as compared to the traditional courses. This finding indicates that the leveling of content, adaptive release of optional content, and the ability to earn more points through a bank feature positively impacts effort persistence.;"[Nadolny, Larysa] Iowa State Univ, Sch Educ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Nation, Jeanna] Iowa State Univ, Variety Personal Finance & Financial Planning Cou, Ames, IA USA; [Fox, Jonathan] Iowa State Univ, Dept Human Dev & Family Studies, Ames, IA USA; [Fox, Jonathan] Iowa State Univ, Financial Counseling Clin, Ames, IA USA; [Fox, Jonathan] Iowa State Univ, Financial Counseling & Planning, Ames, IA USA";Nadolny, L (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Sch Educ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.;NA;NA;Nadolny, Larysa/0000-0002-2265-0026;NA;NA;NA;41;1;1;3;16;IGI GLOBAL;HERSHEY;701 E CHOCOLATE AVE, STE 200, HERSHEY, PA 17033-1240 USA;2155-6849;2155-6857;NA;INT J GAME-BASED LEA;Int.

Personalized education refers to the fact that students' characteristics must be considered to determine the type of teaching or instructional design that must be provided to him/her. Within the area of intelligent tutorial systems (STI), student characteristics are handled within the student's module and usually refer to the student's skills, learning styles and prior knowledge of the subject of interest. The latter is closely related to the need to constantly assess the student, which is a process that is not easy to perform manually. However, several public schools in Mexico there is not the infrastructure necessary to be able to use automated tools, in each of the classrooms.

In fact, across disciplines and contexts, the amplification of 21st century learning has been giving gamification a special place in education. There are numerous studies conducted on the use of gamification among school children, university students or even trainee teachers. Coincidentally, all of these studies have shown that gamification does impact their learning. Hence, as harmless as it seems, any teachers who are not equipped with such knowledge on the benefits of gamification may hinder their learners and themselves from reaching their utmost teaching and learning experience especially when it comes to grammar learning among the younger pupils. Considering this thought in mind, this research was conducted to prove that the use of Kahoot! helps the Year 3 pupils in retaining the English Irregular verbs. This quasi experimental designed research gathered data from a sample of 35 Year 3 pupils using the pre-test and post-test results. The findings which were analysed descriptively using sample t-test showed that pupils' performances in the post-test improved over the use of Kahoot! in classroom. In conclusion, this research provides an insight on number of ways that gamification can actually impacted the pupils' learning; especially in terms of memory retention. It also works as a stepping stone for more researches to study on the effectiveness of using Kahoot! in tackling any part of learning especially among the younger learners.";"[Yunus, Melor Md.] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Educ, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia; [bin Azman, Mohd Azmanuddin] Sekolah Kebangsaan Putrajaya Presint 14 1, Wp 62300, Putrajaya, Malaysia";Yunus, MM (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Educ, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia.;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;31;2;2;0;7;ARAB WORLD ENGLISH JOURNAL;KUALA LUMPUR;JALAN 34-24 WANGSA MAJU, KUALA LUMPUR, 53300, MALAYSIA;2229-9327;NA;NA;ARAB WORLD ENGL J;Arab World Engl.

Here, the design and application of the participatory simulation game Global Sustainability Crossroads is described, based on a global state-of-the-art energy-economy-environment model, which creates a virtual scenario where the participants are confronted with the design of climate mitigation strategies as well as the social, economic, and environmental consequences of decisions. The novelty of the game rests on the global scope and the representation of the drivers of anthropogenic emissions within the MEDEAS-World model, combined with a participatory simulation group dynamic flexible enough to be adapted to a diversity of contexts and participants. The performance of 13 game workshops with similar to 420 players has shown it has a significant pedagogical potential: the game is able to generate discussions on crucial topics which are usually outside the public realm such as the relationship between economic growth and sustainability, the role of technology, how human desires are limited by biophysical constraints or the possibility of climate tipping points.;"[Capellan-Perez, Inigo; Alvarez-Antelo, David; Miguel, Luis J.] Univ Valladolid, Res Grp Energy Econ & Syst Dynam, Escuela Ingn Ind, Paseo Cauce S-N, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain; [Capellan-Perez, Inigo; Miguel, Luis J.] Univ Valladolid, Syst Engn & Automat Control, Escuela Ingn Ind, Paseo Cauce S-N, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain";"Capellan-Perez, I (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Res Grp Energy Econ & Syst Dynam, Escuela Ingn Ind, Paseo Cauce S-N, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain.; Capellan-Perez, I (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Syst Engn & Automat Control, Escuela Ingn Ind, Paseo Cauce S-N, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain.";inigo.capellan@uva.es;"Alvarez-Antelo, David/AAC-6180-2020; Miguel, Luis J/I-2829-2015; Capellan-Perez, Inigo/H-6069-2015";"Alvarez-Antelo, David/0000-0001-9738-3981; Miguel, Luis J/0000-0002-8243-8596; Capellan-Perez, Inigo/0000-0002-3098-8027";Juan de la Cierva Research Fellowship of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain [FJCI-2016-28833];Inigo Capellan-Perez acknowledges financial support from the Juan de la Cierva Research Fellowship of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain (no.

To test this idea about the value of gamification, college students (n = 64) learned Italian by playing the online language learning game, Duolingo at home for seven sessions, or learned the same material through watching an online slideshow for seven sessions. Although the groups did not differ significantly on achievement posttests, the Duolingo group rated their learning experience as significantly more enjoyable (d = 0.77), more appealing (d = 1.17), and less difficult (d = 0.51), and was significantly more willing to continue with similar learning experiences (d = 1.39). Overall, these results point to the motivational and affective benefits of Duolingo as a promising alternative to more traditional methods for students who may require additional motivation not to disengage from the material.;"[James, Kelsey K.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Psychol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Mayer, Richard E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA";Mayer, RE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.;mayer@psych.ucsb.edu;NA;NA;Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research [N00014162046];Office of Naval Research, Grant/Award Number: N00014162046;NA;24;0;0;4;31;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0888-4080;1099-0720;NA;APPL COGNITIVE PSYCH;Appl.

In this context, gamification is put forward as a solution to achieve this aim. The present study examined the effect of gamification - building on leaderboards - on LP. Furthermore, mediating variables, such as intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, engagement, and background variables, such as sex, previous gaming experience, and undergraduate major, were considered. A pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design with an experimental and a control condition was set up (n = 89) in an Introductory Computer Programming course. We observed a significant improvement in the LP of students in the gamified condition. However, no interaction effect was detected, due to mediating and background variables. The high learning gain is a favorable indicator that gamification might be a promising approach to promote STEM programs.;"[Ortiz-Rojas, Margarita; Valcke, Martin] Univ Ghent, Dept Educ Studies, Ghent, Belgium; [Ortiz-Rojas, Margarita] ESPOL, Ctr Informat Technol, Campus Gustavo Galindo,Km 30-5 Via Perimetral, Guayaquil, Ecuador; [Chiluiza, Katherine] ESPOL, Fac Elect & Comp Engn, Campus Gustavo Galindo,Km 30-5 Via Perimetral, Guayaquil, Ecuador";Ortiz-Rojas, M (corresponding author), ESPOL, Ctr Informat Technol, Campus Gustavo Galindo,Km 30-5 Via Perimetral, Guayaquil, Ecuador.;margarita.ortiz@cti.espol.edu.ec;Ortiz-Rojas, Margarita/V-7329-2017;Ortiz-Rojas, Margarita/0000-0003-2193-8316;NA;NA;NA;73;11;11;7;39;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;NA;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

This article aims at gaining an in-depth understanding of the power of gamification as shaping motivation based on the principles of basic psychological need satisfaction derived from Self-Determination Theory. This study is based on the qualitative analysis of 125 surveys (n = 40) and 2 focus group interviews (n = 7) gained throughout a 15-week university master course in which students voluntary interacted with a gamified platform. The results show the ambivalent motivational power of game elements in technology-supported learning environments-affording feelings of autonomy, competence and relatedness in some cases, thwarting them in others-with situational factors playing an important role in this process. These findings aid in understanding the workings of gamification and might help in explaining the mixed results about the effectiveness of gamification reported in previous literature.

Self-Determination Theory suggests that people situationally appraise the functional significance or psychological meaning of a given stimulus, which can result in different motivational states, but there is little empirical work observing actual functionalisations of game design elements. We therefore conducted a qualitative in-the-wild diary and interview study with 81 university students who reported on their experiences with badges on two popular gamified online learning platforms, Khan Academy and Codecademy. Participants functionalised badges in nine distinct ways that only partially align with prior theory. Functionalisations shaped experience and motivation and prompted function-aligned behaviour. Badge design details fostered but did not determine different functionalisations, while no user or context characteristics were identified that reliably linked to particular functionalisations. We conclude that future research may need to conceptualise game design elements in a more differentiated way to capture what aspects support different motivational functions.;"[van Roy, Rob; Zaman, Bieke] Katholieke Univ Leuven, IMEC, Mintlab, Pk Str 45 Box 3500, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Deterding, Sebastian] Univ York, Digital Creat Labs, Ron Cooke Hub, York YO10 5GE, N Yorkshire, England";van Roy, R (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, IMEC, Mintlab, Pk Str 45 Box 3500, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.;"Rob.vanRoy@kuleuven.be; Sebastian.Deterding@york.ac.uk; Bieke.Zaman@kuleuven.be";NA;NA;"EPSRC/AHRC/InnovateUKUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/M023265/1]; FWOFWO [V419816N]";This work was partly conducted in the Digital Creativity Labs (digitalcreativity.ac.uk), jointly funded by EPSRC/AHRC/InnovateUK [grant number EP/M023265/1] and was further supported by FWO (fwo.be) [grant number V419816N].;NA;100;3;4;2;10;ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;LONDON;24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND;1071-5819;1095-9300;NA;INT J HUM-COMPUT ST;Int.

However, gamefulness is defined imprecisely across the literature. To address this, we present a theory of gamefulness that splits gamefulness into more specific constructs and outlines their effects in a process model. Method: We integrate extant literature from psychology, human-computer interaction, and other fields to define gameful design, systems, and experiences. Most critically, we argue that gameful experience is the core focal construct of this theory and define it as an interactive state occurring when a person perceives non-trivial achievable goals created externally, is motivated to pursue them under an arbitrary set of behavioral rules, and evaluates that motivation as voluntary. Results: We present six resulting propositions: (1) gameful systems lead to gameful experiences, (2) gameful systems impact psychological characteristics, (3) effective gameful design leads to gameful systems, (4) effective gameful systems lead to behavioral change, (5) appropriate behavioral change causes the distal outcomes gamification designers target, and (6) individual differences moderate the effectiveness of gameful systems. Conclusion: Gameful experience theory provides researchers with a unified foundation to study gamification from any social scientific lens.;"[Landers, Richard N.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Tondello, Gustavo F.; Nacke, Lennart E.] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Kappen, Dennis L.] Univ Ontario Inst Technol, Oshawa, ON, Canada; [Collmus, Andrew B.] Old Dominion Univ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Mekler, Elisa D.] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland";Landers, RN (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;rlanders@umn.edu;Mekler, Elisa/L-2887-2018;"Mekler, Elisa/0000-0003-0076-6703; Fortes Tondello, Gustavo/0000-0002-4174-7245; Kappen, Dennis/0000-0003-4815-153X; Landers, Richard/0000-0001-5611-2923";"National Council for Scientific and Technological Development of Brazil (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [RGPIN-2018-06576]; NSERC CREATE SWaGUR; SSHRCSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [895-2011-1014]; CFICanada Foundation for Innovation [35819]";Gustavo Tondello would like to thank the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development of Brazil (CNPq) for his funding while this research was conducted.

Current cognitive training games often overlook the important relationship between cognition and emotion, characterised by 'hot executive function', and correlated with fundamental academic and life outcomes. Here, we present robust qualitative evidence from a case study which documents the social relationships, motivation and engagement of a class of ten-year-old children who used an active smartphone cognitive training game called BrainQuest in their physical education lessons over a period of 5 weeks. Game design elements which are intended to move beyond simple gamification of cognitive tests are presented, along with a discussion of how these design elements worked in practice. The paper also presents and discusses the impact of the game upon the cognitive and emotional regulatory skills, characterised by executive function skills, based on the findings of this initial work.

However, in technological areas such as engineering, where students must carry out hands-on exercises and laboratory work essential for their learning, it is not so easy to design online environments for practicals. The aim of this experimental study was to examine students' acceptance of technology and the process of adopting an online learning environment incorporating web-based resources, such as virtual laboratories, interactive activities, and educational videos, and a game-based learning methodology. To this end, their responses to an online questionnaire (n = 223) were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The study was based on the technology acceptance model (TAM), but included and assessed other factors such as perceived efficiency, playfulness, and satisfaction, which are not explained by the TAM. Our results confirm that this extension of the TAM provides a useful theoretical model to help understand and explain users' acceptance of an online learning environment incorporating virtual laboratory and practical work. Our results also indicate that efficiency, playfulness, and students' degree of satisfaction are factors that positively influence the original TAM variables and students' acceptance of this technology.

The groups were determined by random assignment of 97 pre-service teachers who took scientific research methods course in the 2017-2018 academic year spring semester.

At the beginning and the end of the six-week-long instruction activities, the academic achievement test and student engagement scale on the content instructed in the six-week-long scientific research methods course were applied. Furthermore, in-depth views of pre-service teachers were obtained with focus group interviews. Therefore, the study was conducted with mixed design principles. The study findings demonstrated that the scientific research methods academic achievement x student engagement x group interaction model (Wilks's lambda =.819, F-[2,F- 66] = 7.301, p < 0.05) was significant. The activities gamified with Kahoot application, albeit statistically insignificant, had a more positive impact on academic achievement and student engagement when compared to the other groups. On the other hand, it was observed that the positive impact of the activities gamified with Quizizz application was lower than that of the instruction method utilized in the control group both based on academic achievement (Delta<(X)over bar>(pretest-post-testquitizz) = 38.116, Delta(X) over bar (pretest-post-testcontrol) = 38.776) and student engagement (Delta(X) over bar (pretest-posttestqutzit). = 12.176, ARpretest-postm5 o,01 = 14.218). Opposed to quantitative findings, pre-service teachers expressed views about the problems they experienced under the sub themes of motivation, reinforcement, entertainment, competition sub-themes in gamification activities and stated that they were generally positive about the activities and experienced problems related to the infrastructure and the tool.";"[Goksun, Derya Orhan] Adiyaman Univ, Comp Educ & Instruct Technol Dept, Adiyaman, Turkey; [Gursoy, Gulden] Adiyaman Univ, Sci Educ Dept, Adiyaman, Turkey";Goksun, DO (corresponding author), Adiyaman Univ, Fac Educ, A-56, TR-02100 Adiyaman, Turkey.;"dorhan@adiyaman.edu.tr; gakdag@adiyaman.edu.tr";Goksun, Derya Orhan/AAV-2839-2020;"Goksun, Derya Orhan/0000-0003-0194-0451; GURSOY, Gulden/0000-0002-4886-7645";NA;NA;NA;74;29;30;19;117;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;NA;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

It is a technique to facilitate formative assessment and to promote student learning. It has been shown to be more effective than traditional methods. This phenomenological study was conducted to explore the advantages of gamification through the use of the Kahoot! platform for formative assessment in medical education.MethodsThis study employed a phenomenological design. Five focus groups were conducted with medical students who had participated in several Kahoot! sessions.ResultsThirty-six categories and nine sub-themes emerged from the focus group discussions. They were grouped into three themes: attractive learning tool, learning guidance and source of motivation.ConclusionsThe results suggest that Kahoot! sessions motivate students to study, to determine the subject matter that needs to be studied and to be aware of what they have learned.

To test whether gamification could be used to engage low-motivation smokers, we conceptualized Take a Break - a 3-week technology-assisted challenge for smokers to compete in setting and achieving brief abstinence goals. Materials and Methods: In the feasibility study of the multi-technology Take a Break challenge, low-motivation smokers were given (1) daily motivational messages, (2) brief challenge quizzes related to smoking behaviors, (3) a telehealth call to personalize their abstinence goal for the challenge, (4) coping minigames to help manage cravings while attempting to achieve their brief abstinence goals, and (5) a leaderboard webApp, providing comparative feedback on smokers' participation, and allowing for competition. Heterogeneity of engagement was tracked. Results: All 41 smokers initially reported that they were not actively quitting. Over half were employed less than full time (51%), completed less than a 4-year college education (76%), and experienced financial stress (54%). No smokers opted out of the motivational messages, and mean proportion of response to the challenge quizzes was 0.88 (SD = 0.19). Half of the smokers reported using the coping minigames. Almost all set abstinence goals (78%), with over half lasting 1-2 days (51%); median = 1 day (IQR 1-7). Leaderboard points ranged widely. Conclusions: Rates of smoking in the developed world have declined, and those who remain smokers are complex and have lower motivation to quit.

Thus, efforts such as educational interventions among high-risk populations, especially the youth, are key to increasing public awareness regarding leptospirosis. This paper presents the findings of a pilot study wherein an educational intervention using a gamification intervention method was used to determine changes in leptospirosis knowledge among youth. On this note, students from a public university in Seremban district, Malaysia, were recruited and were asked to complete questionnaires before and after gamification activities. Baseline and immediate post-intervention data on leptospirosis knowledge were obtained. The total knowledge score was calculated, and differences in the mean pre- and post-intervention knowledge score were determined. Of the total 185 questionnaires that were completed at baseline and immediately post-intervention, only 168 that belonged to respondents who had heard of leptospirosis were analysed in this paper. A significant increase in leptospirosis knowledge was observed for the students following health education by gamification (p < 0.01). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of an educational intervention using gamification in improving leptospirosis knowledge among youth and suggest that gamification could become an efficient tool to prevent the disease within university-age demographics.;"[Azhari, Nurul Natasya; Nordin, Syafinaz Amin] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Med Microbiol & Parasitol, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Manaf, Rosliza Abdul] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Community Hlth, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Ng, Shing Wei] Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Biosci, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Ng, Shing Wei] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Vet Med, Dept Vet Clin Studies, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Bajunid, Siti Farhana Shakeeb Arsalaan Bajunid; Saad, Wan Zuhainis] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Biotechnol & Biomol Sci, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Gobil, Abdul Rahman Mohd] Univ Teknol MARA, UiTM Cawangan Negeri Sembilan, Fac Comp & Math Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Kampus Seremban, Seremban 70300, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia; [Nordin, Syafinaz Amin] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Med Educ Res & Innovat Unit, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia";"Nordin, SA (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Med Microbiol & Parasitol, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.; Nordin, SA (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Med Educ Res & Innovat Unit, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.";"natasyazhari99@gmail.com; rosliza_abmanaf@upm.edu.my; shingwei89@gmail.com; farhanabajunid@gmail.com; argobil@uitm.edu.my; zuhainis@upm.edu.my; syafinaz@upm.edu.my";Manaf, Rosliza Abdul/N-2327-2019;"Manaf, Rosliza Abdul/0000-0003-1488-1235; Ng, Shing Wei/0000-0002-3827-3069; Azhari, Nurul natasya/0000-0003-3072-2699; Amin Nordin., Syafinaz/0000-0002-6054-2368";"Malaysia One Health University Network (MyOHUN) [6281500]; Malaysia Ministry of Education [UPM/700-2/1/LRGS/5526400]";This research was funded by Malaysia One Health University Network (MyOHUN), grant number 6281500 and Malaysia Ministry of Education through Long-Term Research Grant Scheme ( UPM/700-2/1/LRGS/5526400).;NA;55;0;0;0;5;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;1660-4601;NA;INT J ENV RES PUB HE;Int.

Likewise, the objective of this study is to present the design and the development of an educational web application for learning the necessary steps towards the detection of bogus content, according to the fact-checking procedures. The game presents news articles, which have to be characterized as fake or real by the players. During the effort to reach the correct decision, the players can use tools and practices for identifying relevant information regarding the clues, which frame a news story (title, date, creator, source, containing images). After presenting the progress of interface design and development, this paper reports the results of a randomized online field study (n = 111), which provides some preliminary evidence.

Gamification is a booming technology based on combining the psychological aspects, mechanics and dynamics of a game in non-ludic environments. The use of gamification has shown good outcomes in terms of increasing students' motivation towards the sciences. In this study, new laboratory practices were developed under the umbrella of gamification methodology for pre-service teachers. The general objectives were to eliminate negative prejudices, fear and rejection attitudes towards science, to foster the conceptual and procedural learning of science among students and to provide students with real-life examples and an experience of applying gamification themselves. First, the theoretical basis of the main components and dynamics of gamification in the Education context are summarized. Secondly, their application in a specific subject from the curriculum for the Teaching Training in Primary Education degree (Didactics of Natural Science (DNS), 3rd year) are presented. The methodology was applied twice in laboratory practice in two consecutive academic years: 2017/2018 (5 groups, 150 students) and 2018/2019 (6 groups, 183 students). The steps, dynamics, components and the tools used for the gamification experience are described (i.e. Kahoot, Class Dojo).

When properly applied in educational settings, gamification can lead to better learning. Furthermore, it can be boosted when tied to social networks. However, according to the literature, there are three main concerns regarding this topic: (a) instructors and teachers does not have the resources to plan and develop gamification strategies into their classes; (b) gamification needs a systematic approach to achieve the desired positive results; and (c) inexistence of systematic approaches that connect and help in the design of gamification and social network tasks within these contexts. Thus, this work proposes a solution to help instructors and teachers to plan and deploy gamification concepts with social network features in learning environments. In this paper, we detailed our approach depicting the set of items to analyze and compare it with other solutions that are focused on education. Then, it was conducted a case study over a programming course (N = 40) to analyze the planning and deployment phases. Our results demonstrated that our approach is the first to consider the stakeholders (i.e. instructors and teachers) as part of the process.

To collect the qualitative data, unstructured observations were undertaken each week. All the qualitative data were analysed via the content analysis method. Then, a scale initially including 26 items was developed based on the observation results and related literature. The quantitative data were gathered using this scale and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was applied to examine the factor structure of the scale. The observation results were categorised under the following six themes: learning effect, expected outcome, competition, entertainment, engagement and intention.

Video games have been introduced as one of the possible new tools for educating the upcoming generation in many different fields. Specifically, construction management education has attempted to use simulation software to introduce students to various construction concepts. However, these simulations have missed the mark when it comes to the fun factor which has affected the uptake and therefore the educational impact of such tools. CONVEX is an educational video game that was developed with the objective of teaching high-level construction management concepts without sacrificing enjoyment. A study was conducted that showed that CONVEX impacted players' ability to recognize construction activity sequence as well as the resources required to complete these activities.

However, creating good gamified designs is effort intensive as it is and tailoring system interactions to each user will only add to this workload. We propose machine learning algorithm -based personalized content selection to address a part of this problem and present a process for creating personalized designs that allows automating a part of the implementation. The process is based on Deterding's 2015 framework for gameful design, the lens of intrinsic skill atoms, with additional steps for selecting a personalization strategy and algorithm creation. We then demonstrate the process by implementing personalized gamification for a computer-supported collaborative learning environment. For this demonstration, we use the gamification user type hexad for personalization and the heuristics for effective design of gamification for overall design. The result of the applied design process is a context-aware, personalized gamification ruleset for collaborative environments.

Utilities, government, and commercial entities offer numerous programs and consumer products to help individuals set or reach goals related to energy use. Many of these interventions and products have related apps that use gamification in some capacity in order to improve the user experience, offer motivation, and encourage behavior change. We identified 57 apps from nearly 2400 screened apps that both target direct energy use and employ at least one element of gamification. We evaluated these apps with specific focus on gamification components, game elements, and behavioral constructs. Our analysis shows that the average energy related app heavily underutilizes search engine optimization, gamification components, and game design elements, as well as the behavioral constructs known to impact energy-related decision-making and behavior.

Gaming, videogames and innovation can be a good way to improve the learning of curricular contents in students. Through this innovative and gamification proposal, Physical Education teachers are offered a didactic adaptation of the successful and famous video game Fortnite, a video game that has attracted the attention of millions of players around the world, especially children and adolescents. A new sports game called Fortnite EF is created for this purpose. Its objective is to work on different contents of the primary and secondary education curriculum, boosting motivation and enjoyment in sports practice, preventing violent behaviour and working on different values. It presents the complete development of the didactic proposal and develops a methodological approach to research based on the collection of data through questionnaires passed on to future university teachers. The results confirm a greater motivation towards the practice of sport, a better work of values and prevention of violent behaviours during the game as well as an innovative way of working different contents of the curriculum through a new sport game, being defined by the participants in the study as very intense, dynamic, fun and stimulating as well as affirming close to 95% of those surveyed that it is a fast game, full of stimuli and with a high level of motor commitment.;[Arufe Giraldez, Victor] Univ A Coruna, Fac Educ, Unidad Invest Deporte Escolar Educ Fis & Psicomot, La Coruna, Spain;Giraldez, VA (corresponding author), Univ A Coruna, Fac Educ, Unidad Invest Deporte Escolar Educ Fis & Psicomot, La Coruna, Spain.;v.arufe@udc.es;Arufe-Giraldez, Victor/AAT-8156-2020;Arufe-Giraldez, Victor/0000-0002-6440-048X;NA;NA;NA;26;3;3;4;39;UNIV CORUNA, SERVICIO PUBLICACIONS;CORUNA;CAMPUS DE ELVINA, CORUNA, 15071, SPAIN;2386-8333;NA;NA;SPORTIS;Sportis;MAY;2019;5;2;NA;NA;NA;NA;323;349;NA;10.17979/sportis.2019.5.2.5257;NA;NA;27;Education & Educational Research;Education & Educational Research;HW2JD;WOS:000466508500010;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Background: The family nurse practitioner program uses graduate Health Education Systems Incorporated examination as a quality indicator and program benchmark. A downward trend in Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores stimulated a need for change. Two strategies were implemented to enhance engagement and improve synthesis of clinical information. Case-based learning and gamification involves the use of game thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts to engage users in solving problems while the case-based discussions act as formative assessment tool, providing information on student's progress and development. Objectives: To assess the implementation of innovative strategies on the Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores and to enhance students engagement and synthesis of clinical information. Method: Case presentations were created in the Learning Management System an online program, for every module. Interwoven throughout the module are various game elements. The game elements include voluntary participation with immediate feedback that can be both positive and negative and provides a social connection. The student has the freedom to fail and the freedom to choose without significant repercussions. Results: The results showed examination scores increased significantly. Using a one-way analysis of variance to compare Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores between semester cohorts of students, followed by a post hoc pairwise comparison a statistically significant difference (p < .001) between previous semesters was identified. Conclusion: Although there are many approaches for online learning, using case presentations can mirror different social and cultural situations to challenge the learner. Case-based discussion and gamification strategies are effective in engaging students in a challenging environment. Student responded positively to case-base presentation with game elements. Using this approach is designed to challenge and add value to the learning experience.;"[Mackavey, Carole] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Family Hlth, Family Nurse Practitioner Track, 6901 Benner Ave, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Cron, Stan] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, 6901 Bertner Ave, Houston, TX 77030 USA";Mackavey, C (corresponding author), Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Family Hlth, Family Nurse Practitioner Track, 6901 Benner Ave, Houston, TX 77030 USA.;"Carole.L.Mackavey@uth.tmc.edu; Stanley.Cron@uth.tmc.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;17;5;5;3;15;CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE;EDINBURGH;JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND;0260-6917;1532-2793;NA;NURS EDUC TODAY;Nurse Educ.

Two focus groups (FGs) of children aged 10-12 years were formed, for the design, development, and evaluation of educational tools for gamification techniques on the subject of sustainable mobility. The study involved a group of children from three classes in the fifth-year of primary education at a school in the City of Burgos (Spain). The first focus group revealed the cognitive perceptions of the children toward sustainable mobility and their cognitive understanding of its need. The information was used in the design of learning activities of gamification techniques. The children in the second focus group, after the educational experience, were evaluated with regard to the knowledge they had acquired on the topic and changes in their attitudes. The basic knowledge of children before their participation in the research was limited to the environmental aspects of sustainable mobility, as we observed in the first focus group. Through the use of the gamification tools, the children acquired new concepts that clarified the importance of social and economic components linked to sustainable mobility, and they started to develop an awareness of how to play an active role in changing their behavior.;"[Sipone, Silvia; Abella-Garcia, Victor] Univ Burgos, Dept Educ Sci, Burgos 09001, Spain; [Barreda, Rosa] Univ Cantabria, Dept Transportat & Project Technol & Proc, E-39005 Santander, Spain; [Rojo, Marta] Univ Burgos, Dept Civil Engn, Burgos 09001, Spain";Sipone, S (corresponding author), Univ Burgos, Dept Educ Sci, Burgos 09001, Spain.;"ssx1003@alu.ubu.es; vabella@ubu.es; barredamr@gmail.es; mrarce@ubu.es";"Rojo, Marta/A-9998-2013; Abella, Victor/O-5260-2016";"Rojo, Marta/0000-0003-4747-4433; Abella, Victor/0000-0001-9406-9313; Sipone, Silvia/0000-0003-3355-9217";Ministero dell'Istruzione dell'Universita e della Ricerca of the Italian Government;We would like to thank the Ministero dell'Istruzione dell'Universita e della Ricerca of the Italian Government for funding the PhD studies of Silvia Sipone in the University of Burgos (Spain).;NA;38;3;3;2;7;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2071-1050;NA;NA;SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL;Sustainability;APR 2;2019;11;8;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2387;10.3390/su11082387;NA;NA;15;"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies";"Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology";HX9TU;WOS:000467752200200;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Part of its appeal is in developing autonomy in the player, and part of its appeal is in participating regularly in a structured progress ladder where the customer, student, or employee can predict how present actions can lead to future rewards. Currently, research in applying gamification to undergraduate courses is sparse, which is surprising given the overlap between higher education and game design; students and players both follow rules, participate voluntarily, engage with a feedback loop, and work toward a goal. This study applied game design principles via gamification to an undergraduate General Psychology course at a community college. Results indicate better motivation, improved exam scores, a stronger sense of autonomy, and a desire within students to have more courses offered in this manner.

Based on continued research, however, the badge began to be recognized as a scale to measure the learner's knowledge and skill and an important means of helping learners to gradually build intrinsic motivation by using certain extrinsic motivators. As the badge's value has grown, the importance of its design has garnered attention. Objective: The objective of this research was to establish a badge design framework that can be used in a gamified learning environment. Methods: Data were collected from previous studies on badge design, 943 badge cases were extracted from 11 online and offline gamification in education contents, and their patterns and features were analyzed. Results: Based on the analysis of results from previous studies and 943 collected badge cases, our study suggests three conditions for badge design. Through the literature review and collected badge cases, our study designed a badge design framework. First, it is necessary to distinguish whether the type of learning activity required for earning badges is physical or conceptual. Second, it is necessary to distinguish whether the scale of an activity required for earning badges requires individual learning or interaction-induced learning. Third, it is important to review whether the time and effort invested in earning badges is simple, repetitive, and short-term or continuous and long-term. Based on these three conditions, collected badge cases were analyzed. To verify self-developed badge types, we conducted a chi-square test on the collected cases and confirmed that there was a significant difference for each of the eight badge types (Pearson chi-square 1117.7, P<.001). Conclusions: Through its literature review on previous studies, this study demonstrated the badge's educational effectiveness. The badge design framework suggested in our study is expected to resolve some of the difficulties experienced during the badge design process in a gamified learning environment, encourage efficient badge design, and maximize learning effect.;"[Park, Sungjin; Kim, Sangkyun] Kangwon Natl Univ, Management Technol Lab, 417,Engn Bldg 1,Kangwon Daehak GIl 1, Chunchon, South Korea";Kim, S (corresponding author), Kangwon Natl Univ, Management Technol Lab, 417,Engn Bldg 1,Kangwon Daehak GIl 1, Chunchon, South Korea.;saviour@kangwon.ac.kr;NA;Park, Sungjin/0000-0002-0121-4022;"National Research Foundation of Korea grantNational Research Foundation of Korea; Korean Government (Ministry of Science and ICT) [2017R1A2B2002798]";"This study was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea grant and funded by the Korean Government (Ministry of Science and ICT; #2017R1A2B2002798).";NA;29;2;2;2;10;JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC;TORONTO;59 WINNERS CIRCLE, TORONTO, ON M4L 3Y7, CANADA;2291-9279;NA;NA;JMIR SERIOUS GAMES;JMIR Serious Games;APR-JUN;2019;7;2;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;e14342;10.2196/14342;NA;NA;17;"Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Medical Informatics";"Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Medical Informatics";II0OF;WOS:000474904300006;31144664;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Still, many sub-Saharan African educators continue to confine these platforms to recreational activities. There is lack therefore of knowledge about how learners from sub-Saharan Africa perform such informal and experiential learning. This paper presents a case study of Tanzanian learners learning in informal settings using their mobile devices and MIMs. It deploys the rhizomatic learning theory with the aim of understanding how such learning occurs. Findings suggest that learners use mobile devices and MIMs to organize their personal learning spaces, to access specific content and to interact with peers on academic topics. Mobile devices and their MIMs are used as support in personal learning environments understood as multidimensional networks of heterogeneous multiplicities which rhizomatic maps situate, and contain knowledge, skills, and opportunities for innovation.;"[Bagui, Laban; Mwapwele, Samwel Dick] Univ Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa";Bagui, L (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa.;"labanbagui@gmail.com; samwel.mwapwele@hotmail.com";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;63;0;0;0;5;KENNESAW STATE UNIV;KENNESAW;1000 CHASTAIN RD, KENNESAW, GA 30144 USA;1936-0282;NA;NA;AFR J INF SYST;Afr.

The authors propose a framework to assess gamified environments, identify and adopt gamification principles, as well as design gamified activities. The proposed framework helps users create gamified experiences that satisfy the purposes, goals, principles, and elements defined as fundamental gamification components. Here, the authors apply the proposed framework to a video scrum simulation to assess the adoption of gamification principles. The case study includes identification of gamification principles incorporated in the video scrum and their relationships to the elements of the mechanics, dynamics, and emotions framework.

The current SGs for SPM have a quite specific scope, are not able to provide and dynamically change game scenarios during the life of the SG and do not allow teachers to assess students' new skills automatically. These weaknesses led to the development of ProDec, a simulation-based SG that is able to incorporate SPM real-life practice. In this study, the authors discuss the use of SGs in SPM education before they describe ProDecAdmin, the game scenario design tool for ProDec. ProDecAdmin provides teachers with an environment for designing the game scenarios for ProDec. Additionally, it helps teachers establish the assessment criteria to automate the students' assessment during the game plays. These functionalities allow ProDec to offer students any game scenario that teachers design and to assess their performance in them. Hence, the tool ProDecAdmin helps the SG ProDec to overcome the lack of flexibility and automatic assessment identified in the current SGs for SPM.

Gamification refers to designing information systems to afford similar experiences and motivations as games do, and consequently, attempting to affect user behavior. In recent years, popularity of gamification has skyrocketed and manifested in growing numbers of gamified applications, as well as a rapidly increasing amount of research. However, this vein of research has mainly advanced without an agenda, theoretical guidance or a clear picture of the field. To make the picture more coherent, we provide a comprehensive review of the gamification research (N = 819 studies) and analyze the research models and results in empirical studies on gamification. While the results in general lean towards positive findings about the effectiveness of gamification, the amount of mixed results is remarkable. Furthermore, education, health and crowdsourcing as well as points, badges and leader-boards persist as the most common contexts and ways of implementing gamification. Concurrently, gamification research still lacks coherence in research models, and a consistency in the variables and theoretical foundations. As a final contribution of the review, we provide a comprehensive discussion, consisting of 15 future research trajectories, on future agenda for the growing vein of literature on gamification and gameful systems within the information system science field.;"[Koivisto, Jonna; Hamari, Juho] Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun, Gamificat Grp, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland; [Hamari, Juho] Univ Turku, Fac Humanities, Gamificat Grp, Turku, Finland";Koivisto, J (corresponding author), Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun, Gamificat Grp, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland.;jonna.koivisto@tut.fi;"Hamari, Juho/AAC-3528-2020; Hamari, Juho/E-4989-2016";"Hamari, Juho/0000-0002-6573-588X; Hamari, Juho/0000-0002-6573-588X";"Business Finland [5479/31/2017, 40111/14, 40107/14, 40009/16]; Academy of Finland (Center of Excellence - GameCult); Satakunnan korkeakoulusaatio";This work has been supported by the Business Finland (5479/31/2017, 40111/14, 40107/14 and 40009/16) and participating partners, Satakunnan korkeakoulusaatio and its collaborators, and Academy of Finland (Center of Excellence - GameCult).;NA;140;125;127;44;136;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;0268-4012;1873-4707;NA;INT J INFORM MANAGE;Int.

Based on the proposed model, we detail the design of a technology-enhanced learning experience in which a series of traditional lessons are enriched by collaborative work on interactive tabletops; four gameful activities are used which may be directly linked to a school curriculum. We conduct a qualitative case study with the participation of 86 fifth grade students across two elementary schools which have a significant minority enrolment. We demonstrate the ways in which the students draw on recently-acquired knowledge, engage in dramatic play, share the digital space and collaborate intensively to achieve a new and refined understanding of concepts and behaviours linked to perspective-taking. We discuss how tabletops, in synergy with constructivist pedagogy and principles of gameful design, allow researchers and practitioners to promote communication, collaboration and perspective-taking in ways that were hitherto difficult to enact in traditional lessons. Gameful design for learning is seen as a multilevel endeavour, which involves the selection of tasks and tools as well as the behaviour of the learners and the instructor as participants in the learning environment.";[Ioannou, Andri] Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Multimedia & Graph Arts, Cyprus Interact Lab, 30 Archbishop Kyprianou Str, CY-3036 Lemesos, Cyprus;Ioannou, A (corresponding author), Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Multimedia & Graph Arts, Cyprus Interact Lab, 30 Archbishop Kyprianou Str, CY-3036 Lemesos, Cyprus.;andri.i.ioannou@cut.ac.cy;"Zaphiris, Panayiotis/O-8093-2019; Ioannou, Andri/S-5102-2017";"Zaphiris, Panayiotis/0000-0001-8112-5099; Ioannou, Andri/0000-0002-3570-6578";"European Union's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme through the NOTRE Project (H2020-TWINN-2015) [692058];  [YE/YA/SALE/02.2015-2016]";Authors acknowledge funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme through the NOTRE Project (H2020-TWINN-2015, Grant Agreement Number: 692058) as well as funding from Project (YE/YA/SALE/02.2015-2016) awarded to the Limassol municipality and other local authorities in Cyprus.;NA;60;9;9;3;24;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1042-1629;1556-6501;NA;ETR&D-EDUC TECH RES;ETR&D-Educ.

Serious gaming and gamification education have the potential to provide a quality, cost-effective, novel approach that is flexible, portable, and enjoyable and allow interaction with tutors and peers. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of serious gaming/gamification for health professions education compared with traditional learning, other types of digital education, or other serious gaming/gamification interventions in terms of patient outcomes, knowledge, skills, professional attitudes, and satisfaction (primary outcomes) as well as economic outcomes of education and adverse events (secondary outcomes). Methods: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, Educational Resources Information Centre, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature was conducted from 1990 to August 2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently searched, screened, and assessed the study quality and extracted data. A meta-analysis was not deemed appropriate due to the heterogeneity of populations, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes. Therefore, a narrative synthesis is presented. Results: A total of 27 RCTs and 3 cluster RCTs with 3634 participants were included. Two studies evaluated gamification interventions, and the remaining evaluated serious gaming interventions. One study reported a small statistically significant difference between serious gaming and digital education of primary care physicians in the time to control blood pressure in a subgroup of their patients already taking antihypertensive medications. There was evidence of a moderate-to-large magnitude of effect from five studies evaluating individually delivered interventions for objectively measured knowledge compared with traditional learning. There was also evidence of a small-to-large magnitude of effect from 10 studies for improved skills compared with traditional learning. Two and four studies suggested equivalence between interventions and controls for knowledge and skills, respectively. Evidence suggested that serious gaming was at least as effective as other digital education modalities for these outcomes. There was insufficient evidence to conclude whether one type of serious gaming/gamification intervention is more effective than any other. There was limited evidence for the effects of serious gaming/gamification on professional attitudes. Serious gaming/gamification may improve satisfaction, but the evidence was limited. Evidence was of low or very low quality for all outcomes. Quality of evidence was downgraded due to the imprecision, inconsistency, and limitations of the study. Conclusions: Serious gaming/gamification appears to be at least as effective as controls, and in many studies, more effective for improving knowledge, skills, and satisfaction. However, the available evidence is mostly of low quality and calls for further rigorous, theory-driven research.;"[Gentry, Sarah Victoria] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Gentry, Sarah Victoria] Imperial Coll London, Dept Primary Care & Publ Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth, London, England; [Gauthier, Andrea] Univ Toronto, Inst Med Sci, Fac Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ehrstrom, Beatrice L'Estrade; Lilienthal, Anneliese; Zary, Nabil] Karolinska Inst, Dept Learning Informat Management & Eth, Stockholm, Sweden; [Wortley, David] Royal Soc Arts, London, England; [Car, Lorainne Tudor] Nanyang Technol Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Med, Family Med & Primary Care, Singapore, Singapore; [Dauwels-Okutsu, Shoko; Car, Josip] Nanyang Technol Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Med, Ctr Populat Hlth Sci, Singapore, Singapore; [Nikolaou, Charoula K.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Philosophie Droit Cellule Biogov, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Zary, Nabil] Nanyang Technol Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Med, Games Hlth Innovat Ctr, Singapore, Singapore; [Zary, Nabil] Mohammed VI Univ Hlth Sci, Emerging Technol Lab, Casablanca, Morocco; [Campbell, James] WHO, Hlth Workforce Dept, Geneva, Switzerland";Gentry, SV (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.;sarah.gentry@doctors.org.uk;"Car, Josip/H-6755-2015; Zary, Nabil/M-9432-2019; Car, Lorainne Tudor/E-1205-2017";"Car, Josip/0000-0001-8969-371X; Tudor Car, Lorainne/0000-0001-8414-7664; Gauthier, Andrea/0000-0002-0059-8685; Zary, Nabil/0000-0001-8999-6999; Gentry, Sarah/0000-0002-0805-0200";Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University Singapore, Singapore (e-learning for health professionals' education grant);This review was conducted in collaboration with the Health Workforce Department at the World Health Organization (WHO).

More specifically, this paper focuses on gamification, considers the needs of all learners, including those who identify as disabled, and raises important inquiries about equity and access to technological instructional materials. Design/methodology/approach Juxtaposing Kapp's (2012) nine elements of gamification with aspects of accessibility, this paper conceptualizes the challenges and possibilities associated with gamified instructional approaches. Findings This paper examines gamification in light of potential barriers that exist as disabled learners navigate online courses that include one or more of the following aspects of gamification - game-based, mechanics, aesthetics, game-thinking, engage, people, motivate action, promote learning, and solve problems. Notably, online courses enhanced with gamification elements present potential access barriers and challenges to learners who identify with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, or visual disabilities. Originality/value In addition to socio-economic factors that may preclude one from engaging in a digital play, there is a larger question of how, if at all, gamification is accessible to learners with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, or visual disabilities or impairments. This paper raises important questions for educators, education researchers, and game and instructional designers alike to ensure ubiquitous access to gamified digital materials in general, and online, gamified materials in particular.;"[Smith, Keyonda] Maryland Univ Integrat Hlth, Ctr Teaching & Learning, Laurel, MD 20723 USA; [Abrams, Sandra Schamroth] St Johns Univ, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, New York, NY USA";Smith, K (corresponding author), Maryland Univ Integrat Hlth, Ctr Teaching & Learning, Laurel, MD 20723 USA.;kmsmithphd@gmail.com;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;79;3;3;3;23;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2056-4880;NA;NA;INT J INF LEARN TECH;Int.

In domains such as education, marketing and health, where gamification techniques are applied, user engagement in applications has increased. In these applications the protection of users' privacy is an important aspect to consider, due to the applications obtaining a record of the personal information of their users. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to identify if applications where gamification is applied do respect users' privacy. For the accomplishment of this aim, two main steps have been implemented. Since the main principle of gamification is the existence of game elements, the first step was to identify the set of game elements recorded in the literature that are commonly applied in various applications. Afterwards, an examination of the relationship between these elements and privacy requirements was implemented in order to identify which elements conflict with the privacy requirements leading to potential privacy violations and which elements do not. Alpha conceptual model according to the results of this examination was designed, which presents how elements conflict with requirements. Based on the results, there are indeed game elements which can lead to privacy violations. The results of this work provide valuable guidance to software developers, especially during the design stages of gamified applications since it helps them to consider the protection of users' privacy in parallel from the early stages of the application development onwards.;"[Mavroeidi, Aikaterini-Georgia; Kitsiou, Angeliki; Kalloniatis, Christos] Univ Aegean, Dept Cultural Technol & Commun, Privacy Engn & Social Informat Lab, Lesvos 81100, Greece; [Gritzalis, Stefanos] Univ Aegean, Dept Informat & Commun Syst Engn, Informat & Commun Syst Secur Lab, Samos 83100, Greece";Kalloniatis, C (corresponding author), Univ Aegean, Dept Cultural Technol & Commun, Privacy Engn & Social Informat Lab, Lesvos 81100, Greece.;"kmav@aegean.gr; a.kitsiou@aegean.gr; chkallon@aegean.gr; sgritz@aegean.gr";Kalloniatis, Christos/AAG-4372-2020;"Kalloniatis, Christos/0000-0002-8844-2596; KITSIOU, ANGELIKI/0000-0003-4809-2429; Gritzalis, Stefanos/0000-0002-8037-2191";NA;NA;NA;57;4;4;0;3;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;1999-5903;NA;NA;FUTURE INTERNET;Future Internet;mar/07;2019;11;3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;67;10.3390/fi11030067;NA;NA;17;Computer Science, Information Systems;Computer Science;HT0SM;WOS:000464274900002;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

In the future, it is expected that gamification will overtake the traditional way of learning resulting in issues such as scalability, upgradation of learning modules. To address these issues, merging gamification with cloud computing seems a viable solution. However, the employability of gamification through cloud computing is still in its infant stage. Hence, this article investigates the applicability of gamification through cloud computing and presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art gamification in education and learning. We also identify the subject areas that can be gamified and taught using the cloud service. The critical elements and minimum requirements necessary to gamify education are also identified. Moreover, a specific cloud assisted gamification architecture is proposed and discussed together with its possible applications. The article is concluded with the research challenges and suggestions for future work. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The available data of German medical faculties indicate that digital teaching concepts currently play a subordinate role in medicine in general and specifically in otorhinolaryngology. By assessing data of our own institution, we could demonstrate that the majority of medical students refer mainly to material handed out by the lecturers as single source of information for learning Otorhinolaryngology. Therefore, the application of sound digital teaching strategies provides special chances, in particular in otorhinolaryngology to cope with the excessive amount of online information from partly unclear sources. Currently, the possible degree of digital teaching reaches from digital service supply via punctual provision of classic teaching concepts and blended learning up to completely digital curricula. The attractiveness of curricular integration of digital teaching strategies is less based on the utilization of merely technological progress, but rather on the variety of applying innovative curricula and new didactic concepts. Depending on the intended teaching purpose, the flipped classroom and the virtual reality seem to have a particularly high potential, while mobile learning is already established in individual practice. Testing and evaluating digital teaching innovations for concrete scenarios currently belongs to the most important scientific challenges of digital teaching concepts. Today, the nationwide implementation of digital teaching in Germany is less impeded by technical conditions, but by missing financing because sponsoring is currently mainly performed with reference to concrete projects; in the context of permanent implementation, however, regular costs arise. To support these promising teaching concepts, the sponsoring of institutions for digital teaching with provision of hard-and software solutions at universities could contribute significantly. Establishing cooperation to use such digital platforms might lead to a high efficiency regarding the distribution with simultaneously profiting of savings potential.";"[Dombrowski, Tobias; Dazert, Stefan; Volkenstein, Stefan] Ruhr Univ Bochum, St Elisabeth Hosp, Klin Hals Nasen Ohrenheilkunde Kopf & Halschirurg, Bochum, Germany";Dombrowski, T (corresponding author), St Elizabeth Hosp, Univ HNO Klin, Bleichstr 15, D-44787 Bochum, Germany.;tobias.dombrowski@rub.de;Volkenstein, Stefan/AAD-2719-2019;NA;NA;NA;NA;81;3;3;3;13;GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG;STUTTGART;RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY;0935-8943;1438-8685;NA;LARYNGO RHINO OTOL;Laryngo-Rhino-Otol.;MAR;2019;98;NA;NA;1;NA;NA;S197;S208;NA;10.1055/a-0803-0218;NA;NA;12;Otorhinolaryngology;Otorhinolaryngology;IA3YE;WOS:000469498300008;31096299;Other Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

The course teaches Unified Modelling Language (UML) and its application in the Unified Process for software development. In this paper, the gamified course metamodel is presented, and it specifies a level-based course structure as well as other gamification elements used in the course, such as points and other types of rewards (coins, items, and badges), the leaderboard, content locking and trading. The gamified course was implemented on Moodle platform, and the experiment was carried out during spring semester 2018. The analysis of students' grades confirms the hypothesis which states that students' grades can increase as a result of applying gamification to their learning process. The results of students' questionnaire (based on the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory scale) also confirm the hypothesis which states that gamification can improve students' motivation.;"[Jurgelaitis, Mantas; Ceponiene, Lina; Ceponis, Jonas; Drungilas, Vaidotas] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Informat, Studentu Str 50, LT-51368 Kaunas, Lithuania";Ceponiene, L (corresponding author), Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Informat, Studentu Str 50, LT-51368 Kaunas, Lithuania.;lina.ceponiene@ktu.lt;"Jurgelaitis, Mantas/AAH-2442-2019; Ceponiene, Lina/R-2365-2019";"Jurgelaitis, Mantas/0000-0003-2221-0765; Ceponiene, Lina/0000-0002-6812-0215";NA;NA;NA;31;12;12;7;46;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;NA;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

Design: Quasi-experimental. Setting: Thirty-seven kindergartens from Portugal. Participants: Eight hundred seventy-seven families. Intervention: Web-based social network of participants' interactions, educational materials, apps and nutritional challenges, focused on fruit, vegetables, sugar, and salt. Main Outcome Measures: Parental nutrition literacy (self-reported survey - 4 dimensions: Nutrients, Food portions, Portuguese food wheel groups, Food labeling). Analysis: General linear model - Repeated measures was used to analyze the effect on the nutrition literacy score. Results: Families uploaded 1267 items (recipes, photographs of challenges) and educators uploaded 327 items (photographs, videos) onto the interactive platform. For the intervention group (n = 106), the final mean (SD) score of nutrition literacy was significantly higher than the baseline: 78.8% (15.6) vs 72.7% (16.2); P < .001, regardless of parental education and perceived income status. No significant differences in the scores of the control group (n = 83) were observed (final 67.8% [16.1] vs initial 66.4% [15.6]; P = .364). Conclusions and Implications: Gamified digital interactive platform seems to be a useful, easily adapted educational tool for the healthy eating learning process.

Traditional medical curricula rely primarily on clerkships during the clinical period of study to train clinical skills, while the preclinical period is mainly used to teach the basic sciences. In recent years, the early introduction of clinical skills training has received increased attention. This review aims to identify and summarize teaching approaches of clinical skills for medical students during preclinical years, namely, (1) framing objectives (2) learning activities, and (3) evaluation strategies. Although the clinical tutor's role is to ensure that students receive effective preclinical skills through different modes of learning (lectures, presentations, and problem-based learning), the role of advanced technologies, namely, simulation-based learning platforms and gamification are found to be very successful. To improve the communication skills, there is strong evidence in support of role plays, and similarly, for enhancing observation skills, an introduction of fine arts in clinical skills training was found to be very useful. Medical schools worldwide should give high priority to conduct faculty development programs on various aspects of training and teaching modalities, evaluation strategies, and improving the evaluation of various clinical skills. Students should be provided with sufficient learning opportunities including a well-equipped clinical skills laboratory and individual attention, and constructive feedback should be given to students for building their confidence level during their learning process.;"[Sahu, Pradeep Kumar] Univ West Indies, Fac Med Sci, Ctr Med Sci Educ, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Chattu, Vijay Kumar] Univ West Indies, Fac Med Sci, Dept Paraclin Sci, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Sakhamuri, Sateesh] Univ West Indies, Fac Med Sci, Dept Clin Med Sci, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Rewatkar, Aishwarya] NKP Salve Inst Med Sci, Dept Biochem, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India";Chattu, VK (corresponding author), Univ West Indies, Fac Med Sci, Dept Paraclin Sci, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago.;drvkumar.ch@gmail.com;Chattu, Vijay Kumar/C-2778-2014;"Chattu, Vijay Kumar/0000-0001-9840-8335; Sahu, Pradeep/0000-0001-7910-9399";NA;NA;NA;61;5;6;1;1;WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS;MUMBAI;WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, 400059, INDIA;2277-9531;2319-6440;NA;J EDUC HEALTH PROMOT;J.

E-learning exercises containing implemented adaptive elements were created in accordance with the Bloom's Taxonomy. Within the pilot study the authors detected high percentage success rate during e-learning exercise completion. This leads to formulation of the question Can any e-learning exercise of lower cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy be skipped without affecting the cognitive thinking for solution of the e-learning exercises on upper cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy? To answer the question, the algorithm of adaptive e-learning was defined and hypotheses were established. The research was carried out as pedagogical experiment comparing the results of both experimental and control groups of pupils. The research hypotheses were confirmed by statistical analysis of the research data. The results confirm that adaptive features of e-learning can be implemented in the primary education. The research results confirm the fact that educational objectives can be achieved with some pupils more effectively. Consequently, the implementation of adaptive elements into e-learning at the primary school supports an individual approach when completing e-learning exercises according to the principle of cognitive computing.;"[Hubalovsky, S.; Musilek, M.] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Sci, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic; [Hubalovska, M.] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Educ, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic";Hubalovsky, S (corresponding author), Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Sci, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic.;stepan.hubalovsky@uhk.ez;NA;NA;Specific research project of Faculty of Education University of Hradec Kralove, and Specific research project of Faculty of Science, University of Hradec Kralove;The research was supported by Specific research project of Faculty of Education University of Hradec Kralove, and Specific research project of Faculty of Science, University of Hradec Kralove.;NA;40;20;20;9;76;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0747-5632;1873-7692;NA;COMPUT HUM BEHAV;Comput.

Likewise, health professionals' beliefs affect their advice and attitudes towards patients' treatment, becoming a possible cause of greater disability. The development of educational interventions based on the best scientific evidence in neurophysiology of pain could be a way to provide information and advice to primary care health professionals to change their cognition towards chronic non-specific low back pain. The use of Information and Communication Technologies allows the development of web sites, which might be one of the effective resources to modify misbeliefs and attitudes, in relation to the origin and meaning of non-specific chronic low back pain, of primary care professionals and that may modify their attitudes in patients' treatment.MethodsThe aim of this project is to identify misbeliefs and attitudes of primary care physicians and nurses about chronic non-specific low back pain to develop a web-based educational tool using different educational formats and gamification techniques. This study has a mixed-method sequential exploratory design. The participants are medical and nursing staff working in primary care centers in the city of Lleida, Spain. For the qualitative phase of this study, the authors will use personal semi-structured interviews. For the quantitative phase the authors will use an experimental study design. Subjects will be randomly allocated using a simple random sample technique. The intervention group will have access to the web site where they will find information related to non-specific chronic low back pain, based on the information obtained in the qualitative phase. The control group will have access to a video explaining the clinical practice guidelines on low back pain.DiscussionThis study has been designed to explore and modify the beliefs and attitudes about chronic low back pain of physicians and nurses working in primary care settings, using a web-based educational tool with different educational formats and gamification techniques. The aim of the educational intervention is to change their knowledge about the origin and meaning of pain, with the result of reducing their misbeliefs and attitudes of fear avoidance.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02962817.

In an effort to prevent medical errors, reporting systems serve as invaluable tools to detect patient safety events and quality problems longitudinally. Historically, trainees (i.e., students and residents) rarely submit incident reports for encountered patient safety threats. The authors propose an immersive learning experience utilizing gamification theory and leveraging the increasingly popular 'escape room' to help resident trainees identify reportable patient safety priorities. All 130 incoming intern physicians at the Thomas Jefferson University (Jefferson) were enrolled in the Patient Safety Escape Room study as part of their residency orientation (June 2018). The residents were randomly divided into 16 teams. Each team was immersed in a simulated escape room, tasked with identifying a predetermined set of serious patient safety hazards, and successfully manually entering them into the Jefferson Event Reporting System within the time allotted to successfully 'win the game' by 'escaping the room'. Quick response (QR) codes were planted throughout the activity to provide in-game instructions; clues to solve the puzzle; and key information about patient safety priorities at Jefferson. All participants underwent a formal debriefing using the feedback capture grid method and completed a voluntary post-study survey, adapted from Brookfield's Critical Incident Questionnaire (CIQ). The study was IRB exempt. Thematic analysis of the post-activity CIQ survey (n = 102) revealed that interns were engaged during the immersive learning experience (n = 42) and were specifically engaged by having to independently identify patient safety threats (n = 30). Participants identified team role assignment (n = 52) and effective communication (n = 26) as the two most helpful actions needed to successfully complete the activity. Participants were overall surprised by the success of the education innovation (n = 45) and reported that it changed how they viewed patient safety threats. Areas for improvement include clearer game instructions and using a more streamlined event reporting process. The escape room patient-safety activity allowed interns to actively engage in an innovative orientation activity that highlighted the importance of patient safety hazards, as well as providing them with the opportunity to document event reports in real-time. Next steps will include longitudinally tracking the quantity of error reports entered by this cohort to determine the effectiveness of this educational intervention.";"[Zhang, Xiao Chi; Papanagnou, Dimitrios] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Emergency Med, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Diemer, Gretchen] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Sidney Kimmel Med Coll, Med, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Lee, Hyunjoo] Stony Brook Univ Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Stony Brook, NY USA; [Jaffe, Rebecca] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Hosp Med, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA";Zhang, XC (corresponding author), Thomas Jefferson Univ, Emergency Med, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.;xzhang09@gmail.com;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;17;4;4;0;9;CUREUS INC;PALO ALTO;PO BOX 61002, PALO ALTO, CA 94306 USA;NA;2168-8184;NA;CUREUS;Cureus;FEB 5;2019;11;2;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;e4014;10.7759/cureus.4014;NA;NA;11;Medicine, General & Internal;General & Internal Medicine;HP2TU;WOS:000461529100001;31007972;Green Published, Other Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Most studies see gamification as a way of introducing gameful design (e.g., competition and social activity) into behavioural interventions. Gamification is often tied to using new digital technologies, especially smartphone apps and, although these might be enabling, there is no theoretical underpinning for making this a necessary condition. In comparison to other sectors, the design of gameful interventions in transport is under developed. Interventions that have or are introducing gamified designs include road safety and travel demand management initiatives and these have been shown to be more ongoingly successful than strategies which do not employ gameful designs. This paper explores gamification in the context of transport with the aim of proposing a framework for the design and implementation of gameful designs, providing a synthesis and critical appraisal of current practice. The proposed framework is underpinned by theoretical discussion and illustrated by case studies that have implemented some elements of gameful design.

For anesthesiology residents, an assortment of challenges has been identified in learning UGRA skills. Currently, a validated UGRA curriculum for residents does not exist, and the level of UGRA proficiency achieved during residency training can vary considerably. Simulated practice has been shown to enhance proficiency in UGRA, and a competency-based education with simulation training has been endorsed for anesthesiology residents. The objective of this review is to outline simulation-based training that can be implemented in a UGRA curriculum and to explore educational tools like gamification to facilitate competency in regional anesthesiology.;"[Kim, T.

This paper presents a mixed methods study using a gamification approach to promote student engagement in online discussions. A total of 70 students were enrolled in this study from an asynchronous online undergraduate level political science course. The study findings suggested that the gamification approach only had positive effects on the students' number of comments and performance in online discussions who were more aware of the gamification approach. However, it appears that the gamification approach failed in promoting students' sense of community. Additionally, students' responses to the interviews and open-ended questions revealed similar results, although more students in the gamified group indicated that the online discussions forced them to think hard. The limited influence of the gamification approach in the current study may be attributed to several factors that related to the facilitation of the gamification approach, the types of badges, and technical issues. Implications and suggestions for future research have been discussed.;"[Ding, Lu] Univ Georgia, Dept Career & Informat Studies, Learning Design & Technol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Ding, Lu] Arizona State Univ, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers Coll, Learning & Cognit Lab, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA";Ding, L (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers Coll, Learning & Cognit Lab, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.;luding@uga.edu;NA;Ding, Lu/0000-0002-1454-1532;NA;NA;NA;73;11;12;2;27;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0747-5632;1873-7692;NA;COMPUT HUM BEHAV;Comput.

In other words, beyond a technical revolution, we first and foremost are in the presence of a mental revolution. For this reason, we think it is essential to help students to change their mental habits as early as possible and become familiar with at least the basic notions of distributed storage and cloud computing. In this paper, we introduce the Big Data Park system, which has been developed with an ambitious task in mind: gently introduce K-12 kids to the basics of big data and cloud computing, helping them to be part of this revolution. We report on the creation of the system, the challenges, and also the impact on higher K-18 education. The results, extensively tested in the field with a wide variety of kids and children, have been extremely successful, thanks also to advanced educational techniques like gamification. Moreover, the development and testing of the project have also provided valuable insights for the general problem of education of big data computing.;"[Marchiori, Massimo] European Inst Sci Media & Democracy, Ave Louise 457, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Marchiori, Massimo] Univ Padua, Via Trieste 63, I-35121 Padua, Italy";"Marchiori, M (corresponding author), European Inst Sci Media & Democracy, Ave Louise 457, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.; Marchiori, M (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Via Trieste 63, I-35121 Padua, Italy.";massimo@math.unipd.it;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;110;1;1;1;30;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1532-0626;1532-0634;NA;CONCURR COMP-PRACT E;Concurr.

The increase in teaching and learning methodologies that are mediated by ICT in the field of education and in the domestic settings encourages the design of new effective technological tools, supported by scientific research and development to improve student learning. The challenge psychology is facing in the education field is to promote those technologies and make them available to the education community. Technologies also would produce attractive items for users and realistic commercial issues for businesses. This also allows an effective transfer for scientific work, providing visibility to Research and Development. In this context, the main aim of the article is to describe the process to get an agreement between Babyradio (a children's entertainment company: https://babyradio.es/) and our research team, starting a collaborative work between two groups of people (Babyradio's technical designer and Psychologist-Engineers software designer), in order to create several educative applications (APPs) in the field of early mathematics cognition. The institutional framework of the relationship of the R&D project and a children's entertainment company is described. The article also focuses on experience in Psychology, Technological Innovation, and Entrepreneurship. In considering the efficiency of the agreement, we present different APPs designed for tablets and smartphone devices, adapted to the different operating systems (IOS, Android, Windows). APPs are designed to instill the cognitive fundamentals associated with early math learning for students aged 4 to 7 years. The study developed after this babyradio-university enterprise agreement contributes to the development of mathematics skills in children, aged 4-7 years, so that they can successfully meet the mathematics school requirements; it also contributes to encouraging a more positive attitude toward mathematics. This study also suggests how the education system and software and educational content developers' companies would manage verified instructional APPs, with a more realistic commercial perspective.";"[Mera, Carlos; Ruiz, Gonzalo; Aguilar, Manuel; Aragon, Estibaliz; Delgado, Candida; Menacho, Inmaculada; Marchena, Esperanza; Garcia Sedeno, Manuel; Navarro, Jose I.] Univ Cadiz, Dept Psychol, Cadiz, Spain";Navarro, JI (corresponding author), Univ Cadiz, Dept Psychol, Cadiz, Spain.;jose.navarro@uca.es;"Navarro, Jose I./D-8838-2011; Aragon, Estibaliz/AAA-6529-2019; Mera, Carlos/L-1829-2019; Aguilar, Manuel/AAE-3034-2021; Delgado Casas, Candida/L-5267-2014; Menacho Jimenez, Inmaculada/C-1665-2009";"Navarro, Jose I./0000-0002-0738-2641; Aragon, Estibaliz/0000-0002-0440-5705; Mera, Carlos/0000-0002-2557-5906; Delgado Casas, Candida/0000-0003-1012-8676; Menacho Jimenez, Inmaculada/0000-0002-0337-0993";MINECO/FEDER, Spain [PSI2015-63856-P];This work has been partially funded by R&D project number PSI2015-63856-P of MINECO/FEDER, Spain.;NA;29;3;3;0;28;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;1664-1078;NA;NA;FRONT PSYCHOL;Front.

According to the literature, ESD affects not only the content of education, but also its process and outcomes. This requires a new learning culture based on participative processes and new teaching techniques. Among the different methods and techniques as typologized by Figueira and Raufflet (2015), action and experiential learning methods offer a promising approach for teaching sustainability. However, no previous studies have empirically addressed the effects of this approach on sustainability learning outcomes. For this reason, with the objective of understanding the potentials and limitations of such methodology, this paper presents an exploratory study of a teaching experience based on the action and experiential learning approach, and in particular on the simulation game technique. A pre-game and post-game survey were developed to evaluate the students' learning experience of a business game focused on sustainability (napuro). The study was carried out at two universities in Switzerland. The results suggest that the action learning approach, and in particular, simulation and gaming, may successfully generate cognitive and affective learning outcomes which in turn may affect students' development of critical thinking skills. In addition, the study suggests the central role of motivation in influencing students' learning outcomes. The game seems to be more effective in influencing the student's expertise in the subject and their attitudes toward sustainability when the student records a high level of motivation to attend the course and interest in the subject before the game.

Although cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills are lifesaving skills, the gap between awareness and actual training remains significant. Advances in technology are shaping the future of education and innovative learning solutions are essential to facilitate effective and accessible training. This project objective is to develop a self-directed educational system for hands-on CPR training using virtual reality (VR) technology. Methods. HTC VIVE was the chosen VR engine, and Unity3D was the software used for development. CPR skills including chest compressions, rescue breathing, and automated external defibrillator (AED) are taught in VR through focused instructions, demonstrations, and simulated interactive scenarios with hands-on training sessions. A tracking system was designed using virtual planes and VIVE-Tracker for accurate measurements of chest compressions (rate, depth, and recoil), hands' position and AED. A real mannequin was integrated in the VR space and overlaid with virtual 3D-human model for realistic haptic feedback and hands-on training. VIVE-controller was used for precise calibration between the mannequin location in real environment and the virtual human model in VR space. Results. The VR-CPR prototype was designed to be generic, approachable, and easy to follow. Realism and interaction were achieved through 3D virtual scenes simulating common sites at which cardiac arrest may occur. Variety in scenarios and gamification features like scoring and difficulty levels of training were made to enhance users' engagement. The VR-mannequin hybrid system enabled quality training and immersive learning experience. Further, real-time feedback and scoring system are built for self-directed learning and optimal performance. Conclusions. The developed VR-hybrid product is a structured educational tool for hands-on CPR training and ongoing practice. This innovative technology provides self-directed learning with no restrictions of time, place, or personnel, which are the main challenges with current traditional courses. This product is a promising CPR training initiative in the evolution of digital education.;"[Almousa, Omamah] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Almousa, Omamah] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Qayumi, Karim] Univ British Columbia, Surg, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Prates, Joana; Yeslam, Noor; Mac Gregor, Dougal; Zhang, Junsong; Viet Phan] Ctr Digital Media, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [smith, Richard] Ctr Digital Media, Digital Media Program, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Nielsen, Marc] Dania Games, Grenaa, Denmark; [smith, Richard] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Commun, Burnaby, BC, Canada";Almousa, O (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Vasc Surg, 85 Robinson St,Apartment 901, Hamilton, ON L8P 3G1, Canada.;"Omamah.Almousa@gmail.com; joanamirandajm@gmail.com; nooryeslam@gmail.com; dougalmgu@gmail.com; zhangjunso77@gmail.com; Viet_Phan@thecdm.ca; marc2036@student.eadania.dk; smith@thecdm.ca; akqayumi@gmail.com";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;14;7;7;2;37;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;1046-8781;1552-826X;NA;SIMULAT GAMING;Simul.

Active learning methodologies were implemented for 54 students (mean age: 24.17 years), including an experiment in the classroom, the case method, the development of gamification strategies and the strengthening of constructive alignment. At the end of the course, a satisfaction questionnaire was administered to the students. Results. The learning methodology was one of the aspects most highly valued by the students, followed by learning outcomes and, to a lesser extent, the acquisition of competences. Conclusions. The implementation of innovative learning methodologies in the university environment has been satisfactory for the students, to a different extent depending on the aspect considered.;"[Cano-Lopez, Irene] Univ Int Valencia, Valencia, Spain; [Hidalgo, Vanesa] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain; [Gonzalez-Bono, Esperanza] Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain";Cano-Lopez, I (corresponding author), Univ Int Valencia, Valencia, Spain.;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;14;0;0;0;1;UNIV GRANADA, FAC CIENCIAS EDUCACION;GRANADA;CAMPUS UNIV CARTUJA S-N, GRANADA, 18071, SPAIN;2254-5883;NA;NA;REIDOCREA;ReiDoCrea;NA;2019;8;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;411;421;NA;NA;NA;NA;11;Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary;Social Sciences - Other Topics;MH3TN;WOS:000546656000023;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

After the continuous implementation of the communicative approach when teaching foreign languages during the last decades, the current society offers a wide range of attractive and motivating tools that can be easily used in education. The use of ICT, mobile apps and videogames comprise both a wide educational and funny experience. Gamification helps foreign languages students (no matter their age or level), experiment a more complex learning in which they are active and responsible participants of their own learning. Objectives/hypotheses. Perform an exhaustive analysis of the scientific literature on the subject. Method. The Dialnet, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Redalyc and ERIC databases from 2015 to the present are used. Results. There are 30 publications on gamification in a foreign language with 14 Spaniards in the last five years. Conclusions. The consolidation of gamification as a new learning method. Thanks to gamification, meaningful and motivating learning environments take place, digital and analogical game experiences are displayed and cooperative and collaborative learning is promoted while improving students' communicative competence.;[Chaves Yuste, Beatriz] Univ Antonio Nebrija, Madrid, Spain;Yuste, BC (corresponding author), Univ Antonio Nebrija, Madrid, Spain.;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;41;0;0;1;1;UNIV GRANADA, FAC CIENCIAS EDUCACION;GRANADA;CAMPUS UNIV CARTUJA S-N, GRANADA, 18071, SPAIN;2254-5883;NA;NA;REIDOCREA;ReiDoCrea;NA;2019;8;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;422;430;NA;NA;NA;NA;9;Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary;Social Sciences - Other Topics;MH3TN;WOS:000546656000024;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Researchers measured the degree of motivation of the students before, during and after designing and carrying out a BreakOut Edu for 5-year-old students. In this process, teacher coordination was encouraged throughout the project since it involved university teachers from different subjects. The role of these teachers was that of being guides to support students, acting in a coordinated way so that the activity encompassed contents from all of the subjects. The research methodology was based on the implementation of this activity and, after that, on surveying the participating students. Subsequently, data were analysed by using Nvivo 11Pro software for qualitative analysis.

In this context, we find a new teaching-learning model such as the flipped classroom (Bergmann and Sams, 2012). This methodology assumes that class time in the classroom is devoted to applying, experimenting, researching, etc.; that is, working at the highest levels of Bloom's taxonomy. To do this, the teacher must develop different practices or activities that serve the student to reinforce what was previously learned at home and that, following Santiago and Bergmann (2018) can be included within, among others, the following categories: peer-to-peer teaching, project-based learning, case studies, simulations, roleplaying, cooperative learning and gamification. In this paper, we present the students' assessment of the different techniques used when inverting the classroom in two subjects related to business management. More specifically, we analyze the degree of interest and fun they have aroused in them, as well as the extent to which each of these techniques has made them participate more actively, has improved the relationship with peers and with the teacher and has contributed to a greater understanding of the subject.

Increasingly sophisticated technological systems are steering societies into a new era that makes technology a very important tool. Children's minds are highly susceptible to technology enabling them to become skilful in using gadgets and in surfing the internet. However, the teaching and learning in classrooms still adopt traditional or conventional methods. This paper aims to critically examine the development of the portable application named Global Zakat Game (GZG) as one of the initiatives to help increase the level of education in Malaysia so that it will be in line with the development of information technology and communication today. The use of this application will also help teachers to disseminate universal values such as charity and raise awareness of issues such as the quest for peace both within the nation and globally, among people of different nations. A qualitative methodology was employed to analyse data using the inductive and deductive approach. The findings show that the GZG application could help students to understand the values of charity in zakat well, although it is only played online. This is because GZG encompasses almost the whole zakat syllabus including types of zakat, the rate of zakat, the calculation of zakat, and questions related to zakat. The education system should not lag behind in the use of technology and should upgrade its teaching-learning methodologies in line with the increasing sophistication of technology today. Through modern education awareness of global peace and values such as charity can be instilled and inculcated in the young. This paper suggests that through the teaching and learning of zakat using the portable applications GZG, global peace awareness and other relevant values could be successfully inculcated among students.;"[Ab Rahman, Muhamad Firdaus; Thaidi, Hussein 'Azeemi Abdullah] USIM, Fac Shariah & Law, Nilai, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia; [Ab Rahman, Azman; Ab Ghani, Nor Fatihah Amlin] USIM, Fac Syariah & Law, Nilai, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia; [Ab Rahman, Azman] USIM, World Fatwa Management & Res Inst INFAD, Nilai, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia";Ab Rahman, MF (corresponding author), USIM, Fac Shariah & Law, Nilai, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia.;"mfirdaus.rahman@usim.edu.my; azman@usim.edu.my; hussein@usim.edu.my; amlinfatihah@gmail.com";"Rahman, Muhamad Firdaus Ab/ABD-4830-2020; Thaidi, Hussein 'Azeemi Abdullah/AAJ-6256-2021";"Rahman, Muhamad Firdaus Ab/0000-0002-1502-9469; Thaidi, Hussein 'Azeemi Abdullah/0000-0001-9512-2542";"Ministry of Education (MoE) [USIM/PRGS/INFAD/FSU/055002/50117]; Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia (USIM) [PPI/GPI/FSU/051014/60118]";"The authors are grateful to the Ministry of Education (MoE) for funding this research project entitled Pembangunan Prototaip Gamifikasi Global Zakat Game Dalam Pendidikan Islam Bagi Kompetensi Pelajar dan Amil (research materials) through the Prototype Research Grant Scheme (PRGS), reference code [USIM/PRGS/INFAD/FSU/055002/50117].; This study also expresses its appreciation to the Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia (USIM) for funding this research project entitled Pembangunan Aplikasi Android Global Zakat Game (GZG)(research equipments) through the Innovation Development Grant, reference code [PPI/GPI/FSU/051014/60118].";NA;42;0;0;0;0;INT ISLAMIC UNIV MALAYSIA;KUALA LUMPUR;NO 24 PERSIARAN DUTA, TAMAN DUTA, KUALA LUMPUR, 50480, MALAYSIA;1394-6870;NA;NA;AL-SHAJARAH;Al-Shajarah;NA;2019;NA;NA;NA;NA;1;NA;169;189;NA;NA;NA;NA;21;Religion;Religion;KA5PX;WOS:000505851600010;NA;NA;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

But even with access to virtual 3D models, motivation is a key element for successful learning and for progressing over a longer period of time. Mixed reality spaces offer new opportunities for combining a 3D stereoscopic depth perception of anatomic models together with gamification and interactive learning. Virtual 3D models can be enhanced with additional information which can name and explain separate elements. Therefore, we developed GaMR, a gamified framework for learning in mixed reality, where 3D models can be experienced on the Microsoft HoloLens and the HTC Vive. Quiz creation is supported by placing annotations on the model. Progress is rewarded by badges. The gamification strategy guides the student and gives feedback about the learning progress. This open source gamification framework for mixed reality was evaluated with students and doctors from a medical university.

Gamification in the classroom consists in the use of the game designed mechanically and structurally to teach through game(s). It is important to note the difference between a game and gamification. A game, which is understood as a finished product and something concrete, unlike the gamification part of a didactic content which may be defined as an activity that contains the elements found in a spirit of play. Through this innovative methodology, effort is rewarded and valued, not only achievement, through the use of badges. Through this methodology, the game is treated as a motivating element in the classroom, and moreover it is a methodology which is considered as an active one because the student must be active and be the main character in the learning process. METHOD. This work involves the translation and validation of a GAMEX scale (Gameful Experience in Gamification) that measures the gamified experience in English and German. The sample consists of 224 participants related to education and gamified experiences (52% teachers and 48% students). Exploratory factor analysis (AFE) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were carried out to confirm the dimensional structure of the scale. RESULTS. The results show the complexity of evaluating gamified experiences from a unique and valid perspective, since several dimensions come into play. There are valid instruments that do not take into account all dimensions, and this proposed instrument shows a higher acceptable level of adjustment than the original model. DISCUSSION. The multi-dimensional nature of the gamified experience is emphasized and the need to create an instrument to evaluate it and improve future gamified experiences is highlighted.;"[Elena Parra-Gonzalez, Ma; Segura-Robles, Adrian] Univ Granada, Granada, Spain";Parra-Gonzalez, ME (corresponding author), Fac Educ Econ & Tecnol Ceuta, C Cortadura del Valle S-N, Ceuta 51001, Spain.;"elenaparra@ugr.es; adrianseg@ugr.es";Segura, Adrian/B-4963-2019;Segura, Adrian/0000-0003-0753-7129;NA;NA;NA;50;5;5;0;0;SOC ESPANOLA PEDAGOGIA, CONSEJO SUPERIOR INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS-CSIC;MARDID;ALBASANZ 26-28, 3C1, MARDID, 28037, SPAIN;0210-5934;2340-6577;NA;BORDON;Bordon;NA;2019;71;4;NA;NA;NA;NA;87;99;NA;10.13042/Bordon.2019.70783;NA;NA;13;Education & Educational Research;Education & Educational Research;JX9BS;WOS:000504022900005;NA;Bronze;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

From education to work to shopping, our activities are tracked, our progress is monitored, and rewards are meted out. But this enforced acceptance of constant surveillance constructs a social narrative in which privacy ceases to exist, and the technological tools at work can easily be shifted from reward to control. This is furthered through the shift from a Bentham-Foucault model of power and the threat of surveillance to the actualisation of complete protocological surveillance enabled by cloud computing, data centres, and machine learning. It is no longer the case that anything we do might be surveilled; we can be fairly certain that everything we do probably is being monitored, judged, and recorded. How can we negotiate these changing narratives? Of what fictions do we convince ourselves when we play the game called digital society? This article uses the work of Cory Doctorow, Charles Stross, Dave Eggers, and Ernest Cline to assess how fictionality can act as thought experiments for the social conditions of surveillance technologies. Through stories such as Halting State and Walkaway, we explore the collisions between the control-based society of tech companies and the disciplinary structures of traditional states-the points of tension between illusions of freedom, guided game paths, and the exercise of power over users' data and behaviours. The article argues for expanding our perspectives on the reach of game analysis to the broader connected networks of cultural and political systems, to assess ways of responding to the idea that we are being played with, turned into characters in the gamified narratives of control-based surveillance societies.";[Benjamin, Garfield] Solent Univ, Southampton, Hants, England;Benjamin, G (corresponding author), Solent Univ, Southampton, Hants, England.;garfield.benjamin@soylent.ac.uk;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;43;1;1;0;1;SURVEILLANCE STUDIES NETWORK;NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE;UNIV NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, GLOBAL URBAN RESEARCH UNIT, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, NE1 7RU, ENGLAND;1477-7487;NA;NA;SURVEILL SOC;Surveill.

Global populations live increasingly in urban landscapes, which creates an 'extinction of experience' when interacting with nature. In 2018, we facilitated 8 workshops with students aged 13 to 17 from two Maori immersion schools (Wharekura) to explore the application and implementation of a cultural monitoring framework. Although initial workshops demonstrated it was possible to apply the cultural monitoring method across ecosystems, the absence of basic ecological literacy was a significant challenge. We observed that uptake and understanding of basic environmental knowledge and ecological literacy increased markedly when we used gamification. We tested the potential of technology to enable pro-environmental behaviour and increase environmental literacy and indigenous knowledge to support student's connection to the natural world. Over the duration of this study, we developed a basic New Zealand ecology game, called Eko. The game fuses basic ecological concepts with indigenous Maori knowledge to provide a holistic view of the environment. Our survey results show that 90% of the students found our game entertaining, while 65% reported new knowledge acquisition. Our research revealed that while 'extinction of experience' in this area is rising globally, technology can be used as a mechanism to facilitate an increase in ecological literacy, indigenous knowledge, and pro-environmental behaviours. Our challenge in reversing the disconnection between our youth and the natural world is to explore the void between environment, technology, and indigenous knowledge. People should therefore be encouraged to explore how technological innovation can augment holistic solutions when connecting youth with their natural world.;"[Reihana, Kiri; Taura, Yvonne; Harcourt, Nichola] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Manaaki Taiao, Private Bag 3127, Hamilton, New Zealand";Reihana, K (corresponding author), Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Manaaki Taiao, Private Bag 3127, Hamilton, New Zealand.;ReihanaK@landcareresearch.co.nz;"Spraggs, Kiri Reihana/AAX-6013-2020; Taura, Yvonne/AAX-5345-2020";"Spraggs, Kiri Reihana/0000-0001-5569-6138; Taura, Yvonne/0000-0002-9160-4445; Harcourt, Nichola/0000-0002-8987-2328";Unlocking Curious Minds MBIE [C09X1719];This project was supported by Unlocking Curious Minds MBIE (C09X1719).

Nowhere else is this more important than in education. Considering the careful build-up and implementation of game-elements could improve academic performance outcome and student motivation. However, Gamification could require much more time to be designed and applied to education related activities and it also comes with significant operating and design cost to provide highly engaging activities for students. One of the main problems in designing Gamification is the question: which game elements should be applied to student activities?. Moreover one must make sure that it has great impact on students' performance in terms of their education related performance. Hence, in this research, we focused on studying the impact of each element in order to investigate the behavioral outcome of game elements in educational environments through the concept of knowledge and game-based learning from the Gamification concept. In our experiment, we examined the impact of each game element on senior high school students based on the basic elements of Gamification such as Leaderboard, Cooperative and Awarding badges. In addition, we studied the effect of the game-based learning application called Aqua Republica from UNEP and DHI centers with partner of Thailand. The experiment design compared two groups: the Non-Gamified and the Gamified groups participating in the game-based learning activity Aqua Republica. Academic indicators and numerical indicators were used to directly measure the effect and behavioral outcome of the use of game elements. Finally, the study suggested that leaderboards could improve the overall performance of students so it can be worth implementing it in classroom activities.;[Puritat, Kitti] Chiang Mai Univ, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, Chiang Mai, Thailand;Puritat, K (corresponding author), Chiang Mai Univ, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, Chiang Mai, Thailand.;kitti.p@cmu.ac.th;NA;Puritat, Kitti/0000-0003-0681-3064;NA;NA;NA;12;5;5;0;5;KASSEL UNIV PRESS GMBH;KASSEL;DIAGONALE 10, D-34127 KASSEL, GERMANY;2192-4880;NA;NA;INT J ENG PEDAGOG;Int.

Against the background of four different pilot cities with distinct water-related sustainability challenges, we present the implementation of the local platforms and how these have been effectively used by almost 1.000 active users, supporting an innovative engagement model that employed collaborative open innovation in online and offline settings for citizen-driven solution development to local sustainability challenges. We present the results from three series of citizen workshops where 150 participants provided valuable feedback, which was integrated in the further platform improvement. The evaluation confirmed its usability, enabling platform uptake among the target groups and its social impact by increasing awareness and knowledge.

'KAHOOT!' is an online multi-player real-time quiz game that allows students to measure learning in an engaging, immediate and entertaining manner. Lecturers can measure how well students absorb information and tailor their teaching to the next step or re-teach a concept after poor uptake by students. Seventy-two students participated in a 20-question survey about their experiences with 'KAHOOT!'. Engagement scores were correlated with assessment grades to measure if 'KAHOOT!' affected student learning and achievement. The survey was deemed statistically sound in reliability and validity testing, and a principal components analysis (PCA) revealed that the attributes were strongly linked. There was no relationship between engagement score and assessment grade, indicating that 'KAHOOT'!' did not directly increase achievement. However, assessment of individual responses identified that students found it to be a positive social learning technology as it provided a fun, competitive and immersive end to a class. The benefits of fostering engagement, enjoyment and immersion within adult learning are especially important for maintaining a level of achievement within education to ensure that students are better equipped to deal with challenges and can turn a potential failure into an opportunity to improve their scholarship. The challenge provided by this study is to identify now how to measure the value of 'fun' activities in the tertiary classroom as a reinforcer for engagement, participation and learning.;"[Cameron, Kristie E.] Unitec Inst Technol, Sch Environm & Anim Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Bizo, Lewis A.] Univ New England, Sch Psychol, Armidale, NSW, Australia";Cameron, KE (corresponding author), Unitec Inst Technol, Sch Environm & Anim Sci, Auckland, New Zealand.;kcameron@unitec.ac.nz;Bizo, Lewis/AAJ-7345-2020;"Bizo, Lewis/0000-0001-6030-6149; Cameron, Kristie/0000-0002-1623-4579";NA;NA;NA;26;5;5;3;12;ASSOC LEARNING TECHNOLOGY-ALT;BICESTER;PO BOX 460, BICESTER, OX26 9LW, ENGLAND;2156-7069;2156-7077;NA;RES LEARN TECHNOL;Res.

Design/methodology/approach - A preliminary survey of college students explored how gamification principles incorporated into money-savings/personal finance smartphone apps could improve financial well-being. The main study utilized Mechanical Turk participants, exposing them to financial game app descriptions that emphasized social features (e.g. leaderboards and ability to share achievements) or economic features (e.g. ability to earn real money or a higher interest rate). Objective and subjective financial measures including expertise with financial apps, perceived benefits of financial apps and behavioral intentions were examined. Findings - Financial worry, financial literacy, subjective knowledge and expertise with money-savings/financial applications predicted financial well-being. Additionally, consumers varied in their preferences for certain financial game app features based on past financial app experience. Those who already used a financial app tend to exhibit higher subjective (though not objective) knowledge, and want both social and economic features of financial applications, whereas those with no experience are more motivated by economic features. Practical implications - These results could be used to guide game designers regarding which features may be more attractive to consumers depending on their prior expertise with financial smartphone applications. Financial services marketing would benefit from further research into whether smartphone financial applications that emphasize social features have benefits for consumers' motivation and financial well-being. Originality/value - Examining college students about to enter the real world and the general population, this project contributes to research to improve understanding of financial well-being by examining how already having a financial gamification application impacts perceptions of knowledge and expertise, as well as intentions to save given a more socially focused vs economically focused savings app. Additional research needs to further explore gamification as an experimental intervention to ultimately improve both subjective financial well-being and objective financial behaviors, especially for consumers with lower expertise and high risk of financial vulnerability.;"[Bayuk, Julia] Univ Delaware, Dept Business Adm, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Altobello, Suzanne Aurora] Fayetteville State Univ, Dept Mkt Management & Entrepreneurship, Fayetteville, NC USA";Bayuk, J (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Business Adm, Newark, DE 19716 USA.;jbayuk@udel.edu;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;102;8;8;8;29;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;0265-2323;1758-5937;NA;INT J BANK MARK;Int.

One of the most useful skills that can be gained using specific tech-based environments is the establishment of an enterprise or, in short, the entrepreneurship, because it is part of the essential skills considered to be primary, according to the national education competences framework. The existing literature is concise regarding the development of methods of modelling business structures and processes, but the immersion in the education is standing at its early stages, related to the relatively low number of novel implementations in education and the potential. If in previous papers we have studied the structure of the intra-and inter-business relationships using system dynamics, this paper is intended to describe a future direction of development based on the study of business processes and their dynamic within the enterprise using specific tools described in the literature, as Unified Model Language (UML) and Business Process Model (BPM) for developing the theoretical model. The result of the study is intended to materialize in a piece of software that will be projected using software engineering based on UML methods and built on the principles of gamification in education.

This uncertain environment does not foster student effort and it is behind the important rates of abandon in higher education. The Bologna Process was thought to create a new paradigm in higher education in the European Union. However, the changes came from the top (governments) to the bottom (lectures and students) so they were not properly supported by specialized training oriented to lecturers. It did not include the appropriate changes in lower education stages (secondary education) to prepare student when facing University. Therefore, in the past decade several new teaching methodologies have appeared to deal with student demotivation and to fight against dropouts. Those methodologies try to keep the students engaged during the whole course paying more attention to their learning process, attitudes, motivations and expectations. Consequently, in this paper, we present a four-year experiment whose main objective is to keep students engaged during the whole year and to foster their motivation in order to increase their learning outcomes. The experiment is based on the application of gamification to the assessment process emulating a traditional platform video-game, like Super Mario. The results show that this experiment was positive for most students who achieved good marks and good rates of task completion.;"[Carlos Cuevas-Martinez, Juan; Jesus Yuste-Delgado, Antonio; Manuel Perez-Lorenzo, Jose] Univ Jaen, Dept Telecommun Engn, Linares 23700, Spain; [Trivino-Cabrera, Alicia] Univ Malaga, Dept Elect Engn, Malaga 29010, Spain";Cuevas-Martinez, JC (corresponding author), Univ Jaen, Dept Telecommun Engn, Linares 23700, Spain.;jccuevas@ujaen.es;"Lorenzo, Jose Manuel Perez/H-1694-2015; Yuste, A.J./B-1993-2015";"Lorenzo, Jose Manuel Perez/0000-0002-5286-8026; Yuste, A.J./0000-0002-9321-1709; Cuevas Martinez, Juan Carlos/0000-0003-3749-5986";Vicerrectorado de Ensenanzas de Grado, Postgrado y Formacion Permanente, Universidad de Jaen [PID21-201416];This work was supported by the Vicerrectorado de Ensenanzas de Grado, Postgrado y Formacion Permanente, Universidad de Jaen, through the Teaching Innovation Project, under Grant PID21-201416 that belongs to the 2017 Call of the Innovation and Encouraging of Good Teaching Practices Project of the Universidad de Jaen.;NA;25;2;2;3;14;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;NA;NA;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;NA;2019;7;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;118125;118134;NA;10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2932803;NA;NA;10;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";IV5YM;WOS:000484346100001;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

This article reports on the development and validation of a unified, comprehensive framework for evaluating the efficacy of games in teaching sexual health behaviors for curbing unhealthy sexual outcomes to secondary school adolescents in low resource settings. Methods: The initial validation of the MAKE framework was administered to 120 students using quantitative data collection and analysis. It was then subjected to factor analysis tests to investigate the items' structure, and Cronbach's alpha was applied to measure the scale reliability using SPSS Version 24. Results: Data analyses demonstrate that the MAKE framework is a comprehensive instrument to evaluate teaching methods with four powerful constructs, each of which has two to four components. For each construct, the following data were obtained: for motivation, standardized alpha = 0.92, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) = 0.88, and p = 0.001; for attitude, standardized Cronbach's alpha = 0.90, KMO = 0.88, and p = 0.001; for knowledge, standardized alpha = 0.92, KMO = 0.86, and p = 0.001; and finally, for engagement, standardized alpha = 0.90, KMO = 0.87, and p = 0.001. Cronbach's alpha for each component was above the cut-off point (0.65). Conclusions: This study shows that the MAKE framework is a satisfactory instrument for assessing the efficacy of teaching methods for sexual health literacy in a variety of teaching environments.

Background The role of gamification in promoting students' learning has been investigated empirically by many scholars. To date, mixed results about the effectiveness of gamification have been reported, and researchers frequently argue that the inappropriateness of certain techniques may have contributed to these mixed findings. Methodology The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol was used to assess the criteria required for this review A total of 40 studies were identified and included in the systematic review. The selected studies were used to assess the association between certain gamification techniques and students' learning in this study. Findings The results showed that gamification techniques differently affect students' learning. In addition, it is important for students to be instructed about the application of gamification approach before they engage in a gamified learning task. The key challenges relating to the use of gamification techniques were also discussed.

In the last few years, gamification has been widely used to improve learning experiences in various environments. Education is one of the fields that adopted gamification as technological innovation to increase student engagement since it plays a critical role in higher education, especially in digital learning environments. Today, learning management systems (LMSs) are commonly used to facilitate learning processes. However, the engagement and the motivation of students when using such systems require extra attention. There is a need for an instructor to incorporate digital technologies with esteemed innovations to create an engaging learning environment. Increasing students' engagement is said to be evidence of increased learning. Therefore, this paper addresses these challenges by designing, developing, and evaluating a gamified collaborative discussion environment on the moodle LMS. To achieve this, the students in a postgraduate course used a gamified online discussion environment for eight weeks during group work to complete their term projects. Students' online learning pre-test and post-test data are utilized to investigate students' engagement in a gamified discussion environment. The results illustrate that there is a significant difference between pre-test and post-test results, which shows that the gamified online discussion environment has improved students' engagement. Furthermore, students that highly accessed the online course activities had a good engagement, which motivated students to conduct online collaboration according to the game-feature context.;"[Hasan, Hasan Fahmi; Nat, Muesser; Vanduhe, Vanye Zira] Cyprus Int Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Management Informat Syst Dept, CY-99010 Nicosia, Cyprus";Hasan, HF (corresponding author), Cyprus Int Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Management Informat Syst Dept, CY-99010 Nicosia, Cyprus.;20141234@student.ciu.edu.tr;"Nat, Muesser Cemal/T-2569-2019; Vanduhe, Vanye Zira/K-2379-2019; Hasan, Hasan Fahmi/ABG-4303-2020";"Nat, Muesser Cemal/0000-0002-1539-3586; Hasan, Hasan/0000-0001-5235-9937";NA;NA;NA;54;5;5;1;8;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;NA;NA;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;NA;2019;7;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;89833;89844;NA;10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2926622;NA;NA;12;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";IK8BG;WOS:000476817400014;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Usually, these online courses offer universal access to learning, generating new challenges regarding the form they are taught and the pedagogical approaches used. In fact, despite the benefits of MOOCs in Higher Education (e.g. ubiquitous and free access to learning), these courses are frequently critized due to their content-based teaching models. Therefore, the application of strategies promoting active learning is presented as a potential technique to change these models and to improve the student participation and dropout rates. This paper reflects on the potential benefits of gamification and collaboration to enhance and motivate student involvement in MOOCs. To this end, a Design-Based Research (DBR) methodology has been applied aiming to show evidence of these pedagogical innovations in three MOOCs carried out by the University of Valladolid (Spain).

To compare pharmacy students' assessment and evaluation ratings of a newly formatted nonprescription products course that used innovative technology and gaming to that for a traditional nonprescription products course. Methods. Examination scores and course evaluations of students who completed the traditional course on nonprescription products were analyzed and compared with those of students who completed a revised course on nonprescription products that used teaching techniques in educational technology. Results. Students in the traditional course significantly outperformed those in the comparator group in eight nonprescription categories on examinations, while students in the new course significantly outperformed those in the comparator group in four categories. Students in the new course outperformed those in the traditional course in two additional examination categories, however these were not significant. Almost all students in both courses agreed or strongly agreed with each course evaluation item, including those items where use of gamification and iBooks were most likely considered. Conclusion. Improvements in student examination performance and course satisfaction may not be immediately seen in a course in which new teaching techniques using educational technology including gamification and iBooks are introduced.;"[Dicks, Melanie; Romanelli, Frank] Univ Kentucky, Coll Pharm, 789 S Limestone St, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Romanelli, Frank] Amer Journal Pharmaceut Educ, Arlington, VA USA";Dicks, M (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Coll Pharm, 789 S Limestone St, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.;melanie.dicks@uky.edu;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;17;0;0;0;4;AMER ASSOC COLL PHARMACY;ALEXANDRIA;1426 PRINCE STREET, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2815 USA;0002-9459;1553-6467;NA;AM J PHARM EDUC;Am.

This action research case study aims to determine if a digital educational game can stimulate interest and engagement with mathematics. SpeedyRocket, a digital educational game was designed and used in the classroom in three schools in rural Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria to teach pupils about estimation, as part of the mathematics curriculum. The evaluation was carried out with the pupils through a combination of a pupils' mathematics attitude questionnaire, and classroom observation.

Our program's prior AC had residents learning in isolation, achieving completion via quizzes before advancing without the benefit of deliberate knowledge reinforcement. We sought to increase engagement and spaced repetition by creating a social AC using gamification. Methods: We created a website featuring monthly options from textbooks and open-access medical education. Residents selected four hours of material, and then submitted learning points. Using these learning points, trivia competitions were created. Residents competed in teams as houses during didactic conference, allowing for spaced repetition. Residents who were late in completing AC assignments caused their house to lose points, thus encouraging timely completion. Results: Completion rates prior to deadline are now >95% compared to similar to 30% before intervention. Surveys show increased AC enjoyment with residents deeming it more valuable clinically and for EM board preparation. Conclusion: Socially synchronized AC offers a previously undescribed method of increasing resident engagement via gamification.;"[Smart, Jon; Olson, Adriana Segura; Muck, Andrew] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Emergency Med, 7703 Floyd Curl Dr,MC 7736, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA";Smart, J (corresponding author), Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Emergency Med, 7703 Floyd Curl Dr,MC 7736, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA.;jondsmart@gmail.com;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4;1;1;0;0;WESTJEM;ORANGE;C/O SHAHRAM LOTFIPOUR, MD, MPH, 333 CITY BLVD W STE 640, RT 128-01, ORANGE, CA 92868 USA;1936-900X;1936-9018;NA;WEST J EMERG MED;West.

Its characteristics of being free, heterogeneous, multi-thematic, and fostering lifelong learning have completely changed the instructional design scene, allowing these innovations and new architectures of teaching and learning to be included. However, MOOCs have been criticized by the scientific community for their high dropout rates and low overall completion rates, which has called into question their effectiveness as a pedagogical tool. This paper analyzes how the application of gamification strategies in MOOCs on energy sustainability affects participants' engagement and seeks to identify what types of interactive gamification media are more useful in generating interest and motivation in students. In order to do so, a mixed quasi-experimental method is used. A gamification board with challenges, badges, and leaderboards to a sample is used, and at the same time, this platform is analyzed using the integrated theoretical gamification model in e-learning environments. In the MOOCs where gamification strategies were applied, a global completion rate of 14.43% was obtained, while in those without gamification, 6.162% was obtained. Likewise, the degree of student engagement with respect to the completion rate of activities was much higher in the gamified platform (28.032%) than in the traditional design (13.252%). The results show that applying gamification strategies in MOOCs achieves a higher level of engagement and student motivation.;"[Romero-Rodriguez, Luis M.; Soledad Ramirez-Montoya, Maria; Valenzuela Gonzalez, Jaime Ricardo] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Humanities & Educ, Monterrey 64849, Mexico";Romero-Rodriguez, LM (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Humanities & Educ, Monterrey 64849, Mexico.;luis@romero-rodriguez.com;"Romero-Rodriguez, Luis M./P-8698-2014; Ramirez-Montoya, Maria-Soledad/AAF-4642-2020; Valenzuela Gonzalez, Jaime Ricardo/B-4171-2017";"Romero-Rodriguez, Luis M./0000-0003-3924-1517; Valenzuela Gonzalez, Jaime Ricardo/0000-0003-3999-501X";CONACYT-SENER [266632, S0019201401];This work was supported by the energy sustainability fund CONACYT-SENER through the Project 266632 Laboratorio Binacional para la Gestion Inteligente de la Sustentabilidad Energetica y la Formacion Tecnologica'' under Grant S0019201401.;NA;43;14;14;5;23;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;NA;NA;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;NA;2019;7;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;32093;32101;NA;10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2903230;NA;NA;9;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";HR0XO;WOS:000462852500001;NA;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

One should learn sign language to interact with them. Learning usually takes place in peer groups. There exist very few study materials for sign learning. Because of this, the process of learning sign language learning is a difficult task. Fingerspelled sign learning is the initial stage of sign learning and moreover, are used when no corresponding sign exists or signer is not aware of it. Most of the existing tools for sign language learning use external sensors which are costly. This paper discusses SignQuiz, which is a cost-effective web-based fingerspelled sign learning application for Indian sign language (ISL) utilizing automatic sign language recognition technique. SignQuiz helps to learn signs without any external help. This is the first attempt in ISL for learning finger spelled signs using a deep neural network.

The increasing availability of virtual reality (VR) systems brings VR-based visualization of program code structures into practical reach for software developers and could support program comprehension and insight. However, the complete visual immersion with VR presents a cognitive burden and potential distractions. Applying gamification to such a VR visualization capability has hitherto been insufficiently investigated as to its potential motivation and program comprehension factors. This paper describes and evaluates a VR digital gamification approach for program code called VR Gamified Immersion in Software structures (VR-GaImS), which applies digital gamification to a multi-metaphor VR visualization of software program structures. The results of a preliminary empirical investigation utilizing our prototype indicate its potential to increase enjoyment and motivation, focus attention, and encourage the exploration of software structures.;"[Oberhauser, Roy; Lecon, Carsten] Aalen Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Aalen, Germany";Oberhauser, R (corresponding author), Aalen Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Aalen, Germany.;"roy.oberhauser@hs-aalen.de; carsten.lecon@hs-aalen.de";NA;Oberhauser, Roy/0000-0002-7606-8226;NA;NA;NA;25;0;0;1;9;ACTA PRESS;CALGARY;2509 DIEPPE AVE SW, BLDG B6, STE 101, CALGARY, AB T3E 7J9, CANADA;2561-1771;2561-178X;NA;MECHATRON SYST CONTR;Mechatron.

The necessity of ensuring quality is, however, not the only thing that has made an impact on the educational process, it being a cumulative effort of more forces, with ICT (Information and Communication technologies) and web technologies being some of them. Using ICT in education was always a challenge to enhance learning, especially when it comes to using web 2.0 elements that include blogging. The paper explores the following aspects: (1) Combining gamification elements in class blogs, adding extra enhancements to learning which can be reflected in the student's blogs posts and can be measured using Google analytics and (2) Using quality management tools and creativity techniques to ensure quality for each stage of teacher/student blogging cycle. The purpose of the research is to emphasize an original path to ensure quality in education by integrating quality management tools and web 2.0 tools and using highly effective development approaches such as the ones embodied by the Agile approach.;"[Dovleac, Raluca; Sad, Ahmad; Ionica, Andreea; Leba, Monica] Univ Petrosani, Str Univ 20, Petrosani 332006, Romania";Dovleac, R (corresponding author), Univ Petrosani, Str Univ 20, Petrosani 332006, Romania.;raluca.dovleac@yahoo.com;Dovleac, Raluca/AAK-4358-2021;NA;NA;NA;NA;7;1;1;3;5;SOC ROMANA PENTRU ASIGURAREA CALITATII;BUCHAREST;STR VASILE PARVAN NR 14, SECTOR 1, POSTAL CODE 010 216, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA;1582-2559;NA;NA;QUAL-ACCESS SUCCESS;Qual.-Access Success;JAN;2019;20;NA;NA;1;NA;NA;329;334;NA;NA;NA;NA;6;Management;Business & Economics;HM7UX;WOS:000459686300058;NA;NA;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

The impact and consequences of this innovative technology have not yet been satisfactory explored. This empirical study investigated the cognitive and social aspects of collaboration in a shared, immersive virtual reality. A unique application for implementing a collaborative immersive virtual environment (LIVE) was developed by our interdisciplinary team as a software solution for educational purposes, with two scenarios for learning about hypsography, i.e., explanations of contour line principles. Both scenarios allow switching between a usual 2D contour map and a 3D model of the corresponding terrain to increase the intelligibility and clarity of the educational content. Gamification principles were also applied to both scenarios to augment user engagement during the completion of tasks. A qualitative research approach was adopted to obtain a deep insight into the lived experience of users in a LIVE. It was thus possible to form a deep understanding of very new subject matter. Twelve pairs of participants were observed during their LIVE experience and then interviewed either in a semistructured interview or a focus group. Data from these three research techniques were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis, which is research method for studying individual experience. Four superordinate themes-with detailed descriptions of experiences shared by numerous participants-emerged as results from the analysis; we called these (1) Appreciation for having a collaborator, (2) The Surprising Fun with Maps, (3) Communication as a challenge, and (4) Cognition in two realities.

Programming is difficult for students to learn, given that it includes a lot of new, complex, and abstract topics. All of this has led experts to the conclusion that new teaching techniques are required if students are to be motivated and engaged in learning on programming courses. Gamification has come to be an effective technique in education in general, and is especially useful in programming courses. This motivated us to develop an open source gamified platform, called UDPiler, for use in a programming course. Objective: The main goal of this article is to obtain empirical evidence on the improvement of students' learning performance when using UDPiler in comparison to a non-gamified compiler. Method: A quasi-experiment was performed with two groups of first-year engineering students at Diego Portales University in Chile, using a non-gamified compiler and a gamified platform, respectively. Results: The results reveal that the students obtained better marks when the gamified platform was used to learn C programming. In addition, there is statistical significance in favor of there being a positive effect on the learning performance of those students who used the gamified platform. Conclusions: The results allow us to conclude that gamification is an encouraging approach with which to teach C programming, a finding that is aligned with previous empirical studies concerning gamification on programming courses, carried out in academic contexts. Nonetheless, we are aware that further validation is also required to corroborate and strengthen the findings obtained and to investigate whether the kind of gamified elements (mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics) used have any influence on students' performance, among other issues that deserve further investigation and that are explained throughout this article.;"[Marin, B.; Frez, J.] Univ Diego Portales, Escuela Informat, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Ejercito 441, Santiago, Chile; [Cruz-Lemus, J.; Genero, M.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Informat Syst & Technol, Paseo Univ 4, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain";Marin, B (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Escuela Informat, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Ejercito 441, Santiago, Chile.;"beatriz.marin@mail.udp.cl; jonathan.frez@mail.udp.cl; JoseAntonio.Cruz@uclm.es; Marcela.Genero@uclm.es";"Marin, Beatriz/AAI-7783-2021; Marin, Beatriz/Z-5032-2019; Cruz-Lemus, Jose A./B-7299-2015";"Marin, Beatriz/0000-0001-8025-0023; Cruz-Lemus, Jose A./0000-0002-0470-609X";"CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [REDI170020]; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional and Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [TIN2015-63502-C3-1-R]; Consejeria de Educacion, Cultura y Deportes de la Direccion General de Universidades, Investigacion e Innovacion de la JCCM";This work has been developed within the ENSE Project (REDI170020) funded by CONICYT, the SEQUOIA Project, (TIN2015-63502-C3-1-R) (MINECO/FEDER) funded by Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional and Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, and the GEMA project funded by Consejeria de Educacion, Cultura y Deportes de la Direccion General de Universidades, Investigacion e Innovacion de la JCCM.;NA;45;14;14;2;29;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA;1946-6226;NA;NA;ACM T COMPUT EDUC;ACM Trans.

DESIGN: The authors designed an Escape Room combining Vascular Surgery objectives, knowledge-based problems and technical skills into Vascular Surgery-themed stations. Groups of 3 to 4 medical students participated in the activity. Data collected included time to escape, CanMEDS roles covered during the activity, debriefing interview session, and satisfaction survey. SETTING: The Escape Room was installed at the University of Ottawa Skills and Simulation Centre at the Ottawa Hospital, a tertiary care center. PARTICIPANTS: Medical students in their preclerkship years of study were invited to participate in the Escape Room. In total, 13 medical students completed the experience, divided into 4 groups. RESULTS: Thirteen medical students divided into 4 groups participated in the Escape Room. Two teams used a collaborative strategy to complete the activity and successfully escaped with an average time of 53.6 minutes, whereas only 1 of the 2 teams completing the experience employing an individualistic strategy successfully escaped. Following the experience, 83% of participants stated that the experience motivated them to prepare beforehand and believed that the experience consolidated the knowledge that they had read. All the participants also reported that the experience encouraged the use of the CanMEDS communicator and collaborator roles. As well, 76.9% of students mentioned that they enjoyed the practical exercises incorporated into the experience and 53.8% stated that they would like to see the Escape Room format included in the medical curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: By combining knowledge-based problems, key learning objectives, technical skills, and CanMEDS themes into the Escape Room, the authors have developed a learning platform that may be more enjoyable and provide an adjunct to traditional didactic lectures.

Games have become more pervasive: they have been adopted for use in many industries and sectors such as defense, medicine, architecture, education, and city planning and government as tools for workers development. In Malaysia, it has been reported that t he construction industry holds the third highest record of occurrences of accidents at work. Therefore, safety training is inevitable to reduce the alarming rate of accidents on construction sites. However, currently, available safety training approaches are still lacking in terms of delivering hands-on training and are more theoretical-instead of being more practical-based. This is due to the nature of the construction environment itself in which safety training involving certain hazards that cannot be implemented hands-on as it may bring harm to trainers, trainees and the environment. Gaming is an approach that applies technology to provide an almost real experience with interactive field training, and also supporting the theory of learning by doing with real case scenario. The purpose of this paper is to seek and explore the differences in existing gamification genres such as simulation game, role-playing, action game, strategy game and etc. Data were collected through available literature.

In this game, students have 30 min in which they must solve the riddles and puzzles presented, and thus escape. In doing so, they must demonstrate both theoretical and practical knowledge, and a teacher will remain in the classroom to assess whether the nursing techniques in question are correctly performed. Results: The nursing students who took part in the game strongly believed that this 'helped them learn the subject' (4.8 points) and that 'more games of this type should be included in their nursing studies' (4.8 points). Overall, they considered that 'the game was enjoyable' (4.6 points), 'helped them in the exam' (4.6 points), and 'motivated them to study' (4.5 points). Conclusions: The 'Escape Room' is a useful game; it stimulates learning, is fun to play, and motivates studying.";"[Gomez-Urquiza, Jose L.; Albendin-Garcia, Luis; Correa-Rodriguez, Maria; Gonzalez-Jimenez, Emilio; Canadas-De la Fuente, Guillermo A.] Univ Granada, Fac Hlth Sci, Ave Ilustrac S-N, Granada 18016, Spain; [Gomez-Salgado, Juan] Univ Huelva, Dept Nursing, Ave Tres Marzo S-N, Huelva 21071, Spain; [Gomez-Salgado, Juan] Univ Espiritu Santo, Guayaquil, Ecuador";Gomez-Urquiza, JL (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Fac Hlth Sci, Ave Ilustrac S-N, Granada 18016, Spain.;"jlgurquiza@ugr.es; lualbgar1979@ugr.es; macoro@ugr.es; emigoji@ugr.es; gacf@ugr.es";"la Fuente, Guillermo A.

Currently coexist more than 10,000 mobile applications (apps) that intermingle instructional design, educational content and playful interaction elements. However, there is no consensus in the scientific community about how to evaluate and assess Games Based Learning (GBL) of these platforms. This research aims to apply the Theoretical Integrated Gamification Model Environments E-Learning (E-MIGA) at 10 apps with more downloads in AppStore (IOS) and PlayStore (Android), through a judgment of 30 experts in the field of e-learning and gamification, to transform this theoretical model into an instrument of Quantifiable dimensions and indicators. A pilot with scores drawn from expert judgment apps aforementioned test is then applied.

Game-based interventions, such as gamification and game-based learning, have huge potential to be effective learning tools. This paper examines the potential of gamification to improve waste management practices among schoolchildren through a narrative review of 25 papers on gamification for waste management and gamification for schoolchildren. The effectiveness of game-based learning and gamification in mitigating waste management issues with schoolchildren has not yet been well-described in the literature; however, the evolving market in related sectors is a strong indication of their potential. A robust understanding of social and behavioral theories is necessary for implementing gamification and game-based learning effectively. Additionally, the game elements, design, and mechanics that can achieve the most positive impacts should be explored further. It is hoped that this study will contribute to the body of knowledge in the environmental sector on gamification as an innovative process for improving household-level waste management behavior among schoolchildren.";"[Magista, Malida; Dorra, Bella Lexmita] WISE WASH Southeast Asia, Programs Team, Komp OPI Jl Bali 4 AX 21,15 Ulu,Seberang Ulu 1, Kota Palembang 30257, Sumatera Selata, Indonesia; [Pean, Thye Yoke] WISE WASH Southeast Asia, Core Team, 96 Jalan Leban, Singapore 577628, Singapore";Pean, TY (corresponding author), WISE WASH Southeast Asia, Core Team, 96 Jalan Leban, Singapore 577628, Singapore.;yokepean@washinseasia.org;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;51;3;3;1;9;UNIV INDONESIA, FAC ENGINEERING;DEPOK;KAMPUS UI DEPOK, DEPOK, 16424, INDONESIA;2086-9614;2087-2100;NA;INT J TECHNOL;Int.

In order to make sense of the contradictory findings regarding the effectiveness of implementing game design elements in an online learning environment, this paper complements the available body of research by addressing three holes. We have (1) analysed gamification's underlying motivational processes from a Self-Determination Theory-perspective, thereby accounting for the motivational effects of various game design implementations; (2) empirically assessed subtle motivational changes over time, and (3) accounted for the potential individual differences in motivational effects of gamification. Over a period of 15 weeks, we administered four surveys to measure the possible evolution in students' (N = 40) motivational levels in response to interacting with need-supporting game elements that were implemented in Google + Communities used in a university course. Participants' autonomous and controlled motivation was curve linear, showing an initial downward trend that surprisingly shifted to an upward tendency towards the end of the semester. Their controlled motivation stayed stable throughout. The results illustrated the significance of the individual nature of motivational processes, the importance of sensitive longitudinal motivation measurements, and the relevance of the implemented game elements' design characteristics.

This review identifies interventions that use social media to promote nutrition, examines their content and features, and evaluates the evidence for the use of such platforms among these groups. Material and methods: We conducted a systematic search of 5 databases (PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and ACM Digital Library) for studies that included: 1) adolescents and/or young adults (ages 10-19; ages 18-25); 2) a nutrition education or behavior change intervention component, or outcomes related to nutrition knowledge or dietary changes; and 3) a social media component that allowed users to communicate or share information with peers. Results: 16 articles were identified that included a social media component in a nutrition-related intervention for adolescents or young adults. Interventions included features in 7 categories: social media; communication; tracking health; education; tailoring; social support; and gamification. 11 out of the 16 studies had at least one significant nutrition-related clinical or behavioral outcome. Conclusion: Social media is a promising feature for nutrition interventions for adolescents and young adults. A limited number of studies were identified that included social media. A majority of the identified studies had positive outcomes. We found that most studies utilized only basic social media features, did not evaluate the efficacy of social media components, and did not differentiate between the efficacy of social media compared to other delivery mechanisms.";"[Chau, Michelle M.; Burgermaster, Marissa; Mamykina, Lena] Columbia Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, 622 West 168th St,PH 20, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Burgermaster, Marissa] Univ Texas Austin, Nutr Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Burgermaster, Marissa] Univ Texas Austin, Dell Med Sch, Populat Hlth, Austin, TX 78712 USA";Chau, MM (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, 622 West 168th St,PH 20, New York, NY 10032 USA.;mmc2106@cumc.columbia.edu;NA;"Burgermaster, Marissa/0000-0002-4891-3314; Mamykina, Lena/0000-0001-5203-274X";"National Library of MedicineUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Library of Medicine (NLM) [T15 LM00707]; National Science Foundation Smart and Connected Health [1551708]; NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Library of Medicine (NLM) [T15LM007079] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";This work was supported by the National Library of Medicine [T15 LM00707] and the National Science Foundation Smart and Connected Health [1551708];NA;87;11;12;9;72;ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD;CLARE;ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND;1386-5056;1872-8243;NA;INT J MED INFORM;Int.

Latin American (LA) countries members of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) are under the urge and should be obligated to teach AW. The aims of this article are to analyze the current drives of change on the importance of teaching animal welfare in LA, the competences recommended from international education organizations for the region, and to provide the contents on the curriculum in AW that a future veterinarian should achieve in the LA scenario, in other words to examine why teaching AW, what should be taught and how. Despite significant advances in introducing AW into veterinary training programs, much remains to be done regarding the future of this field in teaching veterinary science in Spain and LA countries, and in including this science as an independent course in programs at distinct levels to integrate the scientific, ethical and legal aspects of AW. This paper presents a proposal that was constructed with a view towards integrating diverse curricular approaches based on criteria, contents and concepts provided by the researchers and professors who collaborated in the book entitled: Bienestar Animal: Una Vision Global en Iberoamerica [Animal Welfare: A Global Vision in Ibero-America].

This paper reports the quasiexperimental study in which we evaluated the learning effectiveness of GAMES in terms of supporting students' knowledge construction, in comparison with the conventional outdoor enquiry-based learning approach. It involved a total of 559 Grade-10 students from top, middle, and bottom academic-banding schools. Results indicated that, compared to the conventional approach, GAMES had different degrees of positive effects on the high, moderate, and low academic-achieving participants.

However, there is still lack of awareness among educators and the concern of whether the gamification technique is acceptable by students. This paper presents the effectiveness of gamification technique to improve students' engagement in Database Design subject at Polytechnic Muadzam Shah Pahang, Malaysia. A framework to implement the gamification technique in higher education is also described. As for the evaluation, an empirical investigation method is adapted and data was collected based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Student Course Engagement Questionnaire (SCEQ). The evaluation results indicate that the students positively inclined towards gamification caused by the ease of the platform used rather than the benefits that they can obtain from the gamification, concluding that Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) is a better indicator for students' attitude towards gamification.;"[Ab Rahman, Rafidah] Polytech Muadzam Shah, Muadzam Shah 26700, Pahang, Malaysia; [Ahmad, Sabrina; Hashim, Ummi Rabaah] Univ Teknikal Malaysia Melaka, Fac Informat & Commun Technol, Ctr Adv Comp Technol, Durian Tunggal 76100, Melaka, Malaysia";Ahmad, S (corresponding author), Univ Teknikal Malaysia Melaka, Fac Informat & Commun Technol, Ctr Adv Comp Technol, Durian Tunggal 76100, Melaka, Malaysia.;"rafidah@pms.edu.my; sabrinaahmad@utem.edu.my";Ahmad, Sabrina/AAG-6363-2020;Ahmad, Sabrina/0000-0002-4277-2063;Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka [PJP/2017/FTMK-CACT/S01573];The publication of this paper (if applicable) is funded by Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka through a research grant numbered PJP/2017/FTMK-CACT/S01573.;NA;21;9;9;0;12;SPRINGEROPEN;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND;2365-9440;NA;NA;INT J EDUC TECHNOL H;Int.

Team rankings and learning progress in game learning analytics, however, have yet to be empirically examined. Using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to study the performance of competing teams in a web marketing serious game (Simbound), we highlight a combination of causal conditions (engagement, reach and profitability) affecting team rankings. This paper proposes a conceptual architecture of the forces that influence learning progress within a collaborative learning environment. This learning environment is studied for web marketing boot camps powered by Simbound at three European universities: Grenoble Alpes University (France), University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy) and Dunarea de Jos University of Galati (Romania). Gaining knowledge of cases through game learning analytics is valuable for two reasons: It emphasises the instructor's role in mobilising players' engagement, and it tests variability across cases, offering precursors of team performance rankings. This approach to collective skill retention highlights the moderating factors of team performance rankings, whilst purposely calibrating a gameable learning environment.

The most well-known competition, SimWars, consists of well-coordinated teams that are tasked with completing a series of mind-bending clinical scenarios in front of a live audience through 'bracket-style' elimination rounds. Similarly, challenging hazards amidst observational simulation (CHAOS) in the emergency department (ED) is another novel approach to gamification in both its structure and feel. Conducted at the Council of Emergency Medicine Resident Directors (CORD) 2018 National Assembly in San Antonio, Texas, instead of assigning premeditated teams, it placed random Emergency Medicine (EM) faculty, residents, and medical students together in teams to test them on a variety of fundamental EM content areas. Additionally, the event incorporated multiple levels within each round, allowing the inclusion of additional information to be shared with participants to support switching gears, as is typical for teams working in the ED and augmenting the perceived level of chaos. To assess this pilot project, formal quantitative and qualitative feedback was solicited at the end of the session. Quantitative evaluation of the intervention was obtained through an eight-item questionnaire using a five-point Likert-type scale from 19 of the 20 enrolled participants (95% response rate). Responses were generally positive with an overall course rating score of 4.45 out of 5 (SD +/- 0.62). Qualitative feedback revealed that learners enjoyed performing procedures and networking with their EM colleagues. The majority of residents (95%) recommend the activity be integrated into subsequent conferences. Areas for improvement included shorter cases and minimizing technical malfunctions. CHAOS in the ED was a successful pilot study that incorporated gamification as a means to deploy simulation-based training at a national emergency medicine conference in a community of simulation educators. Future studies should focus on incorporating learners' feedback into subsequent CHAOS iterations and reducing overhead costs to increase its adoption by both regional and national audiences.;"[Salerno, Nicholas] Louisiana State Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr New Orleans, Emergency Med, New Orleans, LA USA; [Papanagnou, Dimitrios; Zhang, Xiao Chi] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Mahesh, Priyha] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Sidney Kimmel Med Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Bowers, Kaitlin M.] Ohio Med, Emergency Med Residency, Columbus, OH USA; [Pasichow, Scott H.] Brown Univ, Alpert Med Sch, Emergency Med, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Paradise, Sara] Univ Calif Irvine, Emergency Med, Orange, CA 92668 USA";Zhang, XC (corresponding author), Thomas Jefferson Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.;xzhang09@gmail.com;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;11;1;1;0;2;CUREUS INC;PALO ALTO;PO BOX 61002, PALO ALTO, CA 94306 USA;NA;2168-8184;NA;CUREUS;Cureus;NOV;2018;10;11;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;e3563;10.7759/cureus.3563;NA;NA;14;Medicine, General & Internal;General & Internal Medicine;HL4MI;WOS:000458695500030;30648095;Other Gold, Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

This study employed a mixed-method research approach, using three formative assessments or a post-test only design to examine students' learning achievement. Questionnaires and personal interviews were employed to support the data collection process in terms of students' perceived motivation. Fifty-six students were the respondents involved in a non-randomized experiment with a control group design. The results reveal that assessment 1 showed no significant difference between the two groups of the gamified flipped and non-gamified flipped classroom instruction (t = 1.68, p.474), while assessment 2 and 3 were significantly different (t = 5.54, p = .007 < .05) and (t = 10.17, p = .001 < .05). In the present study, the findings confirm that the students were positive regarding perceived competence, autonomy, and relatedness, better performance, and were able to achieve good achievement during the tests. The survey results reveal that the gamified flip-class setting fostered better motivation and engagement. Particularly, students motivated to compete and beat other students during the gamification activities by collecting points and badges as many as possible. Four main themes emerged from the qualitative interviews, namely, (1) pre-class learning motivation, (2) pre-class competition, (3) students' learning autonomy, and (4) students' social engagement. Conclusions from this study showed that the gamified flip-class setting had successfully constructed the basic psychological needs of SDT, namely: competency, autonomy, and relatedness.;[Zainuddin, Zamzami] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China;Zainuddin, Z (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;zamzamizain@hku.hk;"Zainuddin, Zamzami/F-1625-2018; Zainuddin, Zamzami/E-8624-2015; Zainuddin, Zamzami/AAB-7135-2021";"Zainuddin, Zamzami/0000-0001-6436-4469; Zainuddin, Zamzami/0000-0002-4851-4102; Zainuddin, Zamzami/0000-0002-4851-4102";NA;NA;NA;61;42;43;15;129;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;NA;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

It has been enthusiastically employed in various fields such as web-based businesses, health, wellness, and has been widely researched in the field of education. While many of the pioneer studies revealed positive effects of gamification for learning, more inconclusive and even negative effects have been reported in subsequent research. It is also uncertain whether the positive outcomes are sustainable and not limited to just novelty effects. Studies in this field continue to mature and the thrust is to move beyond the preliminary and often vague question of Does gamification work? to more specific inquiries like Why does gamification work?, What is gamification's effect? or How to make gamification work? In order for the knowledge gains from research studies to be synthesizable, there has been a call for gamification approaches to be based upon established psychological, behavioural or learning theories instead of ad hoc methods. This paper responds to this need by presenting a gamification framework that is based on the well-established motivational theory, the Self-Determination Theory (SDT). The SDT addresses motivation through the distinction of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. In order to foster authentic learning motivations, gamification should be designed to affect intrinsic motivation for the learning activity itself. This paper outlines how this can be achieved by strategically employing game dynamics and components to meet the psychological needs that support intrinsic motivation.;"[Kam, Adele H.

The SonoGames Organizational Committee designed 2 surveys: 1 for SonoGames V EM resident participants and a second for EM program directors. Survey questions used a 5-point Likert scale to assess overall perceptions and attitudes about ultrasound, changes in self-reported content knowledge and competency, effects on clinical use, and perceived impacts of a competitive game format on education. ResultsConclusionsSeventy-three resident participants and 42 program directors responded to the survey. Ninety-four percent of participants thought that the competitive gaming format of SonoGames was effective in making the event an educational experience. Participants reported that their ultrasound knowledge increased (81%), their enthusiasm for ultrasound increased (87%), and their clinical use of ultrasound increased (61%).

The present study aimed at the designing, implementation, and evaluation of gamification in psychiatric course. Methods: This gamification was developed to design, develop and assess gamification in psychiatric course in 13 parts in the web and android based mobiles. Gamification was developed in 3 dimensions mechanisms, dynamics and components, in 3 phases including design, implementation and evaluation). This gamification was developed for the acquisition of learning goals in nursing and para medical students in mental illness (psychology or psychiatry) using Octaysis 8 core drivers. Gamification arranged in 3 categories included multiple choice, extended matching and case base learning. Evaluation was based on students (quantitative), interview from professors (qualitative) and IT engineers. Results: Data gathering was from interview and questionnaire with 8 items in 5 continuum in order to evaluate students' satisfaction (n=42), teacher evaluation (n=5), and technical evaluation from IT engineers (n-=10). The students reported this software as funny and interesting. Most of them reported the positive effect of gamification on learning (average mean score of items). The teachers also described the software as an efficient tool for achieving students' higher level of learning in psychiatry, funny and innovative method, also a new way to teach psychiatry. IT engineers positively reported the technical characteristics. Most of them reported the positive effect of gamification on learning (average mean score of items). Conclusion: Due to the efficacy of gamification in students' satisfaction and learning indicators, it is suggested that gamification should be used in the design and development of medical course as an innovative, interactive and exciting method.;"[Leilimosalanejad] Jahrom Univ Med Sci, Virtual Learning Ctr, Mental Hlth Dept, Jahrom, Iran; Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Student Res Comm, Shiraz, Iran";Leilimosalanejad (corresponding author), Jahrom Univ Med Sci, Virtual Learning Ctr, Mental Hlth Dept, Jahrom, Iran.;mosallanejad@jums.ac.ir;NA;NA;Jahrom University of Medical Sciences;This study was financed through Research Deputy in Jahrom University of Medical Sciences;NA;49;0;0;0;1;LAHORE MEDICAL & DENTAL COLL;LAHORE;CANAL BANK N, TULSPURA, LAHORE, 00000, PAKISTAN;1996-7195;NA;NA;PAK J MED HEALTH SCI;Pak.

This is evident in different application context, mainly in the entertainment industry. however, there is evidence of the increment of using VG in others contexts like rehabilitation, health and education. Specifically, this proposal is focused on the educational field, where new technologies are daily used by the student. And, we considered that traditional methodologies need to adapt their methods with these technologies. our proposal is centered in to answer How we currently take advantage of this and how we can improve them? That is why, first, we did a literature review that aims to find the main features and methods that are been used in the education through virtual reality implementation.

By the use of a formative research, called design based research (DBR), a naturalistic case post factum was analyzed, in order to contribute to the improvement of the original design proposed for the course. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected in a pilot class that had 54 students enrolled. The results indicate that the combination of the two types of gamification, based on different theoretical foundations, can contribute to increase student engagement in online learning courses and to provide opportunities to transpose into practice what was theoretically discussed in the course curriculum.;"[Cavalcanti, Carolina Costa] FDC, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Cavalcanti, Carolina Costa] Ctr Univ Adventista Sao Paulo UNASP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Filatro, Andrea] Ctr Univ Adventista Sao Paulo UNASP, Design Instruc, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Presada, William Andrew] FIA, MBA Int, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil";"Cavalcanti, CC (corresponding author), FDC, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.; Cavalcanti, CC (corresponding author), Ctr Univ Adventista Sao Paulo UNASP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.";"carolinacavalcanti.ead@gmail.com; afilatro@uol.com.br; bill@bikebrasil.com.br";Filatro, Andrea C/B-2989-2015;"Filatro, Andrea/0000-0002-9503-7863; Costa Cavalcanti, Carolina/0000-0003-4234-9377";Education and Design research group at UNASP Campus Virtual, Brazil;This research was support by Education and Design research group at UNASP Campus Virtual, Brazil.

To examine the major considerations undergirding the design of digital badges used in an educational context, a conceptual literature review of multidisciplinary electronic databases oriented towards computing and education was undertaken. The three core design dimensions found in our analysis were the specific function of badges, the structure of badge systems, and the different types of design and interaction features used with badges.

At the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, anatomy teaching has traditionally been delivered via didactic means. To encourage more active learning, suitable games (non-digital) and the script concordance test were utilized to enhance the process. The flipped classroom approach was also introduced to further trigger active learning. In addition, the use of mobile apps (digital) was also initiated as supplements for SDL. Feedback was collected based on the previously validated PRO-SDL scale. Results from the research yielded inconclusive evidence to support enhanced motivation among our students due to gamification (P > 0.05). However, it did help to encourage active participation for a fun learning experience supported by numerous positive comments. More importantly, the participant's continuous assessment (CA1, CA2, and CA3) and objective specific practical exam results were better than the cohort's average (P < 0.05), suggesting that enhanced meta-cognition, and factual recall had taken place. While it is positive, there are some caveats to note with gamification, first and foremost, that it is tutor dependent. Taken together, gamification could represent a new paradigm for anatomy education, and also an opportune time to change the prevailing culture in the healthcare and education industry. Clin.

However, empirical studies have reported several problems that may occur with flipped classroom activities, including the failure of students to access out-of-class learning materials. Students who do not complete out-of-class work benefit little from the subsequent in-class discussion and problem-solving activities. This study offers a new contribution by exploring whether gamification could be a strategy to motivate students to participate in more out-of-class activities without forfeiting quality of work. We applied crucial aspects of five motivation theories to propose a goal-access-feedback-challenge-collaboration (GAFCC) gamification design model. We then implemented and tested this theory-driven model in two quasi-experimental studies involving postgraduate students. Collective results from the two experiments revealed that (a) the GAFCC class completed significantly more pre- and post class activities than the control class and (b) the GAFCC class produced higher quality work than the control class. Participants' perceptions of gamification were also collected through interviews, and reported in this study. This evidence supports a call for further research into the use of the GAFCC model in flipped classroom implementation.;"[Huang, Biyun; Hew, Khe Foon] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Div Informat & Technol Studies, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China";Huang, BY (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Div Informat & Technol Studies, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;"lucy99@connect.hku.hk; kfhew@hku.hk";"Hew, Khe/ABB-1737-2020; Huang, Lucy/ABA-6040-2020";"Hew, Khe/0000-0003-4149-533X;";NA;NA;NA;62;27;27;9;96;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;NA;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

These interactive learning environments present the opportunity to evolve the teaching process through the incorporation of game elements that have been shown to capture user attention, motivate towards goals, and promote competition, effective teamwork, and communication. Gamification and game-based learning systems aim to bring these benefits into the learning and teaching process. This paper presents a systematic literature review of game-based learning systems, frameworks that integrate game design elements, and various implementations of gamification in higher education. A systematic search of databases was conducted to select articles related to gamification in education for this review. The objective is to identify how gamified learning systems can be used and categorize its usefulness in higher education.

Overall, we found positive trends with respect to students' perceptions of gamification's impact on their learning, achievement, and engagement in the course material. Although students who played and identified variously with recreational games were more alike than not, we did uncover one notable difference with respect to how students' gaming frequency impacted their engagement in the course. Nongamers expressed somewhat less motivation to do well in the course than frequent gamers. For all other measures of engagement, however, nongamers appeared to be equally engaged by the gamified format of the course as gamers. There were virtually no differences between male and female students' perceptions of gamification.

By focusing on the learning effort, this system can easily and quickly determine whether learners have exerted the minimum effort required for learning. To do this, the system automatically generates a word game and determines whether minimum learning has taken place through the results of the word game. To verify the minimum learning judgment system, we conducted a comparative experiment on the importance of high-frequency words, a word count verification test for word games, and a judgment criteria verification test based on the length of a video lecture. Results of the experiments show that high-frequency words can be used as a feature to determine minimum learning. The appropriate number of words in the word game for the minimum learning judgment was found to be seven, and the results showed that the video length did not affect the minimum learning criteria. In addition, the minimum learning judgment accuracy result was 82%.

An innovative burn prevention intervention was developed using these channels. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Cool Runnings, an app- based intervention to increase knowledge of childhood burn risk (specifically hot beverage scalds) and correct burn first aid among mothers of young children. Methods: This was a 2-group, parallel, single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants were women aged 18 years and above, living in Queensland, Australia, with at least 1 child aged 5-12 months at time of enrollment. The primary outcome measures were change in knowledge about risk of burns and correct burn first aid assessed via 2 methods: (1) overall score and (2) categorized as adequate (score=4) versus inadequate (score<4). Efficacy of gamification techniques was also assessed. Results: In total, 498 participants were recruited via social media and enrolled. At the 6-month follow-up, 244 participants completed the posttest questionnaire. Attrition rates in both groups were similar. Participants who remained in the study did not differ from those lost to follow-up on any characteristics except education level. Although similar at baseline, intervention group participants achieved significantly greater improvement in overall knowledge posttest than control group participants on both primary outcome measures (overall knowledge intervention: mean [SD] of overall knowledge 2.68 [SD 1.00] for intervention vs 2.13 [SD 1.03] for control; 20.7% [25/121] adequate in intervention vs 7.3% [2/123] in control). Consequently, the number needed to treat was 7.46. Logistic regression showed participants exposed to the highest level of disadvantage had 7.3 times higher odds of improved overall knowledge scores than participants in other levels of disadvantage. There were also significant correlations between gamification techniques and knowledge change (P<.001). In addition, odds of knowledge improvement between baseline and 6-month follow-up was higher in participants with low-moderate app activity compared with no app activity (odds ratio [OR] 8.59, 95% CI 2.9-25.02) and much higher in participants with high app activity (OR 18.26, 95% CI 7.1-46.8). Conclusions: Despite substantial loss to follow-up, this RCT demonstrates the Cool Runnings app was an effective intervention for improving knowledge about risks of hot beverage scalds and burn first aid in mothers of young children. The benefits of combining gamification elements in the intervention were also highlighted. Given the low cost and large reach of smartphone apps to deliver content to and engage with targeted populations, the results from this RCT provide important information on how smartphone apps can be used for widespread injury prevention campaigns and public health campaigns generally.";"[Burgess, Jacqueline] Univ Queensland, Ctr Childrens Burns & Trauma Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Burgess, Jacqueline; Kimble, Roy M.] Lady Cilento Childens Hosp, Pegg Leditschke Childrens Burns Ctr, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Burgess, Jacqueline] Wound Management Innovat Cooperat Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Watt, Kerrianne] James Cook Univ, Coll Publ Hlth Med & Vet Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Kimble, Roy M.] Lady Cilento Childrens Hosp, Dept Paediat Surg, Urol Burns & Trauma Unit, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Cameron, Cate M.] Royal Brisbane & Womens Hosp, Metro North Hosp & Hlth Serv Dist, Jamieson Trauma Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Cameron, Cate M.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Publ Hlth & Social Work, Brisbane, Qld, Australia";Burgess, J (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Childrens Burns & Trauma Res, Child Hlth Res Ctr, 62 Graham St, Brisbane, Qld 4021, Australia.;jacquii@uq.edu.au;NA;Cameron, Cate/0000-0003-1476-5744;Australian Government's Cooperative Research Center's ProgramAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme;JB would like to acknowledge the support of the Australian Government's Cooperative Research Center's Program.

However, the automatic generation of these tasks can be unfeasible due to the high-order search space for the possible combinations of tasks; this complexity increases when considering the possible constraints as well as adapting the tasks to the individual characteristics of each student. This paper presents a new method to automatically generate teaching matching-to-sample tasks, adapting the difficulty by using bio-inspired optimization metaheuristics. Genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, and integer and categorical particle swarm optimization were evaluated to determine their stability and capacity to generate adapted tasks. A comparison of the results between the algorithms showed a better rate of convergence for the genetic algorithms, which were able to generate tasks at an adapted level of difficulty to students. These tasks were applied to a group of students at a Brazilian public school in the early stages of a literacy course indicating satisfactory effects in the individual learning process.";"[de Souza, Gilberto Nerino, Jr.; de Deus, Daniel Felipe; Tadaiesky, Vincent; de Araujo, Igor Meireles; Monteiro, Dionne Cavalcante; de Santana, Adamo Lima] Fed Univ Para, R Augusto Correa 01, BR-66075110 Belem, PA, Brazil";de Souza, GN (corresponding author), Fed Univ Para, R Augusto Correa 01, BR-66075110 Belem, PA, Brazil.;"gilbertonerinojr@gmail.com; danielfdeus@gmail.com; vincentwillian@gmail.com; igor.araujo92@gmail.com; dionne@ufpa.br; adamo@ufpa.br";Meireles de Araujo, Igor/AAC-9968-2019;Meireles de Araujo, Igor/0000-0002-8238-6597;Brazilian Agency for the Support and Evaluation of Post-Graduate Education (PGPTA) [59/2014];We would like to express our thanks to the team from the Edson Luis School for their assistance in teaching matters, in particular Mrs. Sandra Nazare Parente de Oliveira.

Scholars hold that migration can be considered as a switching of people's place of residence, but the migration of people is not limited to the migration of residence. The marketing field also borrows the population migration theory to further explore the switching behavior of customers; educationalists also discuss migration of learning through migration theory. In this regard, the migration of human beings is a process of historical evolution, though it takes several decades to understand history from the perspective of such evolution. Hence, if there is a decision-making system that simulates evolution and estimation through 3D graphics, then players may better understand the impact of environmental migration and changes on humanity. This study adopts Push-Pull-Mooring (PPM) theory to explain the migration of human beings. Push is generated from people's dissatisfaction with their place of residence, Pull is from attractions of the new environment, and personal mooring produces the intention of switching. A set of Gamification Environmental Education Applications (GEEA) and a migration scale for such apps are developed herein to explain the state where computer gamers switch to mobile app games. The results show that all four hypotheses are supported, and the path coefficient of each hypothesis is highly significant. The R-2 values of five intrinsic constructs are Push (R-2 = 0.321), Mooring (R-2 = 0.574), Pull (R-2 = 0.413), Switching intention (SI) (R-2 = 0.552), and SB (R-2 = 0.626), where the R-2 value of SB is quite high, indicating that the relationship between the switching behavior (SB) and the four precursors exhibits great explanatory power. Hence, the explanatory power of this model is convincing, and the teaching materials designed through gamification education deliver better learning outcomes.";[Su, Chung-Ho] Shu Te Univ, Dept Animat & Game Design, Kaohsiung 824, Taiwan;Su, CH (corresponding author), Shu Te Univ, Dept Animat & Game Design, Kaohsiung 824, Taiwan.;mic6033@stu.edu.tw;NA;su, chungho/0000-0001-9919-8579;Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 107-2637-H-366-002-];The authors would like to thanks the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan under Contract No. MOST 107-2637-H-366-002-.;NA;84;9;9;4;23;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;NA;2071-1050;NA;SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL;Sustainability;OCT;2018;10;10;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;3363;10.3390/su10103363;NA;NA;26;"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies";"Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology";GY4UB;WOS:000448559400005;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Since these algorithms are complex, there is a need for a system which would enable their application both in everyday work and education processes. This paper describes a software system for learning AI algorithms called SAIL (Software System for AI Learning), which can be used both on computers and mobile devices. The paper gives examples of lab exercises and self-study tasks that through graphic representation and detailed procedures help students master this area. Students can enter their examples into the system and obtain correct solutions for those examples. At any point when an example is simulated, a student can proceed to the next step or go back to the previous one, save the current simulation as a file, or print the detailed procedure as a task solution. SAIL helps lecturers go through the syllabus more efficiently and improve class material, while at the same time it helps students get a better grasp of implemented algorithms. SAIL can also benefit software engineers, who can select and simulate an adequate algorithm to solve a specific problem. The results of the SAIL system are verified within the AI introductory course at the School of Electrical Engineering University of Belgrade and they are presented in this paper.;"[Draskovic, Drazen; Cvetanovic, Milos; Nikolic, Bosko] Univ Belgrade, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Comp Engn & Informat, Belgrade, Serbia";Draskovic, D (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Comp Engn & Informat, Belgrade, Serbia.;drazen.draskovic@etf.bg.ac.rs;"Cvetanovic, Milos/AAO-5296-2020; Draskovic, Drazen/U-1113-2018";"Draskovic, Drazen/0000-0003-2564-4526; Nikolic, Bosko/0000-0003-1142-9243";NA;NA;NA;33;1;1;1;30;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;NA;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

It is in this context that students use a variety of practices to prepare assessments and exams appropriately. On the other hand, in recent years, higher education institutions have been using the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as an alternative to expand and innovate their traditional classroom practices. In this field, some alternatives have been generated in these platforms to extend their functions beyond the courses proposed. MyMOOCSpace is a cloud-based tool that improves the interaction of students participating in a MOOC course. However, a variation of this tool allows for improved collaboration and preparation of assessments and/or tests for students in a traditional higher education class. This article presents a study using the MyMOOCSpace tool as an alternative to encourage collaboration and preparation of students to take traditional tests or assessments in the field of higher education. To evaluate this application and demonstrate the impact on the results of the evaluations, a case study is presented in which 40 computer engineering students from a Chilean university participated. The results show that MyMOOCSpace generates a positive increase in student interaction regarding the subjects covered in the course, and that it helped them to study and prepare for the final exam of the subject.;"[Ramirez-Donoso, Luis; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar; Neyem, Andres] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Ramirez-Donoso, Luis] Univ Bernardo OHiggins, FICT, Santiago, Chile; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Paul Sabatier Toulouse III, Inst Rech Informat Toulouse, Toulouse, France";Ramirez-Donoso, L (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, DCC, Santiago, Chile.;llramirez@uc.cl;Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014;Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963;"Scholarship of Universidad Bernardo O' Higgins in Santiago de Chile [1000/532/14]; Corfo Project 2030 [14ENI2-26862]; MOOCMaker [561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; ConicytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [21161264]";"Scholarship of Universidad Bernardo O' Higgins in Santiago de Chile, Grant number: UBO' H Rect.

This study held an understanding sequence for 20 classes during the 7-week automation equipment class with 30s year high school students in Incheon's specialized technical high school as target. After the class, the learning attitude of learners was measured through surveys and in-depth interviews. As a result, first, it was found that the degree of preparation participation in flip learning using gaming elements had a statistically significant increase from 65.56% to 78.89%, compared with the traditional flip learning using YouTube. Second, comparing the academic achievements showed a diagnostic assessment of 57.44 before applying the gaming elements and 20.17 after the application. However, for summative assessment, the degree after applying gaming elements was statistically higher at 84.52 than the degree before application, which was 78.86. Third, comparing academic achievement with word game results showed no significant correlation, and it is judged that all students were able to enjoy word games, regardless of their grades. Also, when the average word game scores were compared based on students' grades, mid-upper level students had statistically significant higher scores than upper level students. Lastly, analysis on the correlation between attitude and word game showed that there is a quantitatively high correlation between the ranking system's competitive spirit and interest.

This study investigates the extent to which game-based learning (GBL) and gamification could improve the sexual health education of adolescent students. We conducted a randomized control trial of GBL and gamification experimental conditions. We made a comparison with traditional teaching as a control condition in order to establish differences between the three teaching conditions. The sexual health education topics were delivered in a masked fashion, 40-min a week for five weeks. A mixed-method research approach was uses to assess and analyze the results for 120 students from a secondary school in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. Students were divided into groups of 40 for each of the three teaching methods: GBL, gamification, and the control group (the traditional teaching method). The average post-test scores for GBL (Mean = 79.94, SD = 11.169) and gamification (Mean = 79.23, SD = 9.186) were significantly higher than the control group Mean = 51.93, SD = 18.705 (F (2, 117) = 54.75, p = 0.001). Overall, statistically significant differences (p 0.05) were found for the constructs of Motivation, Attitude, Knowledge, and Engagement (MAKE). This study suggests that the two innovative teaching approaches can be used to improve the sexual health education of adolescent students. The methods can potentially contribute socially, particularly in improving sexual health behaviour and adolescents' knowledge in regions plagued by years of sexual health problems, including HIV/AIDS.;"[Haruna, Hussein; Hu, Xiao; Chu, Samuel Kai Wah; Mellecker, Robin R.] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Gabriel, Goodluck] Innovat Dev Tanzania, Animat Creat Dept, 63 Galu St, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Ndekao, Patrick Siril] Inst Finance Management, Directorate Lib Serv, 5 Shaaban Robert St, Dar Es Salaam 11101, Tanzania";Haruna, H (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;"hharuna@hku.hk; xiaoxhu@hku.hk; samchu@hku.hk; robmel@hku.hk; goodluckgabriel201@gmail.com; cyrilbab@gmail.com";Hussein, Haruna/AAG-8663-2020;"Hussein, Haruna/0000-0001-9089-2847; Hu, Xiao/0000-0003-3994-0385";NA;NA;NA;92;10;12;2;17;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;1661-7827;1660-4601;NA;INT J ENV RES PUB HE;Int.

Thus, the overriding purpose of the study was to provide a diagnostic insight into how different factors come into play in the context of best practices of e-learning. The research aimed to help build a robust approach to the phenomenon. A dominant quantitative and less dominant qualitative method using survey approach was adopted. A total of 2,718 undergraduate students of the School of Social Sciences at two campuses of the University of KwaZulu-Natal, UKZN, South Africa participated in the survey. The theoretical framework adopted to underpin the research was the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology Model (UTAUT). The findings identified the criticality of factors such as perceived ease of use, complexity, ease of use, attitude, subjective norm, social factors and image to best practices of e-learning. The significance of the study has the potential to impact on the policy, implementation and best practices of e-learning. Theoretically, the context of South Africa in contrast to early adopter countries was employed to advance the frontiers of global knowledge and improve an understanding of the UTAUT model to explain e-learning best practices.;[Olasina, Gbolahan] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Social Sci, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa;Olasina, G (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Social Sci, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.;OlasinaG@ukzn.ac.za;Olasina, Gbolahan/V-4162-2019;Olasina, Gbolahan/0000-0002-5732-110X;NA;NA;NA;99;3;3;0;13;LABORATORY KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT & E-LEARNING UNIV;HONG KONG;RM 212, RUNME SHAW BLDG, FAC EDUCATION, UNIV HONG KONG, HONG KONG, 00000, HONG KONG;2073-7904;NA;NA;KNOWL MANAG E-LEARN;Knowl.

But who are these students? This paper explores the features of students who are interested in using digital badges as a motivational reward to prepare for weekly face-to-face classes through engaging with online activities and resources. This paper uses a first-year undergraduate Bachelor of Nursing bioscience topic at an Australian university to report nursing students' interests around playing games, their digital badge history during the topic, and their self-reported attitudinal interest in using digital badges to enhance and personalise their learning. Overall, the results indicate that some students chose to enhance their learning potential in class by earning digital badges prior to class. The results of this paper are relevant for nursing educators and educational designers seeking to integrate digital badges into motivational teaching practices, by evaluating the role digital badges play as a motivational game-based learning design element.;"[Garnett, Timna] Flinders Univ S Australia, Ctr Innovat Learning & Teaching, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Button, Didy] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia";Garnett, T (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Ctr Innovat Learning & Teaching, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.;"timna.garnett@flinders.edu.au; didy.button@flinders.edu.au";NA;"Button, Didy/0000-0001-8883-0081; Garnett, Timna/0000-0002-2441-2128";NA;NA;NA;32;7;7;2;17;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;1471-5953;NA;NA;NURSE EDUC PRACT;Nurse Educ.

Practical software development courses and projects are inherently motivating to students, as they provide necessary elements such as agency, relatedness, and the strong sense of competence upon completing software engineering tasks. In contrast, reading research articles and technical white papers feels dry and non-engaging. Nevertheless, a well-balanced MSc programme curriculum covers both, learning through construction and practical courses as well as research courses. The main motivation for the development of game-centric approaches to the research aspects of curriculum is to improve students' interest and engagement with those courses. In this paper, we present the methodology and initial evaluations from three gamification strategies used in the Master's degree programme. These are: the game of reading and discussing research articles (GoRaD), the game of arguing and counter-arguing, and combining research and practice.

The comparison of learning achievements between these learning sessions and standard classes revealed increased students' learning performance on comparable topics. To understand the reason for improvement, we have surveyed students after each session and tested the gathered data set via the development of a structural equation model that examines the relationships between student's personality traits, motivation and experience with learning outcomes. The findings show that students' achievements were directly influenced by students' intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors, as well as perceived experience. Additionally, the integration of traditional games in the elementary school classroom was equally accepted among all students, since their personality traits did not directly influence their experience or learning outcomes. Still, the link between the students' personality dimensions and motivation revealed that introvert children might have slightly increased motivation and possibility to open up during game-play in such collaborative environments.;"[Trajkovik, Vladimir; Vasileva-Stojanovska, Tatjana; Vasileva, Marina] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Comp Sci & Engn, Skopje, Macedonia; [Malinovski, Toni] FON Univ, Fac Informat & Commun Technol, Skopje, Macedonia";Malinovski, T (corresponding author), FON Univ, Fac Informat & Commun Technol, Skopje, Macedonia.;toni.malinovski@fon.edu.mk;Trajkovik, Vladimir/K-9758-2019;Malinovski, Toni/0000-0002-7876-0953;NA;NA;NA;88;6;6;2;18;PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE;SAN FRANCISCO;1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA;1932-6203;NA;NA;PLOS ONE;PLoS One;AUG 20;2018;13;8;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;e0202172;10.1371/journal.pone.0202172;NA;NA;15;Multidisciplinary Sciences;Science & Technology - Other Topics;GR0JS;WOS:000442202100019;30125300;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Despite the demand to improve residency education on value-based, cost-conscious healthcare, there is no consensus on how to best teach this practice. Traditional lectures have failed to demonstrate enduring change in clinical practice patterns, provider attitudes, and reductions in hospital expenditures. We sought to evaluate whether gamification is an effective pedagogical tool to teach cost-consciousness to emergency medicine (EM) residents by creating a 60-minute interactive session based on the popular gameshow, the Price is Right. Costs and associated charges for common laboratory tests, radiographic studies, medications, and common physical resources typically found in the emergency department (ED) were first obtained through direct communication with the ED clinical director and hospital leadership. The session itself consisted of three phases with several Price-is-Right-themed games, which included realistic visual stimuli reminiscent of the gameshow that were created by the authors using the PowerPoint. Formal quantitative and qualitative feedback was solicited at the end of the session. Quantitative evaluation of the educational intervention was obtained through a 22-item questionnaire using a five-point Likert-type scale from 19 of the 22 enrolled residents (86% response rate). Responses were generally very positive with an overall course rating score of 4.16 (SD +/- 0.90). Qualitative feedback identified learners' predilection for gamified delivery of nonclinical content during conference. The majority of residents (89%) recommend the activity to be used in subsequent offerings to other learners. With healthcare costs on the rise, our feasibility study demonstrated that gamification is an effective way to teach mindful, cost-conscious care to EM residents. Gamification offers a fun and engaging alternative that should be further utilized in EM educational formats. Future studies are needed to longitudinally assess the learner retention and cost-containment practices.;"[Tomaselli, Peter J.; Papanagnou, Dimitrios; Zhang, Xiao Chi] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Karademos, Jonathan E.] Thomas Jefferson Univ Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Teixeira, Elizabeth] Thomas Je, Dept Emergency Med, Philadelphia, PA USA";Zhang, XC (corresponding author), Thomas Jefferson Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.;xzhang09@gmail.com;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;11;0;0;0;1;CUREUS INC;PALO ALTO;PO BOX 61002, PALO ALTO, CA 94306 USA;NA;2168-8184;NA;CUREUS;Cureus;AUG;2018;10;8;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;e3094;10.7759/cureus.3094;NA;NA;11;Medicine, General & Internal;General & Internal Medicine;HB3IL;WOS:000450944400013;30324047;Other Gold, Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Materials and Methods: We delivered a 4-week voluntary undergraduate radiology education program in SL, based on synchronous sessions and asynchronous tasks, with two modalities: introduction to basic radiology for first-cycle (first- to third-year) students and case-based clinical radiology for second-cycle (fourth- to sixth-year) students. Participants completed an evaluation questionnaire about the experiences after the learning program. Results: Forty-six students (20 first-cycle and 26 second-cycle) participated in this study. They found the contents of the course appropriate (mean >= 4.53/5), the initiative interesting, and the environment attractive (mean >= 4.32/5), and they were willing to participate in future SL experiences (mean >= 4.63/5). All students highly rated the organization, the content, the benefit to their medical education, and the professor (mean >= 9.05/10). Conclusion: Online radiology education using SL is feasible and well received by medical students of all year groups. The students participated and engaged in this activity very positively and rated the experience highly. The potential of using SL for radiology education includes promising expectations regarding collaborative learning and gamification.;"[Lorenzo-Alvarez, Rocio; Sendra-Portero, Francisco] Univ Malaga, Fac Med, Dept Radiol & Phys Med, Bvd Luis Pasteur 32, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Pavia-Molina, Jose] Univ Malaga, Fac Med, Dept Pharmacol, Malaga, Spain";Sendra-Portero, F (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, Fac Med, Dept Radiol & Phys Med, Bvd Luis Pasteur 32, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.;sendra@uma.es;"Sendra-Portero, Francisco/AAM-3468-2021; Pavia, Jose/F-5526-2016";"Pavia, Jose/0000-0002-3121-0735; Sendra-Portero, Francisco/0000-0001-9535-9806";University of Malaga [PIE10-128];This work was supported by the University of Malaga (Innovative Education Project PIE10-128).;NA;30;6;6;0;9;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;NEW YORK;360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA;1076-6332;1878-4046;NA;ACAD RADIOL;Acad.

However, there are not many approaches that tackle this in primary school learning environments. The most popular technologies in the classroom are still traditional video consoles and desktop computers, which complicate the design of collaborative activities since they are essentially mono-user. The recent popularization of handheld devices such as tablets and smartphones has made it possible to build affordable, scalable, and improvised collaborative gamifled activities by creating a multi-tablet environment. In this paper we present Quizbot, a collaborative gamifled quiz application to practice different subjects, which can be defined by educators beforehand. Two versions of the system are implemented: a tactile for tablets laid on a table, in which all the elements are digital; and a tangible in which the tablets are scattered on the floor and the components are both digital and physical objects. Both versions of Quizbot are evaluated and compared in a study with eighty primary-schooled children in terms of user experience and quality of collaboration supported. Results indicate that both versions of Quizbot are essentially equally fun and easy to use, and can effectively support collaboration, with the tangible version outperforming the other one with respect to make the children reach consensus after a discussion, split and parallelize work, and treat each other with more respect, but also presenting a poorer time management.";"[Garcia-Sanjuan, Fernando; Jurdi, Sandra; Jaen, Javier; Nacher, Vicente] Univ Politecn Valencia, DSIC, ISSI Grp, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain";Garcia-Sanjuan, F (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, DSIC, ISSI Grp, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.;"fegarcia@dsic.upv.es; saneljur@dsic.upv.es; fjaen@upv.es; vnacher@dsic.upv.es";Garcia-Sanjuan, Fernando/I-5776-2016;"Garcia-Sanjuan, Fernando/0000-0002-5522-3063; Nacher, Vicente/0000-0003-0623-0731";"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; European Development Regional Fund (EDRF-FEDER) [TIN2014-60077-R]; VALi + d program from Conselleria d'Educacio, Cultura i Esport (Generalitat Valenciana) [ACIF/2014/214]; FPU program from Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sport [FPU14/00136]; Colegio Internacional Ausias March";"This work is supported by Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and funded by the European Development Regional Fund (EDRF-FEDER) with Project TIN2014-60077-R.

Our data, consisting of teachers' documentation, thematic interviews and questionnaires, were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Four main competence areas were identified: pedagogical, technological, collaborative and creative. The results are applicable for developing teacher education and in-service training, as teacher competencies in game-based learning will be more integral to teachers' professional knowledge and skill repertoires.

And can this experience be translated into curriculum engagement? This study describes a 3 week intervention with game-based learning activities in eight lower secondary classrooms (n=190). The intervention combined the use of the co-op action role-playing game Torchlight II and analogue gamification aimed at including 32 students challenged by social difficulties and lack of motivation. The video game was used to create more inclusive classrooms by increasing students' opportunities for participation through collaboration in teams. The students also participated in game-related Danish (L1) and Mathematics activities. Effects on social well-being, learning and motivational patterns were measured through teacher assessment combined with the Children's Perceived Locus of Causality-scales. The results show multidimensional effects including positive impact on at-risk students' well-being and reduced experiences of external regulation to participate in Mathematics and Danish. The qualitative analysis not only confirms the positive findings, but also shows how the intervention created ambiguities surrounding the relationship between game activities and curriculum-related assignments. The findings indicate that the impact of game-based classrooms is not due to their fun element, but rather how they enable reframing of social participation and students' engagement with the curriculum.;"[Hanghoj, Thorkild] Aalborg Univ, Dept Psychol & Commun, Game Based Learning, Aalborg, Denmark; [Lieberoth, Andreas] Aarhus Univ, Interacting Minds Ctr, Aarhus, Denmark; [Lieberoth, Andreas] Danish Sch Educ, Educ Psychol, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Misfeldt, Morten] Aalborg Univ, Dept Learning & Philosophy, Aalborg, Denmark";Hanghoj, T (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Dept Commun & Psychol, AC Meyers Vaenge 15, DK-2450 Copenhagen SV, Denmark.;thorkild@hum.aau.dk;Lieberoth, Andreas/AAO-4518-2020;"Lieberoth, Andreas/0000-0003-0214-5791; Misfeldt, Morten/0000-0002-6481-4121";Egmont Foundation;The authors would like to thank all the teachers, students and research assistants involved in the research project for making this study possible.

However, this does not entail that they know how to learn through digital technologies. Therefore, establishing an interactive virtual learning platform that connects everyone together in a classroom environment and helping learners become familiar with such media might serve a set of purposes in any educational setting. Today, with the advances in web-based learning technologies, a hybrid teaching methodology has become widespread: blended learning. It is a term used to describe the way e-learning is being combined with traditional classroom methods and independent study. Educators design online materials and utilize them in synchronous or asynchronous ways to suit the convenience of learners and instructors and program demands. In this study with a group of intermediate-level English language learners at the School of Foreign Languages of an English-medium state university, the goal was to enhance students' vocabulary learning performance by using synchronous and asynchronous games and activities that will activate and maintain intrinsic motivation in an effort to teach parts of speech and collocations over a period of eight weeks. The data consisted of a survey of students' reflections on their vocabulary learning experiences through digital games and activities.

His model, which was focused on the students' interests, was aligned with the modernized school, in contrast with purely memorization-based education. It thus focused on autonomy and the child's self-management of the entire learning process. The pedagogue found play useful in guiding students towards this educational philosophy. Hence his gamified use of education. Based on the ideas of deschooling and liquid pedagogy, this study reflects on and questions the meaning solely of the child's freedom that Verges promoted based on this environment. Using a methodology based on the analysis of different texts by the pedagogue and his students, we examine the ludic value of the model and study its educational possibilities. The research is based on an in-depth analysis of secondary sources related to way play is treated in education.

In addition, computers and information technology have increased educational opportunities and have opened the way to new teaching/learning approaches. Due to this, several concepts from the e-learning, m-learning and u-learning appeared. Therefore, it is critical to understand whether users (students and professors) are receptive and aware to adapt to this new paradigm before deciding to implement teaching learning methods based on mobile technology. Thus, it is necessary to make a fundamental question How do professors percept m-leaning? In this context, the aim of this paper is to investigate the perception of higher education professors in Portugal and Spain (Iberian Peninsula) regarding the m-learning, and to identify the needs of professors as they relate to mobile technologies and how they can be used to promote student's engagement inside and outside of the classroom.

It is increasingly being used as an adjunct to traditional teaching strategies in medical education to engage the millennial learner and enhance adult learning. The extant literature has focused on determining whether the implementation of gamification results in better learning outcomes, leading to a dearth of research examining its theoretical underpinnings within the medical education context. The authors define gamification, explore how gamification works within the medical education context using self-determination theory as an explanatory mechanism for enhanced engagement and motivation, and discuss common roadblocks and challenges to implementing gamification. Although previous gamification research has largely focused on determining whether implementation of gamification in medical education leads to better learning outcomes, the authors recommend that future research should explore how and under what conditions gamification is likely to be effective. Selective, purposeful gamification that aligns with learning goals has the potential to increase learner motivation and engagement and, ultimately, learning. In line with self-determination theory, game design elements can be used to enhance learners' feelings of relatedness, autonomy, and competence to foster learners' intrinsic motivation. Poorly applied game design elements, however, may undermine these basic psychological needs by the overjustification effect or through negative effects of competition. Educators must, therefore, clearly understand the benefits and pitfalls of gamification in curricular design, take a thoughtful approach when integrating game design elements, and consider the types of learners and overarching learning objectives.;"[Rutledge, Chrystal] Univ Alabama, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Div Pediat Crit Care, Tuscaloosa, AL 35401 USA; [Rutledge, Chrystal] Childrens Alabama Pediat Simulat Ctr, Birmingham, AL USA; [Walsh, Catharine M.] Univ Toronto, Fac Med, Dept Paediat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Walsh, Catharine M.] Hosp Sick Children, Div Gastroenterol Hepatol & Nutr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Walsh, Catharine M.] Wilson Ctr Res Educ, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Swinger, Nathan] Riley Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Auerbach, Marc] Yale Univ, Dept Pediat & Emergency Med, New Haven, CT USA; [Auerbach, Marc] Yale Univ, Yale Ctr Med Simulat, Pediat Simulat, New Haven, CT USA; [Auerbach, Marc] Yale Univ, Sch Med, New Haven, CT USA; [Castro, Danny] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Sect Crit Care Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Dewan, Maya] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Khattab, Mona] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Rake, Alyssa] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Rake, Alyssa] Childrens Hosp, Los Angeles Simulat Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90027 USA; [Rake, Alyssa] Las Madrinas Pediat Simulat Res Lab, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Harwayne-Gidansky, Ilana] Stony Brook Childrens Hosp, Clin Pediat, Stony Brook, NY USA; [Raymond, Tia T.] Med City Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat, Div Cardiac Crit Care, Dallas, TX USA; [Maa, Tensing] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Maa, Tensing] Nationwide Childrens Hosp, Situ Simulat Program, Columbus, OH USA; [Chang, Todd P.] Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Clin Pediat, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Chang, Todd P.] Childrens Hosp Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027 USA";Rutledge, C (corresponding author), 1601 5th Ave S,CPPI Suite 102, Birmingham, AL 35233 USA.;crutledge@peds.uab.edu;"Maa, Tensing/J-9791-2012; Harwayne-Gidansky, Ilana/I-9528-2019; Castro, Danny/J-2450-2019";"Harwayne-Gidansky, Ilana/0000-0001-7987-6440;";NA;NA;NA;53;26;26;1;33;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;1040-2446;1938-808X;NA;ACAD MED;Acad.

This study explores promoting motivation in a distance education, third-year computer programming course via a gamified approach to improve coursework participation and student experience. Motivation was examined from a Self-Determination Theory (SDT) perspective, as gamified approaches often rely on external motivation and the explicit use of competition to engender internal motivation leading to desired behaviours. The results of using gamification in education are mixed, and its use is controversial. Two cycles of action research on the introduction of eight playful elements are reported on, and data relating to student engagement with the course and a student questionnaire was gathered. There was little evidence that the intervention led to behaviour change or improved scores; however, students responded very positively to the intervention, although some negative themes emerged. The extent to which the playful approach supported the basic psychological needs of SDT is discussed and the intervention's results critically considered, including whether the effort involved in such an approach was worth it.

Gamification in software engineering (SE) education is in its infancy. However, as SE educators we are particularly interested in understanding how gamification is pollinating our field and the extent to which the above claim is valid in our context. A systematic literature mapping has underscored the difficulty in fully corroborating the above claim because few empirical data are available so far. However, key trends and challenges have been identified. We found that the purpose of applying gamification in the SE field is mostly directly related to improving student engagement and, to a lesser extent, to improving student knowledge, although other targets are the application of SE best practices and socialization. We have also discussed insightful issues regarding the implementation cost of gamification, patterns in the most often used gamification elements, and the SE processes and teaching activities addressed. Of the identified challenges, we should highlight the complexity of deciding which gamification approach to follow, the lack of information for choosing gamification elements and the need to control the impact of gamification.

However, the pedagogical model used in these courses is frequently being criticized. Many researchers claim the application of active pedagogies in MOOCs in order to improve the student learning processes, as it has been shown in face-to-face courses. Nevertheless, some common features of MOOCs such as the heterogeneity of user profiles, the scale or the asynchronism can hinder the application of these active pedagogies. This paper explores twenty MOOCs, in different languages, platforms and knowledge domains to analyze in detail the current use of collaboration and gamification in such courses. Results show that although there is a trend to promote social interaction, there is a lack of underpinning pedagogical intentions to achieve collaborative outcomes, and when collaboration happens, it is mostly spontaneously, not pursued by the instructional design. Also, results show that gamification is frequently used as a motivational strategy, implemented for rewarding students' individual actions, lacking the recognition of collective achievements. Finally, there is evidence that MOOC platforms are often complemented with additional tools to support student interaction and gamification.;"[Garcia-Sastre, Sara; Idrissi-Cao, Miriam; Ortega-Arranz, Alejandro; Gomez-Sanchez, Eduardo] Univ Valladolid, Fac Educ & Trabajo Social, Dept Pedag, Paseo Belen 1, Valladolid, Spain";Garcia-Sastre, S (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Fac Educ & Trabajo Social, Dept Pedag, Paseo Belen 1, Valladolid, Spain.;"saragar@pdg.uva.es; misicao.miriam@gmail.com; alex@gsic.uva.es; edugom@tel.uva.es";Gomez-Sanchez, Eduardo/C-4274-2013;Gomez-Sanchez, Eduardo/0000-0003-0062-916X;NA;NA;NA;35;2;2;0;23;ASOC IBEROAMERICANA EDUCACION SUPERIOR DISTANCIA;MADRID;UNED, FAC EDUC, C/ JUAN DEL ROSAI, 14, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN;1138-2783;1390-3306;NA;RIED-REV IBEROAM EDU;RIED-Rev.

Interventions that promote healthy sleep, such as those that focus on the dissemination of behavioral and environmental recommendations of sleep hygiene with children, are presented as an alternative. Serious game design offers wide- reaching domains in health applications and is increasing in popularity, particularly with children and teens because of it's potential to engage and motivate players differently from other interventions. This study aims to evaluate effects of serious game on sleep hygiene recommendations Perfect Bedroom: learn to sleep well, on sleep habits and sleep parameters of healthy children. This is an experimental, prospective and quantitative study. We will randomize children in experimental (n = 88) and no intervention groups (n = 88). The experiment has four stages (pre-intervention, intervention, post- intervention, and follow-up), which will count with participation of children and their parents/guardians. In the evaluation stages, the guardians will answer questionnaires and scales to assess sociodemographic and health data, sleep habits and sleep pattern of their child. The children themselves will answer the following: a scale to assess sleepiness levels, a questionnaire to evaluate the serious game and the game itself, will characterize their bedroom and the activities they perform before sleep, with strategies developed by researches. Intervention with experimental group conducted with the serious game Perfect Bedroom will happen twice a week, for 3 weeks in a row, resulting in six sessions of 50 min each. Inferential analysis will be conducted for comparisons between groups and intragroups to measure effect of intervention in primary outcomes (sleep habits) and secondary outcomes (sleep parameters). We expect that the intervention with this game can provide valuable evidence to a new approach in promoting healthy sleep habits, with applications in clinical, educational, and familiar settings, which could diminish future health issues and risk at psychiatric diseases, decreasing the social burden of treatments for these conditions in children.;"[de Almondes, Katie Moraes] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Postgrad Program Psychobiol, Dept Psychol, Natal, RN, Brazil; [de Almondes, Katie Moraes] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Postgrad Program Psychobiol, Postgrad Program, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Leonardo, Maria E.

We present a study of a webbased college-level introductory astronomy class in which content is delivered entirely in a digital world setting through nonplayer characters and built-in minigames. Based on prior research on the potential benefits of video games for use in education, we expect that topics covered in the minigames, the most gamified aspects of the course, should be particularly effective. Using data collected through pre- and posttesting of two sections of ASTRO 001V (the designation given in Penn State's course catalog) with the Test Of Astronomy Standards, we focused our analysis on six questions that pertain directly to minigame topics. We found that two of these questions showed encouraging gains, while the other four demonstrated that students continued to hold on to common alternate conceptions within those topic areas.

The implementation of the gamified course lasted two academic terms. The subsequent evaluation from a cohort of 136 students indicated that student performance was significantly higher among those who participated in the gamified system than in those who engaged with the nongamified, traditional delivery, while behavioral engagement in online learning activities was positively related to course performance, after controlling for gender, attendance, and Year 1 PPD performance. Two interesting phenomena appeared when we examined the influence of student background: female students participated significantly more in online learning activities than male students, and students with jobs engaged significantly more in online learning activities than students without jobs.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of using game mechanics and a student-generated questions strategy to promote algorithmic thinking skills in an online puzzle-based game learning system. An online puzzle-based game learning system, TGTS (Turtle Graphics Tutorial System), was developed to help students learn algorithmic thinking skills by allowing them to solve puzzles. A quasi-experiment was conducted to examine the effectiveness of using game mechanics alone and using game mechanics plus a student generated questions strategy. Nine fourth-grade elementary classes (n = 242) were used to form three treatment groups, including one without game mechanics, one using game mechanics, and one using game mechanics plus a student-generated questions strategy. The results indicate that TGTS with game mechanics significantly enhanced algorithmic thinking skills and puzzle-solving performance. Furthermore, although TGTS with game mechanics plus the student-generated questions strategy is less effective than TGTS with only game mechanics in puzzle solving, it is in fact more effective in enhancing the algorithmic thinking skills. Additionally, this study demonstrated that TGTS with game mechanics plus the student-generated questions strategy can enhance students' engagement experiences and willingness to participate. This study can be a reference for designing learning activities and developing an online puzzle-based game learning system to promote students' learning of algorithmic thinking skills.;"[Hsu, Chih-Chao; Wang, Tzone-I.] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Engn Sci, 1 Daxue Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan";Wang, TI (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Engn Sci, 1 Daxue Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;"n98991077@mail.ncku.edu.tw; wti535@mail.ncku.edu.tw";NA;Hsu, Chih-Chao/0000-0001-9552-1949;NA;NA;NA;103;19;19;16;114;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;NA;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

It involves a large group of people solving a problem or completing a task for an individual or, more commonly, for an organisation. While the field of crowdsourcing has developed more quickly in information technology, it has great promise in health applications. This review examines uses of crowdsourcing in global health and health, broadly. Methods Semantic searches were run in Google Scholar for crowdsourcing, crowdsourcing and health, and similar terms. 996 articles were retrieved and all abstracts were scanned. 285 articles related to health. This review provides a narrative overview of the articles identified. Results Eight areas where crowdsourcing has been used in health were identified: diagnosis; surveillance; nutrition; public health and environment; education; genetics; psychology; and, general medicine/other. Many studies reported crowdsourcing being used in a diagnostic or surveillance capacity. Crowdsourcing has been widely used across medical disciplines; however, it is important for future work using crowdsourcing to consider the appropriateness of the crowd being used to ensure the crowd is capable and has the adequate knowledge for the task at hand. Gamification of tasks seems to improve accuracy; other innovative methods of analysis including introducing thresholds and measures of trustworthiness should be considered. Conclusion Crowdsourcing is a new field that has been widely used and is innovative and adaptable. With the exception of surveillance applications that are used in emergency and disaster situations, most uses of crowdsourcing have only been used as pilots. These exceptions demonstrate that it is possible to take crowdsourcing applications to scale. Crowdsourcing has the potential to provide more accessible health care to more communities and individuals rapidly and to lower costs of care.";[Wazny, Kerri] Univ Edinburgh, Usher Inst Informat & Populat Sci, Ctr Global Hlth Res, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland;Wazny, K (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Usher Inst Informat & Populat Sci, Ctr Global Hlth Res, Old Med Sch, Teviot Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9AG, Midlothian, Scotland.;kerri.wazny@ed.ac.uk;Wazny, Kerri/U-3918-2019;NA;NA;NA;NA;93;25;25;0;22;UNIV EDINBURGH, GLOBAL HEALTH SOC;EDINBURGH;CENTRE POPULATION HEALTH SCIENCES, OLD MEDICAL SCH, TEVIOT PL, EDINBURGH, EH8 9AG, SCOTLAND;2047-2978;2047-2986;NA;J GLOB HEALTH;J.

Recent publications on gamification in the classroom investigate the concept of meaningful gamification, where, in line with Ryan and Deci's self-determination theory, competency, autonomy, and relatedness are prioritized. The paradigm of meaningful gamification works well as a catalyst in motivating students to read background material and grasp key concepts that facilitate a flipped classroom. This study measures the impact of meaningful gaming on students' motivation in a higher education setting.

Owing to the fact that the group of students chosen for the study consisted of pre-service grade school teachers, their opinions on the use of the Wiki environment along with its embedded gamification elements in their future careers have been sought. Of particular interest were the considerations of pre-service teachers concerning the age levels of a target audience that they believed would benefit from instruction with this particular educational tool. Following a mixed-research methodological pattern, the study was conducted in two consecutive stages. The first stage involved a quasi-experiment and the second was handled as a case study. In order to examine the long-term effects of Wild activities supported by gamification elements on student academic success, a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical test was conducted based on scores from an initial pre-knowledge test, an applied interim examination, and a final examination. In order to determine the opinions of teacher candidates regarding Wild activities and the process of gamification, results from an open-ended questionnaire were consulted. It was eventually discovered that students in both the Wild-only (p = 0.02) and gamified-Wiki (p = 0.00) activity groups displayed significantly greater academic success compared to a control group. Although gamification elements also caused a significant difference between the two Wiki groups in terms of the number of times content is displayed (1670 > 637) and edited (38 > 18), it was observed that participation rates fell over time in both groups. As for academic success, there was no difference between the two Wiki groups (p = 0.92). It was found that teacher candidates regard Wiki and gamification activities positively. Also, it was noted that they did not possess an adequate level of consciousness of the fact that student capabilities are an important factor in making effective use of technology.

Computer game users are actually players that are categorized according to their personalities and have different learning styles. To achieve maximum performance in designing gamified learning one can determine the relationship between player types and their learning styles, and then use this relationship to design better gamification in the field of education. In this research, the relationship between types of p layers based on Hexad scale model and the dimensions of Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM) have been investigated. To this end, the research data were collected from 121 university students.

MS-related symptoms impact negatively on the quality of life of persons with MS, who need to be active in the management of their health. mHealth apps could support these patient groups by offering useful tools, providing reliable information, and monitoring symptoms. A previous study from this group identified needs, barriers, and facilitators for the use of mHealth solutions among persons with MS. It is unknown how commercially available health apps meet these needs. Objective: The main objective of this review was to assess how the features present in MS apps meet the reported needs of persons with MS. Methods: We followed a combination of scoping review methodology and systematic assessment of features and content of mHealth apps. A search strategy was defined for the two most popular app stores (Google Play and Apple App Store) to identify relevant apps. Reviewers independently conducted a screening process to filter apps according to the selection criteria. Interrater reliability was assessed through the Fleiss-Cohen coefficient (k=.885). Data from the included MS apps were extracted and explored according to classification criteria. Results: An initial total of 581 potentially relevant apps was found. After removing duplicates and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 30 unique apps were included in the study. A similar number of apps was found in both stores. The majority of the apps dealt with disease management and disease and treatment information. Most apps were developed by small and medium-sized enterprises, followed by pharmaceutical companies. Patient education and personal data management were among the most frequently included features in these apps. Energy management and remote monitoring were often not present in MS apps. Very few contained gamification elements. Conclusions: Currently available MS apps fail to meet the needs and demands of persons with MS. There is a need for health professionals, researchers, and industry partners to collaborate in the design of mHealth solutions for persons with MS to increase adoption and engagement.;"[Giunti, Guido] Salumedia Tecnol, Avda Republ Argentina 24, Seville 41011, Spain; [Giunti, Guido] Univ Oulu, Oulu, Finland; [Guisado Fernandez, Estefania] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Dorronzoro Zubiete, Enrique; Rivera Romero, Octavio] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain";Giunti, G (corresponding author), Salumedia Tecnol, Avda Republ Argentina 24, Seville 41011, Spain.;drguidogiunti@gmail.com;"Rivera, Octavio/I-5281-2017; Giunti, Guido/P-4460-2016";"Giunti, Guido/0000-0003-0836-9825; Rivera Romero, Octavio/0000-0001-7212-9805";"Horizon Framework Programme of the European Commission [676201]; V Plan Propio de Investigacion de la Universidad de Sevilla, Spain";"GG and EG-F gratefully acknowledge a grant (#676201) for the Connected Health Early-Stage Researcher Support System (CHESS ITN) from the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Commission.; ED-Z receives funding and is supported by the V Plan Propio de Investigacion de la Universidad de Sevilla, Spain.";NA;56;17;17;0;16;JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC;TORONTO;130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA;2291-5222;NA;NA;JMIR MHEALTH UHEALTH;JMIR mHealth uHealth;MAY;2018;6;5;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;e10512;10.2196/10512;NA;NA;14;"Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics";"Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics";GH6WZ;WOS:000433586100001;29792295;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

As a result, nursing students' performance in administering medication facilitated by technology is often poor. Serious gaming has been recommended as a possible intervention to improve nursing students' performance with electronic medication administration in nursing education. Objective: The objectives of this study are to examine whether the use of a gamified electronic medication administration simulator (1) improves nursing students' attention to medication administration safety within simulated practice, (2) increases student self-efficacy and knowledge of the medication administration process, and (3) improves motivational and cognitive processing attributes related to student learning in a technology-enabled environment. Methods: This study comprised the development of a gamified electronic medication administration record simulator and its evaluation in 2 phases. Phase 1 consists of a prospective, pragmatic randomized controlled trial with second-year baccalaureate nursing students at a Canadian university. Phase 2 consists of qualitative focus group interviews with a cross-section of nursing student participants. Results: The gamified medication administration simulator has been developed, and data collection is currently under way. Conclusions: If the gamified electronic medication administration simulator is found to be effective, it could be used to support other health professional simulated education and scaled more widely in nursing education programs.;"[Booth, Richard; Sinclair, Barbara; Chan, Ryan; Brennan, Laura] Western Univ, Arthur Labatt Family Sch Nursing, Fac Hlth Sci, 1151 Richmond St,FIMS & Nursing Bldg,Room 2333, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [McMurray, Josephine] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Business Technol Management Hlth Studies, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Strudwick, Gillian] Ctr Addict & Mental Hlth, Informat Management Grp, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Watson, Gavan] Western Univ, Teaching Support Ctr, London, ON, Canada; [Ladak, Hanif] Western Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Med Biophys, London, ON, Canada; [Zwarenstein, Merrick] Western Univ, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, Ctr Studies Family Med, London, ON, Canada; [McBride, Susan] Texas Tech Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Sch Nursing, Lubbock, TX 79430 USA";Booth, R (corresponding author), Western Univ, Arthur Labatt Family Sch Nursing, Fac Hlth Sci, 1151 Richmond St,FIMS & Nursing Bldg,Room 2333, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.;rbooth6@uwo.ca;"Zwarenstein, Merrick F/P-5210-2014; McMurray, Josephine/AAU-6074-2020";"Zwarenstein, Merrick F/0000-0003-0162-7027; McMurray, Josephine/0000-0002-5607-3781; Watson, Gavan/0000-0003-0397-2334";eCampusOntario Research Grant [RI-WEST03];This work was funded by an eCampusOntario (#RI-WEST03) Research Grant (2017-2018).

The purpose of the study was to identify the nature of the impact of time management on students' health status and the quality of their lives and to determine the possibility of using time management to improve them. It took place in three phases during 2016-2017. The students of the Russian State Social University (81 respondents) took part in the study. The developed methodology included a system of methods and approaches. The empirical base was made up of data obtained through surveys, focus groups, timing. As a result, it was found that 42% of students were ill during the past year, and in the last five years, health worsened in 60% of the respondents. Factors that adversely affect health: stress from learning conditions, malnutrition, overwork and physical fatigue. As a universal tool, time management was proposed. Optimization of time management was different for organized students from the unorganized. Organized students focused on increasing the time for sports, proper nutrition, timely visits to the doctor. Unorganized students could not do this and realized that their quality of life was unsatisfactory. All students positively assessed the possibility of time management, which served as the basis for working on themselves, improving their health and quality of life.

The research results give insights into the profiles of the teachers who use or do not use gamification during their classes, and identify gamification mechanics and applications they employ. Teachers' opinions about the gamification and the reasons for (not) introducing it into the class are also presented. According to the research results, it is possible to conclude that less than half of the respondents were familiar with the concept of gamification and that they applied it in their work. The research results show that most of the teachers got acknowledged with the concept of gamification on a personal initiative. Points, quests and storylines are the mechanics of gamification that the respondents most often applied in their work. Courses in which respondents the most frequently applied gamification were the mathematics, Croatian language and foreign languages. Also, the respondents in high percentage agreed with the effects and impacts of gamification on motivation and engagement of students, which represent the benefits of gamification. The lack of time and formal reasons were indicated as the reasons for non-usage of gamification, while motivation and engagement were set out as reasons for the usage of gamification.;"[Vukovac, Dijana Plantak; Hajdin, Goran] Univ Zagreb, Fac Org & Informat, Pavlinska 2, Varazhdin 42000, Croatia";Vukovac, DP (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb, Fac Org & Informat, Pavlinska 2, Varazhdin 42000, Croatia.;"dijana.plantak@foi.hr; majaskara1990@gmail.com; goran.hajdin@foi.hr";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;19;1;1;3;26;POLYTECHNIC RIJEKA;RIJEKA;VUKOVARSKA 58, RIJEKA, 00000, CROATIA;1848-1299;1849-1723;NA;ZB VELEUC RIJECI;Zb.

It is noticed that many students have difficulty to learn programming by several reasons: methodology, tools, programming languages, lack of programming logic in basic education, motivation, among others. Thus, this carries out a survey of the state of the art of existing and documented approaches in the literature, through a mapping of published works in the last five years (2012 to 2016) in two of Brazil's leading scientific computing platforms (CEIE and RENOTE), whose focus is to present solutions that address methodologies and tools that can be used in the different teaching modalities. As methodology was used the Systematic Review of Literature. As a result, it was found that, although studies still focus on higher education, in recent years there has been an increasing interest in programming teaching projects for children and teenagers, using gamification and tools such as Scratch. The results also demonstrate the growing interest of researchers in the search for approaches that provide better results in this area.;"[Borges, R.

Nevertheless, previous research is taking for granted that students have a positive attitude towards EVGs and did not ensure a proper understanding of students' characteristics that might influence their attitude towards them. Therefore, this study's main goal is to explore four students' characteristics (perceived relevance, perceived confidence, media affinity, and perceived self-efficacy) that influence students' attitude towards the use of EVGs to develop competencies. Using the fsQCA method to analyze data gathered on a sample of 128 undergraduate students we delve into different configurations underlying students' positive and negative attitude towards the use of EVGs. Main results suggest three configurations leading to a positive attitude with perceived, relevance being a necessary and sufficient condition for students' positive attitude towards the use of EVGs to develop their competencies. Four configurations were found to condition a negative attitude suggesting that equifinality can be considered when explaining students' attitude towards the use of EVGs to develop competencies. Implications for teachers, limitations of the study, and future research lines are addressed at the end of the paper. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Past research demonstrates that serious games are prime candidates to utilise these principles, however the potential benefits of this approach for delivering drug education are yet to be examined in Australia, a country where drug education in schools is mandatory. Design and MethodsThe serious game Pure Rush' was developed across three stages. First, formative consultation was conducted with 115 students (67% male, aged 15-17 years), followed by feasibility and acceptability testing of a prototype of the game (n = 25, 68% male). In the final stage, 281 students (62% female, aged 13-16 years) were randomly allocated to receive a lesson involving Pure Rush or an active control lesson. The lessons were compared in terms of learning outcomes, lesson engagement and future intentions to use illicit drugs. ResultsStudents enjoyed playing Pure Rush, found the game age-appropriate and the information useful to them. Both the Pure Rush and the active control were associated with significant knowledge increase from pre to post-test. Among females, multi-level mixed-effects regression showed knowledge gain was greater in the Pure Rush condition compared to control ( = 2.36, 95% confidence interval 0.36-4.38). There was no evidence of between condition differences in lesson engagement or future intentions to use illicit drugs. Discussion and ConclusionsPure Rush is an innovative online drug education game that is well received by students and feasible to implement in schools.

This has been problematic in a number of ways and resulted in fragmented literature and inconsistent referencing patterns between different sub-disciplines and countries. This is mainly because no distinct single-disciplinary perspective has emerged because of: the cross-disciplinary nature of educational games, a reliance on single-disciplinary contexts for studies, changing terminologies in different contexts and the use of multi-methodological approaches. Distinct perspectives from education science, game science, neuroscience and information science have deepened our understanding of play and games.

This study describes and evaluates the Engaging an Interdisciplinary Team for NSCLC (GAIN 3.0) experiential learning-based educational curriculum. METHODS: GAIN 3.0 was designed to enhance interdisciplinary collaboration for effective NSCLC diagnosis, assessment, and treatment. The program used a flipped classroom model that included an e-learning component prior to a live 6-hour interactive program. The interactive program included hands-on simulations, small group workshops, gamification, and case discussions. Participants included academic and community members of multidisciplinary lung cancer teams. Assessments included an online baseline survey, a pretest and posttest, a program evaluation, a long-term survey (LTS), and on-site faculty evaluation of participants. RESULTS: Of 416 attendees to 13 live GAIN 3.0 programs (nine in the United States and four in Europe), 304 (73%) completed the pretest and 187 (45%) completed the posttest. Out of a perfect score of 12 points, program participants had a mean test score of 6.3 +/- 2.1 on the pretest (52%) and 7.8 +/- 2.1 on the posttest (65%) (P = .03). There was an overall knowledge increase of 13% from pretest to posttest. Most LTS respondents (65%) rated the GAIN 3.0 live programs as high impact. On the LTS, the areas with the greatest gains in participants who had very high confidence were communication across disciplines, use of a team-based approach, and personalized treatment. CONCLUSIONS: GAIN 3.0 was a highly successful interdisciplinary activity that improved participants' knowledge, competence, and likely the clinical care provided to patients with NSCLC.;"[Murgu, Septimiu] Univ Chicago Med, Dept Med, Chicago, IL USA; [Rabito, Robb; Lasko, Greg; Jackson, Chad] Amer Coll Chest Phys, Glenview, IL USA; [Mino-Kenudson, Mari] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA USA; [Ettinger, David S.] Johns Hopkins, Sidney Kimmel Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD USA; [Ramalingam, Suresh S.] Emory Univ, Dept Med, Winship Canc Inst, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Edell, Eric S.] Mayo Clin, Dept Med, Rochester, MN 55902 USA";Edell, ES (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55902 USA.;edell.eric@mayo.edu;Ramalingam, Suresh/AAV-7478-2020;NA;"Merck (US Summits); Lilly USA, LLC (US Summits); Genentech/Astellas (US Summits); Bristol Myers Squibb (US Summits); Bristol Myers Squibb (EU Summits)";This work was supported by Merck (US Summits), Lilly USA, LLC (US Summits), Genentech/Astellas (US Summits), and Bristol Myers Squibb (US and EU Summits).;NA;50;5;5;0;18;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0012-3692;NA;NA;CHEST;Chest;APR;2018;153;4;NA;NA;NA;NA;876;887;NA;10.1016/j.chest.2017.11.032;NA;NA;12;"Critical Care Medicine; Respiratory System";"General & Internal Medicine; Respiratory System";GB6OF;WOS:000429188100026;29246769;NA;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

This paper presents a case study of a tablet-based application designed for primary school students in rural Sri Lanka for learning mathematics. In contrast to the previous studies done in developing countries, we carried out an in situ field study over 2 weeks with grade three students (8-year-olds) in two different under-resourced government schools. A comparison study was performed between students who learned through the traditional teaching methods and the ones who learned through the gamified tablet application. Using the post-colonial computing perspective, we report how some of the assumptions commonly applied in the developed countries do not work in a developing country such as Sri Lanka and how the introduction of gamified tablet applications afforded an environment that defied certain cultural norms making students feel comfortable around the teacher. We also observed the traditional teacher-centric learning transforming into a balanced mix of student-centric learning where students took ownership of their learning.;"[Halloluwa, Thilina; Vyas, Dhaval] QUT, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Usoof, Hakim; Hewagamage, K.

In the present study, we report on the results of the progress of a project for developing a setting for a gamified website carried out ad hoc, complemented by transmedia resources and aimed at scientific promotion and the promotion of technological and scientific careers (S&T) in adolescents, who are at a stage in life when career preferences are established. At present, the decrease in S&T careers is one of the greatest problems for the society of technological development that we live in, where the number of professionals working in key areas for economic development and progress is declining. After completing a pre-and post-project participation survey, the results suggest a high level of efficiency achieved by projects of this type due to their online experimentation design, the knowledge of real cases of research activity, and the communication of positive scientific values and attitudes appropriate for the target population. The participants significantly increased their interest in the subject area, scientific professions, and research activity and their social benefits demonstrating the acquisition of positive attitudes towards scientific knowledge and skills.;"[Perez-Manzano, Antonio] Univ Murcia, Dept Evolutionary Psychol & Educ, Murcia, Spain; [Almela-Baeza, Javier] Univ Murcia, Fac Commun & Documentat, Murcia, Spain";Perez-Manzano, A (corresponding author), Univ Murcia, Dept Evolutionary Psychol & Educ, Murcia, Spain.;"aperez@um.es; javier.almela@um.es";Almela-Baeza, J/AAB-6097-2019;"Almela-Baeza, J/0000-0003-0003-4967; Perez Manzano, Antonio/0000-0003-1480-3579";"Telefonica Foundation; Education Authority of the Region of Murcia (Seneca Foundation, the Regional Science and Technology Agency); Spanish Polar Committee; Spanish Army and Navy";A project encouraged and financed by Telefonica Foundation with the participation of the Education Authority of the Region of Murcia (through the Seneca Foundation, the Regional Science and Technology Agency) and in collaboration with the Spanish Polar Committee and the Spanish Army and Navy.;NA;31;23;24;4;48;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;NA;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;APR 1;2018;26;55;NA;NA;NA;NA;93;103;NA;10.3916/C55-2018-09;NA;NA;11;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";"Communication; Education & Educational Research";GB4HD;WOS:000429020300009;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Though games can be used to engage various learning styles and behaviors, the platform is mainly practiced at the secondary educational grade level with traditional-aged students. Little research literature exists that explores the influence of digital game-based learning on the academic achievement of nontraditional undergraduate students. An extensive literature review of 77 articles was conducted using the procedure developed in Cooper's Taxonomy (1998) for analyzing and synthesizing literature. Cooper's system involved (a) formulating the problem, (b) collecting data, (c) evaluating data appropriateness, (d) analyzing and interpreting relevant data, and (e) organizing and presenting the results.

With the growing push for creativity in the classroom as well as the application of effective technology in teaching and learning, it can be a daunting task for educators to find fitting competitive or game-based learning platforms. Foremost, educators need to consider elements such as motivation and whether the platform is likely to foster and reinforce learning. In the present study, a cohort of undergraduates at a public university in Malaysia were exposed to the use of Kahoot!, a game-based learning platform, during their weekly lectures for one semester. The participants were students of English for the Media, which covers theoretical and practical dimensions. The latter dimension includes the learning and application of media language features and devices. Survey data (51 respondents) on the whole, indicated that the students found Kahoot! to be beneficial in terms of: 1) inducing motivation as well as engagement, and 2) fostering and reinforcing learning (for both theoretical and practical aspects). The 33-item questionnaire created by the researchers was also tested for reliability, with returned values indicating high internal consistency, thus making the instrument a reliable option for use in future studies. The findings of this study are of relevance to researchers, educators, course designers, and designers of game-based learning applications.;"[Lin, Debbita Tan Ai; Ganapathy, M.; Kaur, Manjet] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Languages Literacies & Translat, English Language Studies Sect, Usm 11800, Penang, Malaysia";Ganapathy, M (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Languages Literacies & Translat, English Language Studies Sect, Usm 11800, Penang, Malaysia.;"debbita_tan@usm.my; malinik@usm.my; manjeet@usm.my";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;42;14;15;3;13;UNIV PUTRA MALAYSIA PRESS;SELANGOR;SERDANG, SELANGOR, 00000, MALAYSIA;0128-7702;2231-8534;NA;PERTANIKA J SOC SCI;Pertanika J.

In this study, we tested whether badges, which could be received for successful task performance and specific activities within an e-learning course in a higher education setting, had an impact on students' motivation and performance. In a between-subjects experimental field study, students were randomly assigned to three different conditions (no badges, badges visible to peers, badges only visible to students themselves). The results show that badges have less impact on motivation and performance than is commonly assumed. Independent of condition, students' intrinsic motivation decreased over time.

Several studies state that the main limitations of the MOOCs are low completion and high dropout rates of participants. However, MOOCs suffer also from the lack of participant engagement, personalization, and despite the fact that several formats and types of MOOCs are reported in the literature, the majority of them contain a considerable amount of content that is mainly presented in a video format. This is in contrast to the results reported in other educational settings, where engagement and active participation are identified as success factors. We present the results of a study that involved educational experts and learning scientists giving new and interesting insights towards the conceptualization of a new design approach, the flipped MOOC, applying the flipped classroom approach to the MOOCs' design and making use of gamification and learning analytics. We found important indications, applicable to the concept of a flipped MOOC, which entails turning MOOCs from mainly content-oriented delivery machines into personalized, interactive, and engaging learning environments. Our findings support the idea that MOOCs can be enriched by the orchestration of a flipped classroom approach in combination with the support of gamification and learning analytics.;"[Klemke, Roland; Antonaci, Alessandra] Open Univ Netherlands, Welten Inst, NL-6419 AT Heerlen, Netherlands; [Eradze, Maka] Tallinn Univ, Sch Digital Technol, Narva Rd 25, EE-10120 Tallinn, Estonia";Klemke, R (corresponding author), Open Univ Netherlands, Welten Inst, NL-6419 AT Heerlen, Netherlands.;"roland.klemke@ou.nl; maka@tlu.ee; alessandra.antonaci@ou.nl";Eradze, Maka/AAD-8394-2020;"Eradze, Maka/0000-0003-0723-1955; Klemke, Roland/0000-0002-9268-3229";"Open University of the Netherlands; Tallinn University";The research reported here has been funded on internal cost of the Open University of the Netherlands and Tallinn University.

To date, there is no consensus on how to effectively teach these skills in a forum that engages learners, immerses members in life-like activities, and builds both trust and rapport. Recreational 'Escape Rooms' have gained popularity in creating a life-like environment that rewards players for working together, solving puzzles, and completing successions of mind-bending tasks in order to effectively 'escape the room' in the time allotted. In this regard, escape rooms share many parallels with the multitasking and teamwork that is essential for a successful emergency department (ED) shift. A pilot group of nine emergency medicine (EM) residents and one senior EM faculty member underwent a commercial escape room as part of a team-building exercise in January 2018. The escape room required participants to practice teamwork, communication, task delegation, and critical thinking to tackle waves of increasingly complex puzzles, ranging from hidden objects, physical object assembly (i.e., jigsaw puzzles), and symbol matching. Activities required members to recognize and utilize the collective experiences, skills, knowledge base, and physical abilities of the group. After the game, players underwent a structured 'game-master' debriefing facilitated by an employee of the commercial escape room; this was followed by a post-event survey facilitated by a faculty member, which focused on participants' feelings, experiences, and problem-solving techniques. Escape rooms afford learners the opportunity to engage in an activity that rewards teamwork and effective leadership through experiences that directly link to specific ACGME milestones and educational learning theories. EM participants were engaged in the activity and felt that the escape room reproduced an environment analogous to the ED. The debriefing that followed the activity provided a satisfactory conclusion to the experience; but learners preferred a more organized debriefing format that provided them with constructive and specific feedback on their performance.";"[Zhang, Xiao Chi] Thomas Jefferson Univ Hosp, Emergency Dept, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Lee, Hyunjoo; Rodriguez, Carlos; Rudner, Joshua; Papanagnou, Dimitrios] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Chan, Teresa M.] McMaster Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Med, Div Emergency Med, Hamilton, ON, Canada";Zhang, XC (corresponding author), Thomas Jefferson Univ Hosp, Emergency Dept, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.;xzhang09@gmail.com;Chan, Teresa/T-6676-2017;Chan, Teresa/0000-0001-6104-462X;NA;NA;NA;9;26;26;3;14;CUREUS INC;PALO ALTO;PO BOX 61002, PALO ALTO, CA 94306 USA;NA;2168-8184;NA;CUREUS;Cureus;MAR;2018;10;3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;e2256;10.7759/cureus.2256;NA;NA;9;Medicine, General & Internal;General & Internal Medicine;HB3FX;WOS:000450937400008;29725559;Other Gold, Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Taking a child-first (as opposed to a law-first) approach, the study has sought to assess children's legal understanding using digital gaming as a research tool. We have identified as an area of particular strength children's attitudes to gender equality, and we have determined that many children demonstrate competency to deal with consumer-related issues appropriately. However, at the other extreme, we have established that children demonstrate considerable uncertainty concerning the levels of force that adult authority figures are permitted to exercise over them. We have found in the course of this study that children are competent and willing to express their views on matters that concern them. However, they do not expect to be invited to do this in their day-to-day lives. Related to this we have found a vast lack of awareness among children concerning the rights afforded to them under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.;"[Watkins, Dawn] Univ Leicester, Leicester Law Sch, Leicester, Leics, England; [Law, Effie Lai-Chong] Univ Leicester, Dept Informat, Leicester, Leics, England; [Barwick, Joanna] De Montfort Univ, Cyber Technol Inst, Leicester, Leics, England";Watkins, D (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Leicester Law Sch, Leicester, Leics, England.;dew3@le.ac.uk;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;69;4;4;0;3;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;CAMBRIDGE;EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND;0261-3875;1748-121X;NA;LEGAL STUD;Leg.

Conclusions: Combining learning with physical activity through gamification is a promising method for promoting active school transportation. The time and energy spent increasing active school transportation enrich learning activities and health and are therefore well invested.;"[Rutberg, Stina; Lindqvist, Anna-Karin] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Hlth Sci, Lulea, Sweden";Rutberg, S (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Hlth Sci, Lulea, Sweden.;stina.rutberg@ltu.se;NA;NA;"Municipality of Lulea; Department of Health Sciences at Lulea University of Technology";We are grateful to the children, teachers and parents who participated in the study.

In pursuit of energy efficiency and true sustainability, buildings must acquire the ability to interact as well as to generate synergies. The most prominent features of this approach are energy management and information flows which, intelligently designed, not only enhance buildings' capabilities, but also introduce a significant change in their relationship with the surrounds ('smart cities') and its inhabitants. This new paradigm calls for revisiting undergraduate architectural instruction, adopting a more complex overview of energy use and management in the design process, regarding buildings as dynamic rather than static entities. The methodology focuses on creating learning environments that favour students' participation in problem solving and assessment, encouraging teamwork based on case studies and stressing the connection between this new architecture, ICTs included, and social networks as participatory design tools. These ideas were implemented in a pilot learning experience conducted at the University of Seville for undergraduate students. The use of ICTs and the collaboration of non-academic experts were observed to further student promotion and projection beyond the academic environment and introduce them to the professional community.;"[Dominguez-Amarillo, Samuel] Univ Seville, Inst Univ Arquitectura & Ciencias Construcc, Escuela Tecn Super Arquitectura, Avda Reina Mercedes 2, E-41012 Seville, Spain; [Fernandez-Aguera, Jesica] CSIC, Inst Ciencias Construcc Eduardo Torroja, Serrrano Galvache 4, Madrid, Spain; [Fernandez-Aguera, Patricia] Univ Seville, Fac Psicol, C Camilo Jose Cela, Seville 41018, Spain";Dominguez-Amarillo, S (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Inst Univ Arquitectura & Ciencias Construcc, Escuela Tecn Super Arquitectura, Avda Reina Mercedes 2, E-41012 Seville, Spain.;sdomin@us.es;DOMINGUEZ-AMARILLO, SAMUEL/K-3377-2014;DOMINGUEZ-AMARILLO, SAMUEL/0000-0002-9177-8736;NA;NA;NA;14;5;5;2;18;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2631-6862;1938-7806;NA;ARCHNET-IJAR;Archnet-IJAR;MAR;2018;12;1;NA;NA;NA;NA;367;375;NA;10.26687/archnet-ijar.v12i1.1298;NA;NA;9;Architecture;Architecture;GC4HZ;WOS:000429746900022;NA;Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

We aimed to explore the effectiveness, acceptability and usefulness of mobile applications (apps) for cardiovascular disease self-management and risk factor control. Design Systematic review with meta-synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data. Methods Comprehensive search of multiple databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, SCOPUS and Cochrane CENTRAL) and grey literature. Studies were included if the intervention was primarily an app aimed at improving at least two lifestyle behaviours in adults with cardiovascular disease. Meta-synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data was performed to review and evaluate findings. Results Ten studies of varying designs including 607 patients from five countries were included. Interventions targeted hypertension, heart failure, stroke and cardiac rehabilitation populations. Factors that improved among app users were rehospitalisation rates, disease-specific knowledge, quality of life, psychosocial well-being, blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, cholesterol and exercise capacity. Improved physical activity, medication adherence and smoking cessation were also characteristic of app users. Appealing app features included tracking healthy behaviours, self-monitoring, disease education and personalised, customisable content. Small samples, short duration and selection bias were noted limitations across some studies, as was the relatively low overall scientific quality of evidence. Conclusions Multiple behaviours and cardiovascular disease risk factors appear modifiable in the shorter term with use of mobile apps. Evidence for effectiveness requires larger, controlled studies of longer duration, with emphasis on process evaluation data to better understand important system- and patient-level characteristics.;"[Coorey, Genevieve M.; Mulley, John; Redfern, Julie] George Inst Global Hlth Australia, POB M201,Missenden Rd, Sydney, NSW 2050, Australia; [Coorey, Genevieve M.; Redfern, Julie] Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Neubeck, Lis] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Hlth & Social Care, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Neubeck, Lis] Univ Sydney, Sydney Nursing Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia";Coorey, GM (corresponding author), George Inst Global Hlth Australia, POB M201,Missenden Rd, Sydney, NSW 2050, Australia.;gcoorey@georgeinstitute.org.au;"Neubeck, Lis/AAL-2192-2020; Coorey/AAM-1503-2021; Redfern, Julie/AAM-8617-2020";"Neubeck, Lis/0000-0001-5852-1034; Redfern, Julie/0000-0001-8707-5563";"National Heart Foundation Health Professional ScholarshipNational Heart Foundation of Australia [101544]; Career Development and Future Leader Fellowship - National Health and Medical Research CouncilNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia; National Heart FoundationNational Heart Foundation of Australia [APP1061793]";The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: GMC is supported by a National Heart Foundation Health Professional Scholarship (101544).

Although teachers offer the information foundation and relationship among knowledge points, there are still few methods to encourage students to explore the structure of knowledge by themselves outside of classes. This paper explores the gamification method and the knowledge structure of computer science. We assess the gamification method of splitting and combining (SC) to encourage students to finish the process of learning structured knowledge in the university. The results show that this method works well in promoting learning enjoyment and that splitting demonstrates better performance than combining. We can consider the SC method when recommending a gamification method to engage students in structural learning assistance in future smart university education.;"[Song, Donglei; Xu, Hao] Jilin Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Shi, Daqian] Univ Manchester, Adv Comp Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Wang, Rusi] Jilin Univ, Sch Math, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Xu, Hao] Jilin Univ, Sch Management, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Xu, Hao] Jilin Univ, Zhuhai Coll, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Zhuhai 519041, Peoples R China; [Xu, Hao] Jilin Univ, Minist Educ, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China";"Xu, H (corresponding author), Jilin Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China.; Xu, H (corresponding author), Jilin Univ, Sch Management, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China.; Xu, H (corresponding author), Jilin Univ, Zhuhai Coll, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Zhuhai 519041, Peoples R China.; Xu, H (corresponding author), Jilin Univ, Minist Educ, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China.";"dongleisong93@foxmail.com; daqian.shi@student.manchester.ac.uk; wangrusiu@163.com; xuhao@jlu.edu.cn";NA;Song, Donglei/0000-0001-6737-6932;"Development Project of Jilin Province of China [20170203002GX, 20160414009GH, 20170101006JC, 20160204022GX]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61472159, 71620107001, 71232011]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M601379]; MOE Research Center for Online Education Quantong Education Foundation [2017YB131]; Zhuhai Government; Premier Key-Discipline Enhancement Scheme";This work is supported by the Development Project of Jilin Province of China (No. 20170203002GX, 20160414009GH, 20170101006JC, 20160204022GX), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61472159, 71620107001, 71232011), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2016M601379) and MOE Research Center for Online Education Quantong Education Foundation (No. 2017YB131).

In order to understand the interactions among these correlated aspects and elicit potential threats geared towards a given organization, different security requirements analysis approaches are proposed in the literature. However, the body of knowledge is yet to unleash its full potential due to the complex nature of security problems, and inadequate ways to improve security awareness of key players in the organization. Objective: Objective(s) of the research study is to improve the security awareness of players utilizing serious games via: (i) Know-how of security concepts and security protection; (ii) guided process of identifying valuable assets and vulnerabilities in a given organizational setting; (iii) guided process of defining successful security attacks to the organization. Method: Important methods used to address the above objectives include: (i) a comprehensive review of the literature to better understand security and game design elements; (ii) designing a serious game using cyber security knowledge and game-based techniques combined with security requirements engineering concepts; (iii) using empirical evaluation (observation and survey) to verify the effectiveness of the proposed game design. Result: The solution proposed is a serious game for security requirements education, which: (i) can be an effective and fun way of learning security related concepts; (ii) mimics a real life problem setting in a presentable and understandable way; (iii) motivates players to learn more about security related concepts in future.

However, recent technologies have provided new opportunities for using games and their elements to enhance learning and student engagement. Objective: The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we discuss how game-related methods have been used in the context of software engineering education by means of a systematic mapping study. Second, we investigate how these game-related methods support specific knowledge areas from software engineering. By achieving these goals, we aim not only to characterize the state of the art on the use of game-related methods on software engineering education, but also to identify gaps and opportunities for further research. Method: We carried out a systematic mapping study to identify primary studies which address the use, proposal or evaluation of games and their elements on software engineering education. We classified primary studies based on type of approaches, learning goals based on software engineering knowledge areas, and specific characteristics of each type of approach. Results: We identified 156 primary studies, published between 1974 and June 2016. Most primary studies describe the use of serious games (86) and game development (57) for software engineering education, while Gamification is the least explored method (10). Learning goals of these studies and their development of skills are mostly related to the knowledge areas of Software Process, Software Design, and Professional Practices. Conclusions: The use of games in software engineering education is not new. However, there are some knowledge areas where the use of games can still be further explored. Gamification is a new trend and existing research in the field is quite preliminary. We also noted a lack of standardization both in the definition of learning goals and in the classification of game-related methods.;"[Souza, Mauricio R. de A.; Veado, Lucas; Figueiredo, Eduardo] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Comp Sci, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Moreira, Renata Teles; Costa, Heitor] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Comp Sci, Lavras, MG, Brazil";Souza, MRD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Comp Sci, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.;"mrasouza@dcc.ufmg.br; furtini@dcc.ufmg.br; renata@dcc.ufla.br; figueiredo@dcc.ufmg.br; heitor@dcc.ufla.br";NA;Souza, Mauricio/0000-0002-0182-8016;"Brazilian funding agency: CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [424340/2016-0, 142022/2017-9]; Brazilian funding agency: CAPESCAPES; Brazilian funding agency: FAPEMIGMinas Gerais State Research Foundation (FAPEMIG) [PPM-00651-17]";This research was partially supported by Brazilian funding agencies: CNPq (grant 424340/2016-0 and 142022/2017-9), CAPES, and FAPEMIG (grant PPM-00651-17).;NA;41;21;21;3;42;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0950-5849;1873-6025;NA;INFORM SOFTWARE TECH;Inf.

However, many of these applications fail to achieve the desired benefits of gamification, mainly because of a poor design. Objective: This paper explores the conceptualization, implementation and monitoring phases of meaningful gamification strategies and proposes a solution for strategy experts that hides the implementation details and helps them focus only on what is crucial for the success of the strategy. The solution makes use of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology. Method: An easy-to-use graphical editor is used to provide the high-level models that represent the design of the gamification strategy and its deployment and monitoring. These models contain the event pattern definitions to be automatically transformed into code. This code is then deployed both in a CEP engine to detect the conditions expressed in such patterns and in an enterprise service bus to execute the corresponding pattern actions. Results: The paper reports on the use of both a graphical modeling editor for gamification domain definition and a graphical modeling editor for gamification strategy design, monitoring and code generation in event-based systems. It also shows how the proposal can be used to design and automate the implementation and monitoring of a gamification strategy in an educational domain supported by a well-known Learning Management System (LMS) such as Moodle. Conclusion: It can be concluded that this unprecedented model-driven approach leveraging gamification and CEP technology provides strategy experts with the ability to graphically define gamification strategies, which can be directly transformed into code executable by event-based systems. Therefore, this is a novel solution for bringing CEP closer to any strategy expert, positively influencing the gamification strategy design, implementation and real-time monitoring processes.;"[Calderon, Alejandro; Boubeta-Puig, Juan; Ruiz, Mercedes] Univ Cadiz, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Sch Engn, Ave Univ Cadiz 10, Cadiz 11519, Spain";Calderon, A (corresponding author), Univ Cadiz, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Sch Engn, Ave Univ Cadiz 10, Cadiz 11519, Spain.;"alejandro.calderon@uca.es; juan.boubeta@uca.es; mercedes.ruiz@uca.es";"Boubeta-Puig, Juan/L-9429-2014; Ruiz, Mercedes/L-7317-2013; Calderon, Alejandro/F-9555-2016";"Boubeta-Puig, Juan/0000-0002-8989-7509; Ruiz, Mercedes/0000-0002-8527-4734; Calderon, Alejandro/0000-0002-0924-7478";"Spanish National Research Agency (AEI); ERDF funds under project amuSE [TIN2013-46928-C3-2-R]; ERDF funds under project BadgePeople [TIN2016-76956-C3-3-R]; ERDF funds under project DArDOS [TIN2015-65845-C3-3-R]";This work was funded by the Spanish National Research Agency (AEI) with ERDF funds under projects amuSE (TIN2013-46928-C3-2-R), BadgePeople (TIN2016-76956-C3-3-R) and DArDOS (TIN2015-65845-C3-3-R).;NA;41;6;6;0;18;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0950-5849;1873-6025;NA;INFORM SOFTWARE TECH;Inf.

Nevertheless, games are not considered mainstream material in medical teaching. Two research questions that arise are the following: What pedagogical strategies do developers use when creating games for medical education? And what is the quality of the evidence on the effectiveness of games? Methods: A systematic review was made by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers following the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines. We included peer-reviewed journal articles which described or assessed the use of serious games or gamified apps in medical education. We used the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) to assess the quality of evidence in the use of games. We also evaluated the pedagogical perspectives of such articles. Results: Even though game developers claim that games are useful pedagogical tools, the evidence on their effectiveness is moderate, as assessed by the MERSQI score. Behaviourism and cognitivism continue to be the predominant pedagogical strategies, and games are complementary devices that do not replace traditional medical teaching tools. Medical educators prefer simulations and quizzes focused on knowledge retention and skill development through repetition and do not demand the use of sophisticated games in their classrooms. Moreover, public access to medical games is limited. Discussion: Our aim was to put the pedagogical strategy into dialogue with the evidence on the effectiveness of the use of medical games. This makes sense since the practical use of games depends on the quality of the evidence about their effectiveness. Moreover, recognition of said pedagogical strategy would allow game developers to design more robust games which would greatly contribute to the learning process.;"[Gorbanev, Iouri] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Econ & Management Sch, Bogota, DC, Colombia; [Agudelo-Londono, Sandra; Yepes, Francisco J.] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Publ Hlth Inst, Bogota, Colombia; [Gonzalez, Rafael A.; Pomares, Alexandra] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Engn Sch, Bogota, Colombia; [Cortes, Ariel] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Econ & Management Sci Sch, Bogota, Colombia; [Delgadillo, Vivian; Munoz, Oscar] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Med Sch, Bogota, Colombia";Gorbanev, I (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Econ & Management Sch, Bogota, DC, Colombia.;yurigor@javeriana.edu.co;"Munoz, Oscar/Q-2906-2019; Gonzalez, Rafael/AAH-8888-2020; Yepes, Francisco J/AAH-7829-2019; Cortes, Ariel/R-4071-2019; Martinez, Ariel Emilio Cortes/AAQ-4305-2020; Harow, Cory/N-4221-2018";"Munoz, Oscar/0000-0001-5401-0018; Gonzalez, Rafael/0000-0003-1237-4408; Yepes, Francisco J/0000-0002-8060-4140; Martinez, Ariel Emilio Cortes/0000-0002-1169-9086; Harow, Cory/0000-0001-7234-5786";Pontificia Universidad Javeriana [IDPPTA 6891/IDPRY 7020];This research was possible thanks to financial support provided by Pontificia Universidad Javeriana to the Project 'APP CODIFICO - Aplicacion didactica movil para desarrollar capacidades de codificacion diagnostica en profesionales de medicina.

Various tools have been developed, e.g., mobile digital coaching systems connected with wearable sensors, serious games and patient web portals to personal health records, that aim to support patients with chronic conditions and their caregivers in realizing the ideal of self-management. We describe a platform that integrates these tools to support young patients in diabetes self-management through educational game playing, monitoring and motivational feedback. We describe the design of the platform referring to principles from healthcare, persuasive system design and serious game design. The virtual coach is a game guide that can also provide personalized feedback about the user's daily care related activities which have value for making progress in the game world. User evaluations with patients under pediatric supervision revealed that the use of mobile technology in combination with web-based elements is feasible but some assumptions made about how users would connect to the platform were not satisfied in reality, resulting in less than optimal user experiences. We discuss challenges with suggestions for further development of integrated pervasive coaching and gamification platforms in medical practice.;"[Klaassen, Randy; op den Akker, Rieks] Univ Twente, Fac Elect Engn Math & Comp Sci, Human Media Interact, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Bul, Kim C.

Whether a cognitive style of education combined with learning modules can impact learning outcomes and satisfaction in millennial medical students is unknown. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of cognitive styles and learning modules using mobile e-learning on knowledge gain, competence gain, and satisfaction for emergent ORL-HNS disorders. Methods: This randomized controlled trial included 60 undergraduate medical students who were novices in ORL-HNS at an academic teaching hospital. The cognitive style of the participants was assessed using the group embedded figures test. The students were randomly assigned (1: 1) to a novel interactive multimedia (IM) group and conventional Microsoft PowerPoint show (PPS) group matched by age, sex, and cognitive style. The content for the gamified IM module was derived from and corresponded to the textbook-based learning material of the PPS module (video lectures). The participants were unblinded and used fully automated courseware containing the IM or PPS module on a 7-inch tablet for 100 min. Knowledge and competence were assessed using multiple-choice questions and multimedia situation tests, respectively. Each participant also rated their global satisfaction. Results: All of the participants (median age 23 years, range 22-26 years; 36 males and 24 females) received the intended intervention after randomization. Overall, the participants had significant gains in knowledge (median 50%, interquartile range [IQR]= 17%-80%, P<.001) and competence (median 13%, IQR=0%-33%, P=.006). There were no significant differences in knowledge gain (40%, IQR=13%-76% vs 60%, IQR=20%-100%, P=.42) and competence gain (0%, IQR=-21% to 38% vs 25%, IQR=0%-33%, P=.16) between the IM and PPS groups. However, the IM group had a higher satisfaction score (8, IQR=6-9 vs 6, IQR=4-7, P=.01) compared with the PPS group. Using Friedman's two-way nonparametric analysis of variance, cognitive styles (field-independent, field-intermediate, or field-dependent classification) and learning modules (IM or PPS) had significant effects on both knowledge gain (both adjusted P<.001) and satisfaction (both adjusted P<.001). Conclusions: Mobile e-learning is an effective modality to improve knowledge of emergent ORL-HNS in millennial undergraduate medical students.

Because simulation can provide substantial quantitative participant feedback, leaderboards can be used, not only locally but also in a multidepartment, multicenter fashion. Quick Response (QR) codes can be integrated to allow participants to access and upload data. We present the development, implementation, and initial evaluation of an online leaderboard employing principles of gamification using points, badges, and leaderboards designed to enhance competition among healthcare providers. Method This article details the fundamentals behind the development and implementation of a user-friendly, online, multinational leaderboard that employs principles of gamification to enhance competition and integrates a QR code system to promote both self-reporting of performance data and data integrity. An open-ended survey was administered to capture perceptions of leaderboard implementation. Results Conceptual step-by-step instructions detailing how to apply the QR code system to any leaderboard using simulated or real performance metrics are outlined using an illustrative example of a leaderboard that employed simulated cardiopulmonary resuscitation performance scores to compare participants across 17 hospitals in 4 countries for 16 months. The following three major descriptive categories that captured perceptions of leaderboard implementation emerged from initial evaluation data from 10 sites: (1) competition, (2) longevity, and (3) perceived deficits. Conclusions A well-designed leaderboard should be user-friendly and encompass best practices in gamification principles while collecting and storing data for research analyses. Easy storage and export of data allow for longitudinal record keeping that can be leveraged both to track compliance and to enable social competition.;"[Chang, Todd P.] Childrens Hosp Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027 USA; [Chang, Todd P.] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Doughty, Cara B.; Lemke, Daniel; Khattab, Mona] Texas Childrens Hosp, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Doughty, Cara B.; Lemke, Daniel; Khattab, Mona] Baylor Coll Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Mitchell, Diana; Jani, Priti] Univ Chicago, Comer Childrens Hosp, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Rutledge, Chrystal; Tofil, Nancy] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL USA; [Rutledge, Chrystal; Tofil, Nancy] Childrens Hosp Alabama, Birmingham, AL USA; [Auerbach, Marc A.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT USA; [Auerbach, Marc A.] Yale New Haven Hlth Syst, New Haven, CT USA; [Frisell, Karin] Malarsjukhuset, Eskilstuna, Sweden; [Frisell, Karin; MacKinnon, Ralph J.] Karolinska Inst, Solna, Sweden; [Kessler, David O.] Childrens Hosp New York, New York, NY USA; [Kessler, David O.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Wolfe, Heather] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Wolfe, Heather] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [MacKinnon, Ralph J.] Royal Manchester Childrens Hosp, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Dewan, Maya] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp & Med Ctr, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Dewan, Maya] Univ Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Pirie, Jonathan; Nagamuthu, Chenthila; Walsh, Catharine M.] Hosp Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Pirie, Jonathan; Nagamuthu, Chenthila; Walsh, Catharine M.] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada";Chang, TP (corresponding author), Childrens Hosp Los Angeles, Div Emergency Med & Transport, 4650 Sunset Blvd,Mailstop 113, Los Angeles, CA 90027 USA.;Dr.toddchang@gmail.com;NA;NA;"American Heart AssociationAmerican Heart Association [15GRNT25030000]; National Health Services Grant";Supported by the American Heart Association Western States Grant-in-Aid Fund 15GRNT25030000 (TPC) and a National Health Services Grant (RJM).;NA;19;5;5;0;21;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;1559-2332;1559-713X;NA;SIMUL HEALTHC;Simul.

Methods: Two first-year classes of dental undergraduate students were recruited for the study which extended over 4 months and ended in January 2015. A pre-intervention assessment of students' academic writing skills was performed using criteria to evaluate writing. The same criteria were used to evaluate the final writing assignment after the intervention. Students' satisfaction with game aspects was assessed. The per cent change in writing score was regressed on scores of satisfaction with game aspects controlling for gender. Perceived improvement in writing was also assessed. Results: Data from 87 (94.6%) students were available for analysis. Students' overall satisfaction with the gamified experience was modest [mean (SD) = 5.9 (2.1)] and so was their overall perception of improvement in writing [mean (SD) = 6.0 (2.2)]. The per cent score of the first assignment was 35.6 which improved to 80 in the last assignment. Satisfaction with playing the game was significantly associated with higher percentage of improvement in actual writing skills [regression coefficient (95% confidence interval) = 21.1 (1.9, 40.2)]. Conclusion: Using gamification in an obligatory course for first-year dental students was associated with an improvement in academic writing skills although students' satisfaction with game aspects was modest and their willingness to use gamification in future courses was minimal.;"[El Tantawi, Maha; AlHumaid, Jehan] Univ Dammam, Coll Dent, Dept Prevent Dent Sci, Dammam, Saudi Arabia; [Sadaf, Shazia] Univ Dammam, Coll Dent, Dept Dent Educ, Dammam, Saudi Arabia";El Tantawi, M (corresponding author), Univ Dammam, Coll Dent, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.;maha_tantawy@hotmail.com;"Tantawi, Maha El/K-4336-2014; AlHumaid, Jehan/AAI-5416-2021; Sadaf, Shazia/A-4565-2015";"Tantawi, Maha El/0000-0003-4989-6584; AlHumaid, Jehan/0000-0002-8263-6285; Sadaf, Shazia/0000-0001-6044-9633";NA;NA;NA;29;11;12;1;22;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1396-5883;1600-0579;NA;EUR J DENT EDUC;Eur.

Poor mental health is consistently associated with deprivation, low income, unemployment, poor education, poorer physical health and increased health-risk behaviour. A plethora of research has examined the relationship between physical activity and mental wellbeing however, the influence of community-wide gamification-based physical activity interventions on mental wellbeing, to the authors' knowledge, is yet to be explored. In view of this paucity of attention, the current study examined the relationship between physical activity and mental wellbeing pre/post a community-wide, gamification-based intervention.

The concept of autonomy, the new role of students and teachers, learning through competencies or the development of metacognitive strategies will be the aspects to be exposed in the current paper because they are the ones which make Active Learning Methodologies relevant in today's context.;[Luelmo del Castillo, Ma Jose] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Mostoles, Spain;del Castillo, MJL (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Mostoles, Spain.;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;24;0;0;1;3;UNIV ALCALA HENARES, ESCUELA UNIV MAGISTERIO;CASTILLA LA MANCHA;MADRID, 1, GUADALAJARA, CASTILLA LA MANCHA, 19001, SPAIN;1989-0796;NA;NA;ENCUENTRO;Encuentro;NA;2018;NA;27;NA;NA;NA;NA;4;21;NA;NA;NA;NA;18;Linguistics;Linguistics;HZ1RL;WOS:000468625500001;NA;NA;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Also, it was planned to identify students' opinions regarding the applications. During the application process, for the experimental group, the Moodle LMS system with gamification in the classroom was used. For both groups, during an eight-week blended study period, the ARCS motivation model was used. The results of this study indicate that both groups successfully adapted to the ARCS model. Nevertheless, the experimental group, supported by gamification, reported better success than the control group. Another important finding is that students in both groups were highly motivated in the areas of self-confidence and satisfaction, but there was a significant difference in favour of the experimental group supported by gamification applications. It is hoped and believed that this study will provide a valuable contribution and background to the relevant literature.;[Ozdamli, Fezile] Near East Univ, Dept Comp Informat Syst, Mersin 10, Nicosia, Turkey;Ozdamli, F (corresponding author), Near East Univ, Dept Comp Informat Syst, Mersin 10, Nicosia, Turkey.;fezile.ozdamli@neu.edu.tr;Ozdamli, Fezile/AAH-1826-2020;NA;Research Fund of the Near East University [SOS-2016-2-001];This work was supported by Research Fund of the Near East University.

The advance of information and communications technology drives many researchers to explore the development of web-based instruction. Students encountering problems in the learning processes is not necessarily the lack of learning ability, but the inappropriate match between teachers' teaching methods and students' thinking and learning methods. Immutable instruction and assessment methods might benefit some students with certain thinking types and learning styles, but are unfavorable for others. This study intends to discuss the correlation between thinking styles and academic achievement in Web-Based Environmental Education. The quasi-experimental research with experimental design is adopted in this study, and two classes from Southwest University of Science and Technology is proceeded the experimental teaching. After retrieving the research data, the research results are summarized as below. 1. Environmental Education would affect learning achievement. 2. Environmental Education would influence learning retention. 3. Thinking styles present significantly positive effects on learning effect in academic achievement. 4.

Earthquake in the city was implemented in a school in Tehran, Iran, and its effectiveness on learning the concepts of professional commitment was evaluated. Earthquake in the city was built based upon a fantasy scenario occurring in an imaginary city. Each student took on a role in the city (citizen or healthcare provider). After finishing the game, participants were asked about the concept of professional commitment. Their definition was scored by a group of medical ethics experts separately in terms of compliance with the actual definitions and compared with their peers in the control group who did not participate in the game. A group of 16-year-old teenagers studying in the 11th grade participated in this intervention. The average score of conformity with the actual concept of professional commitment among the case group participants was significantly higher than the average value for the control group (P < 0.05). The results of this study could provide insights to planners and educators engaged in the education system so that gamification can be incorporated as an influential tool to teach the concepts of professional commitment.

Students were assessed with the Pattern of Adaptive Learning Scales' (PALS) Academic Efficacy subscale to control for prior academic self-efficacy. The same two instruments were used as posttests. An analysis of covariance showed no significant difference in students' Spanish achievement or in academic self-efficacy between students who used Duolingo (R) and students who were taught with traditional face-to-face instruction. This demonstrates that Duolingo (R) is a useful tool for teaching Spanish to elementary students.;"[Rachels, Jason R.] Calvary Christian Acad, Ft Lauderdale, FL USA; [Rockinson-Szapkiw, Amanda J.] Univ Memphis, Instruct Design & Technol, Memphis, TN 38152 USA";Rockinson-Szapkiw, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Memphis, Instruct Design & Technol, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.;"jasonr@ccaeagles.org; rcknsnsz@memphis.edu";Rockinson-Szapkiw, Amanda/AAO-8779-2020;"Rockinson-Szapkiw, Amanda/0000-0002-0682-1171; Rachels, Jason/0000-0003-4744-8227";NA;NA;NA;44;28;28;26;149;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0958-8221;1744-3210;NA;COMPUT ASSIST LANG L;Comput.

Yet, it is still a controversial issue in education and has received several criticisms. The existing literature suggests that when gamification is designed well and utilized correctly, it has potential to improve learning, but qualitative investigations are required in order to reveal how a wide range of game elements fit into different learning contexts. In order to address this gap, this qualitative study aims to explore students' overall perceptions about various game elements in a gamified instructional technology and material development course within a teacher education context. Based on the data gathered via interviews, observation, and documents (n = 118) for one academic year, the study examines possible impacts of game elements and how they should be designed and implemented from the students' perspectives. The results yielded nine main themes: challenge, narrative, leaderboard, reward, badge, teams, win-state, points, and constraints. This paper presents the gamification process, iterations made into the game elements, and main features of the game elements in a gamified teacher education course. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This increase in the popularity of digital games is mostly associated not only with the interesting designs of the digital games but also with the emotional satisfaction with these games. In recent years, this tendency towards digital games has led to the transfer of certain features of games to non-game contexts. The concept named gamification refers to the adaptation of game features to non-game contexts. Gamification has been in use in many areas in recent years. One of these areas is the field of education. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the effectiveness of elements of gamification in blended learning environments within the context of emotion, interest and online participation. In the study, the convergent parallel mixed design, which allowed explaining the quantitative and qualitative data in association with each other, was used. In this respect, the study was carried out with 63 university students (30 students in the experimental group and 33 students in the control group) in a period of 13 weeks. In the research process, the two groups of students were provided with the opportunity to experience the blended learning environment both on face-to-face basis and on online basis. The experimental group differed from the control group in terms of such gamification elements presented in face-to-face and online environments as being given directives, progress bar, badge, level, experience point, leader-board, award, completion rate, activity completion, activity restriction and activity feedback. According to the data collected in the study, gamification elements used in blended learning environments have caused the participants to develop both positive and negative emotions. In addition, it was revealed that gamification was found interesting by the participants Moreover, it was seen that there was a significant difference between the times spent by the groups in terms of their participation in online environment in favor of the experimental group. In addition, it was found that award, competition, level, badge and restriction were influential on the students' participation in online environment.;"[Mese, Can] Bozok Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Primary Educ, Yozgat, Turkey; [Dursun, Ozcan Ozgur] Anadolu Univ, Fac Educ Comp Educ & Instruct Technol, Eskisehir, Turkey";Mese, C (corresponding author), Bozok Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Primary Educ, Yozgat, Turkey.;"canmese@gmail.com; oodursun@anadolu.edu.tr";MESE, Can/AAA-2760-2020;MESE, Can/0000-0002-9759-7055;Anadolu University Scientific Research Projects CommissionAnadolu University [1507E555];This study is a part of the first author's Ph.D. dissertation, which is supervised by the second author.

The aims of the current study are to determine whether the students who played the game perceived any benefit to their pharmacology learning and to gauge any learning gain as a result of playing the game. Here, we present questionnaire data and thematic analysis collected from students who played Braincept along with our data on learning gain associated with play.

This study intends to contribute to filling this research gap. Silva's four dimensions of play - built from Henriot's theory of play - are used as an analytical framework to study a teaching situation where a gamified application, developed for this research project, was introduced in a French-as-a-foreign-language class in a Norwegian upper secondary school. This article focuses on the students' engagement in their learning activities and their control over the tasks. The interaction analysis of video data reveals that students are indeed showing expressions of playfulness and autonomy.

The dimensions - and the user types that they refer to - are Free spirit, Socializer, Achiever, Philanthropist, Player,and Disruptor.It is the motive of this study that identifying and studying these user types may prove useful for understanding the effects of gamification dynamics and mechanics and assist in designing specific gamification techniques corresponding to each user type. The adaptation of the instrument began with translation, continued with an examination of the linguistic equivalence, and finalized with analyses of validity and reliability. The scale items were initially translated by the researchers. The translation was examined by seven experts with good English proficiency to finalize the Turkish version. To verify the linguistic equivalence, both the Turkish and English versions were then administered to 30 English Language Education (ELE) students. The correlation findings showed a high degree of correlation between the Turkish and English versions. Next, the Turkish version was administered to 452 university students studying at the Faculty of Education, Sakarya University, to check its validity and reliability. The results obtained from a confirmatory factor analysis and the reliability analysis indicate that the Turkish version of the scale is valid and reliable.

The phenomenon of gamification is ambiguous and complex, and the fact that more and more spheres of human activity get signs of the game is of great concern. Though game and play activity is typical to humans, it has always created numerous risks and destructive situations. So, we argue that the ambiguity of the perception of the phenomenon of gamification is caused by the difficulties of understanding it, modern historical conditions and social practices that strongly influence and distort ideas about gamification. The aim of the article is to study the role of gamification on a specific example of using computer games for teaching philosophy in technical institutions of higher education. Game practices activate and educate emotional intelligence. It is especially necessary for students of technical institutions of higher education. The purpose of the analysis is to define both the positive and negative consequences of using games and to suggest a way to overcome possible destructive results. In the course of the research of this problem, the author concentrated on objective, historical and social analysis. Practical approach to methods of terminological analysis, ways of defining and choosing games, are particularly stressed. Looking for methods to overcame negative consequences of gamification, when using games in teaching, we stress the importance of philosophical approach. Because namely systemic, interdisciplinary analysis takes into account many factors of risk and influence of gamification. We suggest that in-deep analysis of compatibility and value of game technologies in teaching philosophy may be useful for overcoming possible negative consequences of gamification in education and training. We also consider that first priority should be given to comprehensive research and definition of methods for assessing the relevance, effectiveness, and even economic feasibility of using game technology for teaching and learning academic subject, as well as for specific topics.;[Rybka, Nataliia M.] Odessa Natl Polytech Univ, Dept Philosophy & Methodol Sci, Odessa, Ukraine;Rybka, NM (corresponding author), Odessa Natl Polytech Univ, Dept Philosophy & Methodol Sci, Odessa, Ukraine.;nmrybka@gmail.com;Nataliia, Rybka Mykolayivna/W-8706-2018;NA;NA;NA;NA;26;2;2;2;7;NATL ACAD PEDAGOGICAL SCIENCES UKRAINE, INST INFO TECHNOL & LEARNING TOOLS;KYIV;VUL M BERLYNSKOHO 9, KYIV, 04060, UKRAINE;2076-8184;NA;NA;INF TECHNOL LEARN TO;Inf.

Introductory teachings on how parallel and concurrent processes compete over shared resources have the underlying working principles of the operating system and computer architecture as a starting point for learning the mutual exclusion concepts. Conventional teaching method focuses on lectures and solving race condition problem with counting semaphore in C programming language. Before applying conventional teaching method, we advocate the introduction of a social game scenario in teaching basic concepts of workers concurrently competing over a shared resource. We also introduce a simplified mutual exclusion assignment in which the implementation complexity is reduced by application of a specially designed graphical mechanism for mutual exclusion. Compared to a conventional method, the proposed experimental teaching method has a 15% higher success rate in solving race condition problem in C programming language. Regardless of additional steps introduced to make students familiar with the concepts of mutual exclusion, the experimental method is slightly advantageous when median time-on-task results are compared.;"[Popovic, Miroslav; Vladimir, Klenno; Silic, Marin] Univ Zagreb, Fac Elect Engn & Comp, Dept ZEMRIS, Unska 3, Zagreb 10000, Croatia";Popovic, M (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb, Fac Elect Engn & Comp, Dept ZEMRIS, Unska 3, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.;popovic.miroslav@gmail.com;NA;NA;Croatian Science Foundation (Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost) through the Recommender System for Service-oriented Architecture research project [IP-2014-09-9606];The authors acknowledge the support of the Croatian Science Foundation (Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost) through the Recommender System for Service-oriented Architecture research project [grant number IP-2014-09-9606].;NA;32;0;0;0;3;KOREMA;ZAGREB;UNSKA 3, P P 473, ZAGREB, 10001, CROATIA;0005-1144;1848-3380;NA;AUTOMATIKA;Automatika;NA;2018;59;2;NA;NA;NA;NA;208;219;NA;10.1080/00051144.2018.1522462;NA;NA;12;"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering";GW6BG;WOS:000447028800007;NA;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

In this context, education/learning standards have sought to keep pace with a new student profile geared towards the digital environment by introducing new ways of learning that represent a compelling and innovative alternative for the development of student competencies. The study aims to analyse the relationship between innovation in education, engagement for learning and learning, as well as the moderating effect of the gamified method, within the scope of higher education institutions. It is a quantitative research, operationalised through a survey, applied to students of management courses in higher education institutions located in the South of Brazil. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the data. The results of the research showed the moderating effect of gamification in the learning process, indicating that students present a higher level of learning when exposed to the teaching method that uses the gamified method.

This study was an extension of our previous studies, which only considered the data from gamification systems, leaving several open questions about students' perspective. Two types of websites, Gamification (GM) and Non-gamification (NG) were used. While the GM website included game elements such as a Badge System, Score, Avatar, Leaderboard, Level, and Feedback (Notification), the NG website was a traditional website without game elements. In these websites, students conducted two main activities: creating their own questions (MCQs) and answering questions authored by classmates. Students were asked to complete the questionnaire regarding active learning, game elements, and motivation. Several statistical analyses were conducted to test four hypotheses, and results indicated support for all hypotheses. The results suggest that the application of gamification in engineering lab activities as a supporting tool has a positive effect on students' motivation, engagement, and learning outcome based on the consistency between students' performance in and subjective satisfaction with the gamification system. In addition, the results of frequency analysis indicate that 80% of students were motivated by Ranking and Score and 50% of students felt fun due to Badges, Feedback, and Avatar. Students chose Ranking and Score as the game elements to be retained in the new gamification system.;"[Kim, Eunsik; Rothrock, Ling; Freivalds, Andris] Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, 240 Leonhard Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA";Kim, E (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, 240 Leonhard Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.;"euk174@psu.edu; lxr28@psu.edu; axf@psu.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;51;10;10;2;10;TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS;DURRUS, BANTRY;IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND;0949-149X;NA;NA;INT J ENG EDUC;Int.

A statistical and comparative analysis was performed on the results obtained for each group. Findings It was concluded that the use of technological tools has a positive impact in terms of educational performance and learning, giving better results than traditional education; in addition, students showed great empathy with the AR tool. On the other hand, there were limitations to just having a Leap Motion Controller device, which prevented the student experience was even more didactic; based on this, for future research, factors such as the size of the population and the amount of available resources will be taken into account to achieve better results.

E-learning system involves digital content development, administration, and delivery of learning contents that can be made available even to remote locations. In the advent of huge digital content available on the internet, an effective e-learning system requires collaboration among the content creators, users, and administrators, further, it requires huge computational power and storage capacity. Presently, the system focuses mostly on the delivery of content to learners rather than concentrating on the effective storage and efficient retrieval of the content based on the skill of the individual learners. Several approaches have been attempted towards the personalised content delivery based on the basic skill of learners. However, the system maintained a repository of verified contents relatively than a validated content. In order to maintain a validated content for efficient retrieval, distributed models with respect to a different perspective of validation may be fruitful.

This study was conducted in an introductory computer course. The flipped classroom method is compared to traditional techniques in this study. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and a course interest survey in this 10-week mixed method study. Inferential and descriptive analysis methods were applied to the data. An independent samples t-test was used to determine the difference between experimental and control groups in terms of motivation. The interviews were analyzed with descriptive analysis method. Results showed that students who were trained with the flipped classroom method had more motivation than students who were trained with traditional methods. Students reported that hands-on in-class activities, group work, and gamification activities increased their motivation. Additionally, students reported that the difficulty level of in-class activities, watching videos, and dealing with the course outside of the classroom decreased their motivation. Consequently, when designed effectively, the flipped classroom method can increase the students' motivation towards the course.

Education can benefit from gamification by improving the learning environment to make it more enjoyable and engaging for students. Factors that influence students' preference for use of gamification are identified. Students are surveyed on their experiences of playing a gamified quiz, named Quick Quiz, during class. Quick Quiz features several gamification elements such as points, progress bars, leader boards, timers, and charts. Data collected from the survey is analysed using Partial Least Squares. Factors including 'usefulness', 'preference for use', 'knowledge improvement', 'engagement', 'immersion' and 'enjoyment' were found to be significant determinants. Students were found to have a preference for use for gamification in their learning environment.;"[Filippou, Justin; Cheong, Christopher; Cheong, France] RMIT Univ, Sch Business IT & Logist, Melbourne, Vic, Australia";Filippou, J (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Business IT & Logist, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.;justin.filippou@rmit.edu.au;NA;NA;RMIT University Business College Human Ethics Advisory Network (BCHEAN) [1000389];This research project was approved by the RMIT University Business College Human Ethics Advisory Network (BCHEAN project number 1000389).;NA;47;5;5;0;4;UNIV CANBERRA, FAC INFORMATION SCIENCES & ENGINEERING;BRUCE;BLDG 11, KIRINARI ST, BRUCE, ACT 2617, AUSTRALIA;1449-8618;1326-2238;NA;AUSTRALAS J INF SYST;Australas.

This article intends to present the concept of Gamification as a multimodal alternative for education, considering it a relatively recent initiative. It is a phenomenon still in its infancy, lacking in more studies and discussions, but not less interesting, since it proposes a new approach to education and many other segments of contemporary human knowledge. Method. The research shows that in Higher Education, as in other areas, its use is still incipient, because the controversy surrounding the theme is still considerable, however, it joins efforts with other proposals of the same magnitude, in an attempt to sublimate some of the learning problems of the individuals, leading them to the engagement and motivation in the educational environment. It is not a revolution, or a proposal to abandon pre-existing concepts and procedures, but an attempt to compose with what already exists and to take advantage of the benefits of evolution through which humanity passes, so that learning becomes increasingly more natural in the eyes of individuals. Results. Challenges will have to be transposed, and may be of a technological, financial, procedural, educational or structural nature. With more studies, research, and evaluation of the results, it is possible to evaluate if the initiative is consistent and if it has come to stay.;"[Cotta Orlandi, Tomas Roberto; Duque, Claudio Gottschalg; Mori, Alexandre Mori] Univ Brasilia UNB, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [de Andrade Lima Orlandi, Maria Tereza] Univ Catolica Brasilia UCB, Brasilia, DF, Brazil";Orlandi, TRC (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia UNB, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.;"tomasroberto@gmail.com; klaussherzog@gmail.com; xmorihome@gmail.com; mte.orlandi@gmail.com";"Duque, Claudio Gottschalg/AAG-5409-2021; Mori, A./F-9094-2012";"Mori, A./0000-0002-9922-5888; Gottschalg Duque, Claudio/0000-0003-3558-466X";NA;NA;NA;38;0;0;0;2;UNIV PITTSBURGH, UNIV LIBRARY SYSTEM;PITTSBURGH;3960 FORBES AVE, PITTSBURGH, PA 15260 USA;1562-4730;NA;NA;BIBLIOS;Biblios;NA;2018;NA;70;NA;NA;NA;NA;17;30;NA;10.5195/biblios.2018.447;NA;NA;14;Information Science & Library Science;Information Science & Library Science;GL3BQ;WOS:000437002600002;NA;DOAJ Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

Once play is positioned as a state of mind, activities that constitute work need not be disjunct from playful behavior. Yet for most workers, work is rarely if ever playful, and attempts to import play behavior into the workplace (gamification') do not result in greater playfulness. Part of this problem results from specific aesthetic values for games having dominated both work and play. As Roger Caillois warned half a century ago, sport-like values have increasingly saturated the culture of the overdeveloped world. Meanwhile, gamification processes have only been able to export task-focussed reward structures from the domain of play - practices that descend from Dungeons & Dragons, but that have been denuded of their playful qualities. In parallel to the gamification of work has been the gamification of games, namely an increasing emphasis on tasks to structure video game play (e.g., achievements), and thus make them more compelling yet less playful. In so much as this entails forcing particular patterns of understanding onto both players and workers, this makes gamification a parallel to Jacques Ranciere's stultification in education: a binding of wills instead of an emancipation. If we want a world where work could be more playful, we must begin by breaking the cultural dominance of sport-like and task-like aesthetics of play, and endeavour to overcome the underlying fears that prevent work from being played.;[Bateman, Chris] Univ Bolton, Sch Creat Technol, Manchester, Lancs, England;Bateman, C (corresponding author), Univ Bolton, Sch Creat Technol, Manchester, Lancs, England.;c.bateman@bolton.ac.uk;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;37;5;5;5;29;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1369-118X;1468-4462;NA;INFORM COMMUN SOC;Info.

New perspectives and innovations are required as physician leaders and medical educators strive to accelerate changes in medical education and practice to meet the needs of evolving populations and systems. The purpose of this paper is to introduce gaming science as a lens to magnify HSS integration opportunities in the scope of medical education and practice. Evidence supports gaming science innovations as effective teaching and learning tools to promote learner engagement in scientific and systems thinking for decision making in complex scenarios. Valuable insights and lessons gained through the history of war games have resulted in strategic thinking to minimize risk and save lives. In health care, where decisions can affect patient and population outcomes, gaming science innovations have the potential to provide safe learning environments to practice crucial decision-making skills. Research of gaming science limitations, gaps, and strategies to maximize innovations to further advance HSS in medical education and practice is required. Gaming science holds promise to equip health care teams with HSS knowledge and skills required for transformative practice.

The purpose of this paper is to examine how a participatory approach can deepen the understanding of how schoolchildren relate to and use gamification as a tool to promote physical activity and learning. Design/methodology/approach Inspired by the concept and process of empowerment and child participation, the methodological focus of this study was on consulting schoolchildren. During a two-month period, 18 schoolchildren (10-12 years old) participated in workshops to create game ideas that would motivate them to be physically active and learn in school. Findings The phenomenological analysis resulted in one main theme, Playing games for fun to be the best I can be. This consisted of four themes with two sub-themes each. The findings offer insights on how to increase physical activity and health education opportunities using serious games in school.

To describe and evaluate the impact of a competition on investment financial acumen, and its relationship with improved health care industry knowledge. Methods. Students' confidence on 19 specific areas was assessed by a survey before and after participation in the health care investment competition. Their performance was also compared to that of Standard & Poor's 500 Index for Healthcare. Results. Students' self-perception on their knowledge of all 19 domains significantly increased after they participated in the health care investment competition. The average score to questions increased from 1.9 to 3.8. Thirty-eight percent of the students who participated in the competition outperformed Standard & Poor's 500 Index for Healthcare in the duration of the competition. Conclusion. Students at the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy designed and implemented a novel way to teach students and faculty members about the business side of health care. The competition took the form of a competitive mock stock market style game and resulted in a marked increase in confidence in all observed areas. This increased confidence relates to the students' increased knowledge in how the health care industry works from a business perspective.;"[Wolf, Collin; Bott, Samuel; Hernandez, Inmaculada; Grieve, Lorin] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Pharm, Pittsburgh, PA USA";Grieve, L (corresponding author), 652 Salk Hall,3501 Terrace St, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.;loringrieve@pitt.edu;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2;1;1;0;12;AMER ASSOC COLL PHARMACY;ALEXANDRIA;1426 PRINCE STREET, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2815 USA;0002-9459;1553-6467;NA;AM J PHARM EDUC;Am.

In this study, four art education researchers explore geolocative co-figurative possibilities of mobile learning. The authors theorize co-figurative agency and heighten awareness of the importance of sociospatial relationships afforded by the current milieu of networked geolocative knowledge to arts pedagogy. Through analysis of case studies of art practice, a new theoretical concept called posthumanist movement art pedagogy is developed to investigate movement as a posthumanist art practice, enacting agency through mobile data co-figuration within spaces of geolocative awareness. Case studies concentrate on mobile new media art utilizing photography, gamification, Global Positioning System drawing, and data collection/broadcasting. Impacts on the field of art and education focus on movement as being co-figured with the body and geolocation data as sites for potential transformation, embodiment, play, and data-identity constructions.;"[Keifer-Boyd, Karen; Knochel, Aaron D.] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Patton, Ryan M.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA USA; [Sweeny, Robert W.] Indiana Univ Penn, Indiana, PA USA";Keifer-Boyd, K (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.;kk-b@psu.edu;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;87;2;2;0;2;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0039-3541;2325-8039;NA;STUD ART EDUC;Stud.

A review of the formation of this direction in sociology is offered, basic principles are designated. The empirical part of the work is devoted to the study of kindergarten as a special life world for children. Special attention is paid to the description of the data collection method interview-game, which I consider an adequate method for studying the children opinions. The methodical aspects of the interview-game usage are described. Analysis shows that children turn out to be unique experts of the world of childhood who, through a specially constructed conversation, can tell about their activity in the kindergarten and about their ideas for changing educational practices. Children emphasize importance of free playing with peers during the day, the specificity of care practices (eating and sleeping), the interaction tactics between the teacher and children, make their suggestions for creating more comfortable conditions in the kindergarten. Children turn out to be very creative innovators of practices to reconstruct the space of a kindergarten and to change the teacher's role and rules of communication. Our research shows that the grains of these ideas must be seriously and systematically collected to fully comprehend what the child wants to say. Methodically, the interview of children is one more step in the development of the method as data collection.;[Savinskaya, O.

Evidently, the rapid and continuous appearance of technological resources that are being integrated into the educational context in all corners of the world implies a constant effort in its adaptation to ensure that the teaching-learning process is effective and adequate to the new contexts. Blended learning has been Consolidated as an educational modality that is revolutionizing distance education and has been enriched with new technological resources and innovative methodological proposals, overcoming obstacles and making progress in new possibilities that guarantee the quality of blended education. In this sense, the contributions of international experts on blended learning are presented in this work. These contributions, which are based on in-depth knowledge and analysis of the scientific literature and the research focused on this teaching modality, offer experiences and practices enriched with technologies and emerging methodologies such as augmented reality, electronic rubrics, gamification and the flipped classroom, among others.

It shares features with blended learning, such as an increase in motivation and the optimization of results with respect to an activity that stimulates learning. In this sense, this paper outlines an analysis of publications in international databases in which the subject of gamification is addressed within the blended learning environment. This scientific literature review has been prepared using documentation as a method of systematization. This research analyzes 34 contributions between 2012 and 2017* indexed in the WOS and Scopus databases, using a search strategy with four criteria: recipients, topic, methodological design and main conclusions. Results demonstrate that the documented publications are focused on higher education students, especially in the area of engineering, display prototypes and models and feature methodological designs, in which the conceptual-theoretical framework predominates, followed by empirical and quantitative research. Amongst other outcomes, this paper concludes that there is a need to continue boosting the convergence between gamification and blended learning, due to its positive effects related to motivation, feedback and the acquisition of competencies by students.;"[Torres-Toukoumidis, Angel] Univ Politecn Salesiana, Sede Cuenca, Calle Turuhuayco 3-69 & Calle Vieja, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Romero Rodriguez, Luis Miguel] Univ Int la Rioja, UNIR, Huelva, Spain; [Perez Rodriguez, Amor] Univ Huelva, UHU, Huelva, Spain; [Romero Rodriguez, Luis Miguel] Univ Int La Rioja, Calle Mackay Macdonald 4,Piso 4,Puerta 4-D, Huelva 21004, Spain; [Perez Rodriguez, Amor] Fac Humanidades, Campus El Carmen,Avda Fuerzas Armadas S-N, Huelva 21007, Spain";Torres-Toukoumidis, A (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Salesiana, Sede Cuenca, Calle Turuhuayco 3-69 & Calle Vieja, Cuenca, Ecuador.;"atorrest@ups.edu.ec; luismiguel.romero@unir.net; amor@uhu.es";"Romero-Rodriguez, Luis M./P-8698-2014; Perez-Rodriguez, M.

This paper presents the SOCIALENERGY S/W platform, which is funded by the EU H2020 work programme SOCIALENERGY is a user engagement, social networking, gamification, and business management platform aiming at evolving energy markets' operation and educating virtual energy communities. The proposed business model is targeted on electric utilities' customer segment. The proposed system is modular by design incorporating several subsystems from various disciplines, such as ICT, energy efficiency, behavioral economics, education, and gamification. The proposed system facilitates the easy, rich, and deep communication among individual energy consumers, virtual energy communities, utilities, and other less direct stakeholders (such as electric appliance retailers and building renovators).

With that in mind, we created a staff development session that involved a playful learning activity, in which attendees experienced 90's nostalgia, whilst working on an important learning and teaching issue. Based on the British game show, The Crystal Maze, The 'Crys-TEL' maze required attendees to complete a number of challenges as a group to attempt to 'solve' a pressing learning and teaching issue. Using gamification techniques, defined as game design elements in non-game settings, attendees experienced different delivery styles, whilst always working towards the learning and teaching issue they had been asked to consider. In a nod to the original Crystal Maze game show, attendees worked in groups to score points for completing various tasks. The two groups with the most points competed against each other in the final to collect crystals, and ultimately conquer the 'maze'.

We tested the effectiveness of a novel mHealth intervention (mCME V.2.0) promoting CME among Vietnamese HIV clinicians. Methods We enrolled HIV clinicians from three provinces near Hanoi. The 6-month intervention consisted of (1) daily short message service multiple-choice quiz questions, (2) daily linked readings, (3) links to online CME courses and (4) feedback messages describing the performance of the participant relative to the group. Control participants had equal access to the online CME courses. Our primary endpoint was utilisation of the online CME courses; secondary endpoints were self-study behaviour, performance on a standardised medical exam and job satisfaction. Results From 121 total HIV clinicians in the three provinces, 106 (87.6%) enrolled, and 48/53 intervention (90%) and 47/53 control (89%) participants completed the endline evaluations. Compared with controls, intervention participants were more likely to use the CME courses (risk ratio (RR) 2.3, 95% CI 1.4 to 3.8, accounting for 83% of course use (P<0.001)). Intervention participants increased self-study behaviours over controls in terms of use of medical textbooks (P<0.01), consulting with colleagues (P<0.01), searching on the internet (P<0.001), using specialist websites (P=0.02), consulting the Vietnam HIV/AIDS treatment guidelines (P=0.02) and searching the scientific literature (P=0.09). Intervention participants outperformed controls on the exam (+23% vs +12% score gains, P=0.05) and had higher job satisfaction.

Prior to a statistical analysis of the results obtained over a tournament organized in one of Polish high schools, all its specifics are discussed at length, including the types of questions assigned, as well as additional self- and peer-evaluation questionnaires, constituting an integral part of the tournament. The impact of the tournament upon student improvement is examined by confronting the results of a post-test with pre-tournament students' achievements reflected in scores earned in former, tests written by the students in experimental group and their colleagues from control group. We also present some of students' and teachers' feedback on the idea of a tournament as a tool of assessment.

The game is intended for incorporation into any chemistry course for majors and non-majors that teaches sustainability and/or the Principles of Green Chemistry at the undergraduate level. The game is free of charge and encourages students to think like professional chemical designers and to develop a chemical product with respect to function and improved human and environmental health. This computer simulation has been assessed by educators and can be seamlessly integrated into an existing curriculum.

What remains to be seen is how badging will interact with traditional curricular elements. While concerns have been raised about using badges as extrinsic motivators in coursework, there are alternate areas of application for digital badging. Badges may actually serve to motivate and empower student learning and engagement outside of the formal curriculum. This action research was conducted to guide the implementation of a badging system at Maranatha Baptist University. It explores the concept of using digital badges as a platform for recognizing learning experiences in co-curricular education. More specifically, it seeks to determine how to best optimize a co-curricular digital badging system for maximum student engagement through a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic motivators. Student focus groups were used with a mixed-methods methodology of collecting data on potential student interest and involvement in a digital badging environment. The quantitative portion compares intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivations for participating, while the qualitative section consists of a coded analysis of student discussion of co-curricular digital badging.;[Coleman, Jonathan D.] Maranatha Baptist Univ, Off Inst Res & Effectiveness, 745 West Main St, Watertown, WI 53094 USA;Coleman, JD (corresponding author), Maranatha Baptist Univ, Off Inst Res & Effectiveness, 745 West Main St, Watertown, WI 53094 USA.;jonathan.coleman@mbu.edu;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;25;9;9;0;17;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1360-2357;1573-7608;NA;EDUC INF TECHNOL;Educ.

Gamification is increasingly gaining attention among system designers across various industries especially in education due to the benefits associated with its implementation. The adoption of gamification in information systems (IS) education is promising for engaging and motivating students to complete their degree programs. Call for research in this area is particularly on the increase in the IS field. Accordingly, we need to organize the aggregation of research in this area and use common terminologies to promote progressive research practice in the field. In this paper, we use a multi-method approach to systematically review existing research on gamification in IS education to identify common terminologies, identify trends in topics studied, highlight understudied areas, and, thus, present opportunities for future research. The multi-method approach combines classical systematic review method and social network analysis to provide additional insight into the knowledge structure of researchers involved in the gamification of IS education. This review also highlights possible interventions that can improve student retention in IS education through the design of effective gamified courses.;"[Osatuyi, Babajide] Penn State Univ, Sam & Irene Black Sch Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Osatuyi, Temidayo; de la Rosa, Ramiro] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Ctr Online Learning & Teaching Technol, Edinburg, TX USA";Osatuyi, B (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Sam & Irene Black Sch Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.;bosatuyi@psu.edu;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;71;4;4;1;5;ASSOC INFORMATION SYSTEMS;ATLANTA;GEORGIA STATE UNIV, 35 BROAD STREET, STE 916-917, ATLANTA, GA 30303 USA;1529-3181;NA;NA;COMMUN ASSOC INF SYS;Commun.

The application of gamification in a pedagogical context provides some remedy for many students who find themselves alienated by traditional methods of instruction. The use of gamification could provide a partial solution to the decline in learners' motivation and engagement the schooling system is facing today. Specifically, the college environment could benefit a lot from gamifying not only their graduate recruitment strategies, but also the college course content and curricula. This critical analysis of literature on gamification is intended to be part of a sequence on the effect of gamification on motivation and engagement. A proposed methodology in the study of gamification effect on motivation and engagement in addition to an empirical study on three college courses are being finalized to complete this trilogy. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Themes covered in the literature review include: conceptualizing gamification, advantages of gamification over game-based learning, theoretical connections to gamification, motivation and engagement, connecting gamification to motivation and engagement, emotions and fun in gamification, player types and gamification features, gamification in action, and implementation guidelines. Findings - The literature on the effect of gamification on motivation and gamification is still limited on multiple levels. There is a gap between theory and practice in the study of gamification. There is limited literature on the implementation guidelines of the gamified designs. Practical implications - This critical analysis of literature is followed by connecting it to future research by the same author as part of a sequence on the effect of gamification on motivation and engagement. The second project, will be proposing a methodology for any successful design to provide a holistic understanding of the topic of gamification. Finally, an empirical study on the effect of gamification on students' motivation and engagement in three college courses will be submitted to complete the trilogy. Originality/value - This paper is a literature review, so there is a strong connection to literature on this topic. However, the synthesis of the themes and ideas are original. The literature review is extensive and covers the different aspects of the topic of gamification and its relationship to motivation and engagement.;[Alsawaier, Raed S.] Washington State Univ, Dept Teaching & Learning, Pullman, WA 99164 USA;Alsawaier, RS (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Teaching & Learning, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.;raed.alsawaier@wsu.edu;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;123;54;58;9;123;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2056-4880;NA;NA;INT J INF LEARN TECH;Int.

However, relevant academic studies are not wide-spread and this study aims to address this vital research gap. This study is structured to understand the factors affecting intention to use gamified systems and test whether they are affected by gender or age. An online survey study was conducted on a web-based gamified system (EmpireAvenue.com) and following a detailed screening process, a total of 168 fully complete questionnaires were attained. The theoretical model employed was developed upon technology acceptance model (TAM) and modified to incorporate an intrinsic motivation element, namely the perceived enjoyment construct.

One of the innovative solutions offered by the Binational Laboratory to meet the training needs in this area is to offer a set of MOOCs (massive open online courses). This research is part of this project and aims to understand how the components of innovation (attributes) work in the instructional design of a MOOC, which integrates open educational resources (OER) and gamification, offered from January to March 2017. There are four components observed: the idea of the new, the phenomenon of change, the final action and the process. The method used was the mixed method, under a sequential explanatory design. As results, it was found that the attribute of the new is presented in a pedagogical model that integrates gamification, as well as in the presentation of content through high-impact short videos, infographics and OER. The phenomenon of change is understood through the integration of a multidisciplinary team around the issue of energy. The final action is present in the collaboration, communication and commitment of the specialists.

Among other techniques that are often applied by instructors to counteract this issue, those related to the use of gaming elements seem to very promising. In this context, considering the use of game-like properties in learning scenarios, known as gamification, has received increasing interest by academia in recent years. However, its application in higher education can be challenging, due to some unwanted effects caused by the lack of proven design methodologies have been detected. Choosing the adequate formal process for gamification design has become an important success requirement. This work presents a systematic review of the gamification design frameworks discussed in the literature, providing a useful resource to educational practitioners as well as gamification designers and researchers. A total of 2314 unique works are initially recorded, based on queries in databases, libraries, journals and search engines.

Moreover, recent investigations reported stereotype threat by gender had impacted students performance, in particular, the use of a male-dominant leaderboard affected women math performance. In this sense, we attained to conduct a hypothetical study to investigate whether gender stereotype threat in online gamified educational scenarios influences anxiety and performance. We conducted a three-stage survey where participants were asked indirectly about their anxiety, then they were redirected to a hypothetical online gamified system to solve a logic quiz. Afterward, their anxiety was assessed one more time in order to find out how much it had changed. We found evidence indicating the male-stereotyped environment affected participants' anxiety.

However, research to date consistently reports poor user engagement and retention. The current study examined user engagement, compliance and retention with Active Team-a gamified physical activity intervention delivered by via an online Facebook application. Associations between engagement and participant (n = 51) demographic and team characteristics (sex, age, education and team size) were examined, as well as temporal trends in engagement during the 50-day intervention. Analyses revealed significant associations between both engagement (p = <0.001) and gamification (p = 0.04) with education, with participants in the middle education category appearing to have the highest rates of engagement and use of gamification features. Gender was also related to engagement, with males demonstrating the highest use of the intervention's gamification features (p = 0.004). Although compliance was consistently high for the duration, engagement declined steadily throughout the intervention. Engagement peaked on Wednesdays, coinciding with the delivery of a customised email reminder. Findings reveal individual differences in engagement with Active Team, highlighting a need to tailor interventions to the target audience. Gamification features may enhance engagement amongst males, who are traditionally recognised as a difficult demographic group to engage. Finally, the use of customised, periodic push reminders delivered by email may enhance user engagement by drawing them back to the intervention and helping to sustain intervention behaviours.;"[Ryan, Jillian; Edney, Sarah; Maher, Carol] Univ South Australia, Alliance Res Exercise Nutr & Act, GPO Box 2471, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia";Ryan, J (corresponding author), Univ South Australia, Alliance Res Exercise Nutr & Act, GPO Box 2471, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.;jillian.ryan@unisa.edu.au;Maher, Carol/C-8169-2009;Maher, Carol/0000-0002-8676-0224;Australian National Heart FoundationNational Heart Foundation of Australia [100188];Carol Maher is the recipient of a Post-Doctoral Fellowship Award from the Australian National Heart Foundation (100188).;NA;24;12;12;1;28;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;1869-6716;1613-9860;NA;TRANSL BEHAV MED;Transl.

Indeed, their behaviour could be one of the reasons behind the energy 'performance gap' observed in many buildings. Moreover, informed building users can promote the sustainability agenda through their consumer choices. This, however, raises the issue of understanding the energy performance of buildings. This paper presents an exercise on developing and testing a computer game which introduces players to the basic concepts of building energy performance. A software application was developed to visualise post-occupancy evaluation data in a dynamic three-dimensional context. A pilot study was used for assessing and fine-tuning the methodology, followed by the main study of two workshops with two different user groups: non-experts and entry-level specialists. The results are presented using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The findings suggest that the advantages and challenges of 'gamification' described in the literature are generally confirmed by the tentative evidence of this exercise. In addition, the process highlights the potential of novel ways of presenting building data in enabling more stakeholders to engage with the issue of building energy performance.;"[Patlakas, Panagiotis] Birmingham City Univ, Fac Comp Engn & Built Environm, Civil Engn, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Raslan, Rokia] UCL, Bartlett, Inst Environm Design & Engn, Environm Design & Engn, London, England";Patlakas, P (corresponding author), Birmingham City Univ, Fac Comp Engn & Built Environm, Civil Engn, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.;panagiotis.patlakas@bcu.ac.uk;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;74;2;2;2;43;ICE PUBLISHING;WESTMINISTER;INST CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1 GREAT GEORGE ST, WESTMINISTER SW 1P 3AA, ENGLAND;1478-4629;1751-7680;NA;P I CIVIL ENG-ENG SU;Proc.

This work presents a gamification experience within prospective primary teachers in a General Science Classroom. A scoring game-based methodology was used for teaching Matter and Energy contents. In an effort for promoting collaborative dynamics rather than competitive ones in the entire group, a new variable was introduced once the game was started. It was called Game-Index and took into account the scoring of the whole class, similarly to H-Index. The results evidenced the need for these correcting measures in the gamifications processes, since a positive correlation amongst scoring and academic marks was confirmed, but also some kind of competitive-by segreggation inside the class group.;"[Sanchez-Martin, Jesus; Canada-Canada, Florentina; Antonia Davila-Acedo, Maria] Univ Extremadura, Fac Educ, Dept Sci & Math Educ, Avda Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain";Sanchez-Martin, J (corresponding author), Univ Extremadura, Fac Educ, Dept Sci & Math Educ, Avda Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain.;jsanmar@unex.es;"Canada, Florentina Canada/O-4254-2015; Sanchez, Jesus/I-7195-2013";"Canada, Florentina Canada/0000-0001-5544-0423; Sanchez, Jesus/0000-0003-4384-6738";"Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain [EDU2016-77007-R]; Government of Extremadura [GR15009]; FEDEREuropean Commission [GR15009]";This work was financed by Research Project EDU2016-77007-R (AEI/FEDER, UE) of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain and GR15009 of the Government of Extremadura and FEDER.;NA;22;30;31;4;49;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;1871-1871;1878-0423;NA;THINK SKILLS CREAT;Think.

The theory of gamified learning (Landers, 2014) posits that gamified approaches positively impact students' attitudes, and in turn this change in attitudes impacts learning; however, research is needed to examine the role of attitude change in gamified approaches (Seaborn & Fels, 2014). A strong negative relationship between students' attitudes towards statistics and their performance in statistics has been well documented. The need to help students have positive attitudes towards statistics, and therefore be more likely to achieve in the course, makes using gamified learning, which targets attitudes, an ideal domain to test the effects of gamification on attitudes. Methods. The aim in this quasi-experimental study was to examine the ability of gamified modules in a statistics course to have positive impacts on learning and attitudes towards statistics. Students in the experimental group were compared to previous cohorts completing the same course, but without the gamified exercises as well as published results from a large cohort of comparable students. Results. The attitudes of cognitive competence, affect, value and perceived difficulty were all positively impacted after completing the gamified exercises. The experimental group also had large effects of test performance one semester after completing the course. Conclusion. In line with the theory of gamified learning, these findings suggested that the gamified modules were successful in shifting students' attitudes in a positive direction and subsequently increasing performance. Future studies should introduce randomization between students and examine the specific pathways between attitudes and performance.";[Smith, Tamarah] Cabrini Univ, Psychol, Radnor, PA 19087 USA;Smith, T (corresponding author), Cabrini Univ, Dept Psychol, 610 King Prussia Rd, Radnor, PA 19087 USA.;tfs722@cabrini.edu;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;63;8;8;2;25;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;1046-8781;1552-826X;NA;SIMULAT GAMING;Simul.

This paper describes the development and evaluation of an innovative 3D virtual reality (VR) training application to support learning these skills. Methods: The VR ophthalmoscope was developed by a clinical team and technologist using the unity game engine, smartphone and virtual reality headset. It has a series of tasks that include performing systematic eye examinations, identifying common eye pathologies and a knowledge quiz. As part of their clinical training, 15 fourth-year medical students were surveyed for their views on this teaching approach. The Technology Acceptance Model was used to evaluate perceived usefulness and ease of use. Data were also collected on the usability of the app, together with the students' written comments about it. Results: Users agreed that the teaching approach improved their understanding of ophthalmoscopy (n = 14), their ability to identify landmarks in the eye (n = 14) and their ability to recognise abnormalities (n = 15). They found the app easy to use (n = 15), the teaching approach informative (n = 13) and that it would increase students' confidence when performing these tasks in future (n = 15). Discussion: The evaluation showed that a VR app can successfully simulate the processes involved in performing eye examinations. The app was highly rated for all elements of perceived usefulness, ease of use and usability.

DESIGN: In July 2016, we instituted a gamified microblogging project using Twitter as the platform and modified questions from one of several available question banks. A question of the day was posted at 7-o'clock each morning, Monday through Friday. Respondents were awarded points for speed, accuracy, and contribution to discussion topics. The moderator challenged respondents by asking additional questions and prompted them to find evidence for their claims to fuel further discussion. Since 4 months into the microblogging program, a survey was administered to all residents. Responses were collected and analyzed. After 6 months of tweeting, residents took the ABSITE examination. We compared participating residents' ABSITE percentile rank to those of their nonparticipating peers. We also compared residents' percentile rank from 2016 to those in 2017 after their participation in the microblogging project. SETTING: The University of Connecticut general surgery residency is an integrated program that is decentralized across 5 hospitals in the central Connecticut region, including Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center, located in Hartford. PARTICIPANTS: We advertised our account to the University of Connecticut general surgery residents. Out of 45 residents, 11 participated in Twitter microblogging (24.4%) and 17 responded to the questionnaire (37.8%). RESULTS: In all, 100% of the residents who were participating in Twitter reported that daily microblogging prompted them to engage in academic reading. Twitter participants significantly increased their ABSITE percentile rank from 2016 to 2017 by an average of 13.7% (14.1%) while nonparticipants on average decreased their ABSITE percentile rank by 10.0% (16.6) (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Microblogging via Twitter with gamification is a feasible strategy to facilitate improving performance on the ABSITE, especially in a geographically distributed residency.

The literature reveals that conventional Science teaching techniques (teacher-centered lecture and teaching), which foster rote learning among students, are one of the major concerns in Pakistan Education system. This leads to student disengagement in science lessons eventually resulting in student absenteeism and dropouts from the schools. This study consisted of five stages: (1) examining the impact of Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL) and gamification on engagement, learning and gender difference, and literature related to using DGBL models for instructional design; (2) planning learning activities and developing a GBL application based on a specific content in Science; (3) conducting an intervention with a sample of 72 participants of 8th grade (aged 12-15) in a low cost private school of Pakistan following quasi-experimental research framework; (4) observing behaviour and emotions of the participants during science lessons; (5) conducting pre and post tests to assess the learning outcomes of participants followed by focus groups discussion. Analysis from Friedman test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test show that the GBL application has a positive influence on student engagement. However, GBL application was not equally effective for all students since girls outperformed boys in terms of engagement and learning outcomes.

In order to bridge the skill shortage gap at a tertiary level, the Stellenbosch Learning Factory (SLF) was established. Learning factories involve experiential learning in a production environment through 'learning by doing'. Gamification, one of the teaching methods used in the SLF, is investigated as a possible answer to South Africa's educational problems. Learning factories can be used to train employees: the knowledge transfer resulting from real production conditions is favoured because process improvements can be implemented or practised without any real production downtime. The aim of this study was to determine the learning contribution of the games implemented at the SLF. This was accomplished by developing a three-dimensional matrix that employs a revised version of Bloom's taxonomy to measure the learning success of the educational games at the SLF.;"[Henning, M.; Hagedorn-Hansen, D.; von Leipzig, K.

Implicit skills such as abnormality detection require repeated practice on clinical service and have few digital substitutes. Using mechanics traditionally deployed in video games such as clearly defined goals, rapid-fire levels, and narrow time constraints may be an effective way to teach implicit skills. Materials and Methods: We created a freely available, online module to evaluate the ability of individuals to differentiate between normal and abnormal chest radiographs by implementing mechanics, including instantaneous feedback, rapid-fire cases, and 15-second timers. Volunteer subjects completed the modules and were separated based on formal experience with chest radiography. Performance between training and testing sets were measured for each group, and a survey was administered after each session. Results: The module contained 74 cases and took approximately 20 minutes to complete. Thirty-two cases were normal radiographs and 56 cases were abnormal. Of the 60 volunteers recruited, 25 were never trained and 35 were previously trained. Never trained users scored 21.9 out of 37 during training and 24.0 out of 37 during testing (59.1% vs 64.9%, P value <.001). Previously trained users scored 28.0 out of 37 during training and 28.3 out of 37 during testing phases (75.6% vs 76.4%, P value = .56). Survey results showed that 87% of all subjects agreed the module is an efficient way of learning, and 83% agreed the rapid-fire module is valuable for medical students. Conclusions: A gamified online module may improve the abnormality detection rates of novice interpreters of chest radiography, although experienced interpreters are less likely to derive similar benefits.

Taking into consideration the linguistic needs of students with different sociolinguistic backgrounds is a significant challenge for teachers. ICTs may be helpful for teachers facing such challenges, even though there are contrasting opinions about their usage in the classroom.

One of the approaches to this type of innovation consists of using the platforms where MOOCs are hosted for the development of courses that are aligned to their on-campus curricular contents. They are known as Small Private Online Courses (SPOCs), which allow online access to knowledge for groups of students with a well-defined profile. The platforms where MOOCs (and SPOCs) are hosted have been designed to support large volumes of data and visits. However, these platforms present important limitations regarding the implementation of collaborative learning activities. To address this problem, this article presents MyMOOCSpace, a cloud-based mobile system aimed at supporting effective collaboration in MOOCs, by combining key aspects of collaboration from the research area of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) with game-based dynamics. MyMOOCSpace has been tested in three quasi-experiments that were run in four Latin-American universities with a total of 68 participants. The objective was to assess its usability and its effect in enhancing collaboration among students in a SPOC. The results obtained on usability show that MyMOOCSpace is easy to use, and that participants felt pleased with while using it.

Place attachment refers to the relationship between people and places, which has numerous benefits for individual well-being. Popular location-based AR games often include elements that are known to predict place attachment: exploration, social relations or the experience of enjoyment in a place. We argue that positive emotions triggered by playing can influence players' place attachment via the process of gamification. We tested this hypothesis in a correlational study conducted among Pokemon Go players. Our analyses showed that satisfaction from playing and the social relations made during play positively predict place attachment, but the amount of time spent on playing does not. A series of mediation analyses showed that relations among game satisfaction, social relations, and place attachment were mediated by the appraisal of the place as exciting. This study demonstrated a mechanism of emotional transfer between positive experiences from playing and place attachment, which may prove useful in other domains, such as education, land conservation, or marketing.

The focus is on best practice approaches when enhancing student engagement, how to adjust those to the diversity of learners, learning situations and infrastructures, and to a broad range of subjects. The need for authentic learning and to move away from didactic teaching is emphasized. The 'students as researchers' theme is featured e.g. in context of service learning. Creative approaches are presented such as using performing arts, popular culture and gamification. The development of interdisciplinary and intercultural competences, and the exploration of socioscientific themes and philosophical issues are considered. Revisions of curricula and programmes, reflective of educational advancements and sector drivers, are discussed from undergraduate to postgraduate and professional specialist level also in light of problem-based learning, interactive distance and on-campus learning, and even the legacy of Massive Open Online Courses.

Despite increasing academic research exploring the use of gamification in education little is known about teachers' main drivers and barriers to using gamification in their courses. Using a phenomenology approach, 16 online structured interviews were conducted in order to explore the main drivers that encourage teachers serving in Higher Education institutions to using gamification in their courses. The main barriers that prevent teachers from using gamification were also analysed. Four main drivers (attention-motivation, entertainment, interactivity, and easiness to learn) and four main barriers (lack of resources, students' apathy, subject fit, and classroom dynamics) were identified. Results suggest that teachers perceive the use of gamification both as beneficial but also as a potential risk for classroom atmosphere. Managerial recommendations for managers of Higher Education institutions, limitations of the study, and future research lines are also addressed.;"[Sanchez-Mena, Antonio; Marti-Parreno, Jose] Univ Europea Valencia, Valencia, Spain; [Sanchez-Mena, Antonio] Univ Europea Canarias, Tenerife, Spain";Marti-Parreno, J (corresponding author), Univ Europea Valencia, Valencia, Spain.;"antonio.sanchezmena@universidadeuropea.es; jose.marti@universidadeuropea.es";"Marti-Parreno, Jose/AAY-4787-2020; MARTI-PARRENO, JOSE/K-9311-2014";MARTI-PARRENO, JOSE/0000-0001-5928-7956;Laureate International Universities through the David A.

However, there have been few comparisons of different kinds of courses and students, particularly in terms of discipline and content. Additionally, little work has reported on course instructor/designer perspectives. Finally, few studies on gamification have used a conceptual framework to assess the impact on student engagement. This paper reports on findings from evaluating two gamified multimedia and social media undergraduate courses over the course of one semester. Findings from applying a multidimensional framework suggest that the gamification approach taken was moderately effective for students overall, with some elements being more engaging than others in general and for each course over time. Post-term questionnaires posed to the instructors/course designers revealed congruence with the student perspective and several challenges pre- and post-implementation, despite the use of established rules for gamifying curricula.;"[Seaborn, Katie] UCL, Comp Sci, London, England; [Fels, Deborah I.] Ryerson Univ, Ted Rogers Sch Management, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Bajko, Rob] Mt St Vincent Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Hodson, Jaigris] Royal Rd Univ, Off Interdisciplinary Studies, Victoria, BC, Canada";Seaborn, K (corresponding author), UCL, Comp Sci, London, England.;NA;NA;Hodson, Jaigris/0000-0002-2235-3718;Ryerson University Learning & Teaching Enhancement Fund;Thanks to Megan Burnett (University of Toronto) for a critical early review of this paper.

Student perceptions were obtained through pre- and post-survey instruments consisting of selected questions from the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. Findings: The response rate was 69% (106/153). At baseline, 53% of respondents agreed that digital badges could help them better understand course material. More students agreed they would share earned digital badges on LinkedIn (68%) than Facebook (19%). Most students who earned digital badges agreed that badges helped increase their confidence in course material (73%), focus on specific learning objectives (55%), look deeper into course competencies (64%), and were a useful adjunct to the traditional teaching method (82%).

The objective of the paper is to propose a model for a gamified platform for online education that contributes to a more participatory learning, taking into account the different student profiles. Based on literature review about approaches to gamification systems design, a set of steps was followed in order to develop a generic model for a framework dedicated to online education. The model proposed is based on the Educational Gamification Design Principles proposed by Dicheva et al. (2015).

Digital games are rapidly becoming an important tool for improving health behaviors and supporting the delivery of care and education. The purpose of this review is to provide a historical context for the use of gamification and videogames (including those using virtual reality) used in technology-based HIV interventions and to review new research in the field. Recent findings A review of recently published (1 January 2016-31 March 2017) or presented abstracts (2016) identified a paucity of technology-based interventions that included gamification elements or any terms associated with videogames or gameplay. A larger portfolio of digital gaming interventions is in the pipeline. Summary Use of digital games that include elements of gamification or consist of standalone videogames or virtual-reality-based games, represent a promising intervention strategy to address the HIV prevention and care continuum, especially among youth.

But it doesn't mean it cannot be treated as one! Fear of bad grades has never been the best way to motivate students. Often teaching activities are performed using the repetition of a model obtained with own experience as a student or, in the best cases, by trying to avoid the worst practices personally acknowledged as the most negative ones. The final goal - the diploma, at the end of the long university journey seems too distant to keep high morals during study. Here comes the question: how to prompt students to learning? Gamification, a term that applies almost solely to entertainment, is a way of engaging people's competitive drive and applying it to achieve their better performance. My ideas, described in the following paper, are basing on my own thoughts on games, mainly World of Warcraft and possible applications in university environment. In the World of Warcraft from the very first minute you start playing, the game constantly dangles a carrot on a stick in front of you. It could be a new ability, a powerful sword, or a cool mechanical chicken to ride on. Whatever it is, it's always just attainable enough that you'll say just one more quest! . Short and clearly marked steps allows player to monitor his progress and gives knowledge how to reach next level. Last but not least games have been primarily focused on competition, but nowadays it is also about cooperation to earn new achievements - both also most wanted in the didactics.

Nevertheless, teachers might face several barriers that dissuade them from using educational video games in their courses. This study analyses factors affecting teachers' behavioural intention to use educational video games in their courses using a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) approach. The research model is tested via structural equation modelling (SEM) on a sample of 312 teachers in Higher Education institutions. Results suggest that perceived usefulness influences in a direct and positive way teachers' intention to use educational video games. Results also suggest that perceived ease of use indirectly influence intentions through perceived usefulness. Age was found to moderate the effect of teachers' perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness of EVGs. Regarding managerial implications, our findings highlight the importance of addressing specific Teacher Training Programmes focusing on teachers' age and perceived usefulness of EVGs in order to encourage teachers to adopting this educational innovation in their courses. Limitations of the study and future research lines are also addressed.;"[Sanchez-Mena, Antonio; Marti-Parreno, Jose] Univ Europea Valencia, Valencia, Spain; [Sanchez-Mena, Antonio] Univ Europea Canarias, Tenerife, Spain; [Aldas-Manzano, Joaquin] Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain";"Sanchez-Mena, A (corresponding author), Univ Europea Valencia, Valencia, Spain.; Sanchez-Mena, A (corresponding author), Univ Europea Canarias, Tenerife, Spain.";"antonio.sanchezmena@universidadeuropea.es; jose.marti@universidadeuropea.es; joaquin.aldas@uv.es";"Aldas-Manzano, Joaquin/K-7566-2017; Marti-Parreno, Jose/AAY-4787-2020; MARTI-PARRENO, JOSE/K-9311-2014";"Aldas-Manzano, Joaquin/0000-0001-8327-6640; MARTI-PARRENO, JOSE/0000-0001-5928-7956";Laureate International Universities through the David A.

Gamification is growing in popularity in education and workplace training, but it is unclear which game elements are conducive to learning. The theory of gamified learning suggests that one type of gamification, the addition of game fiction/narrative, can be used to improve learning outcomes, and the Technology-Enhanced Training Effectiveness Model (TETEM) suggests individual differences impact the strength of this effect. From this theoretical basis, this study gamified a training module with game fiction in order to improve outcomes over the original training. Results and Conclusion. In a study of 273 learners, trainees were significantly more satisfied with training enhanced with game fiction over the control text (d = 0.65) but did not differ in declarative knowledge scores by condition. Further, trainees in the control condition scored higher on procedural knowledge than trainees in the game fiction condition, although the effect was smaller (d = -0.40). Thus, the use of narrative improved reactions to training but at some cost to training effectiveness. Attitudes toward game-based learning were also tested as a moderator of the condition-outcome relationship.;"[Armstrong, Michael B.; Landers, Richard N.] Old Dominion Univ, 250 Mills Godwin Bldg, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA";Armstrong, MB (corresponding author), Old Dominion Univ, 250 Mills Godwin Bldg, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.;marms018@odu.edu;NA;Landers, Richard/0000-0001-5611-2923;NA;NA;NA;59;27;28;2;33;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;1046-8781;1552-826X;NA;SIMULAT GAMING;Simul.

Multimodal conversational agents have became a strong alternative to develop human-machine interfaces that provide a more engaging and human-like relationship between students and the system. The main developers of operating systems for such devices have provided application programming interfaces for developers to implement their own applications, including different solutions for developing graphical interfaces, sensor control and voice interaction. Despite the usefulness of such resources, there are no strategies defined for coupling the multimodal interface with the possibilities that these devices offer to enhance mobile educative apps with intelligent communicative capabilities and adaptation to the user needs.

Most research in this field has been conducted in more economically advanced and developed regions, and there is a paucity of research in emerging country contexts. It is argued that gamification can be effectively utilised in these contexts to address learner engagement and motivation. The study investigated the extent to which six determined predictors (perceptions about playfulness, curriculum fit, learning opportunities, challenge, self-efficacy and computer anxiety) influence the advocacy to accept a gamified application by South African tourism teachers. Tourism education was selected for empirical study because of its popularity in developing countries and where the economy heavily depends on the sector. However, it is a highly under researched area. Data was obtained from 209 tourism teachers, and was tested against the research model using a structural equation modelling approach. Findings reveal that the constructs of perceived playfulness, curriculum fit have a positive, direct impact on the construct of behavioural intention. The exogenous constructs of challenge, learning opportunities, self-efficacy and computer anxiety have an indirect effect on behavioural intention via perceived playfulness or curriculum fit. The study may prove useful to educators and practitioners in understanding which determinants may influence the introduction of gamification into formal secondary education. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Netland (2013), based on a study of production systems in 30 firms, considered that all production systems share the same principles and that these are similar to the Lean system's principles. From its beginnings, the Lean system has evolved and spread to all sectors, and, although it is not the objective of this contribution to explain the scope of Lean, we can confirm that the literature still has no agreed definition of Lean production and, in some way, the general purpose formulations of the concept diverge. However, it is clear that the roots of Lean production should be acquired by future engineers for them to become Lean Thinkers. Understanding and assimilating these concepts on the theoretical level can be complex and so adequate tools need to be employed. We aimed to do this through gamification with LEGO (c) sets. Gamification has evolved from activity based learning and is an innovative learning system designed to improve knowledge through experience. It is the process of adding games or game- like elements to something (such as a task) to encourage participation. The Lean Management concepts we worked with were (1) Production based on takt time, (2) Process synchronization, (3) Small lot production, (4) Waste elimination, (5) Setup time reduction, (6) Lead time reduction (7) Cross training, (8) Employee involvement, (9) 5S, (10) Standardized work, (11) Visual control and Management and (12) Supplier involvement. The experience consisted of building a small LEGO (c) structure and designing a balanced production line. The main aim was for students to acquire knowledge from the experience by highlighting ways to improve the production system and avoid waste through better planning and by applying some Lean practices. The experience was a complete success in terms of student involvement, and enjoyed satisfactory results in terms of Lean concept acquisition. In Conclusions, we categorize which Lean concepts were more easily consolidated through the game and propose improvements for subsequent experiences. Although the students acquired high levels of the abovementioned concepts, there were four concepts that did not meet the learning objective: Production based on takt time, Small lot production, Setup time reduction and Cross training. The problem was students did not have a standard framework within which to solve the case and, while proposing the concept of creating an innovative production system was solid, the lack of a standard framework made it difficult to compare the different solutions presented by the students. We hope this teaching experience will encourage Production and Operation management lecturers to adapt their lessons to this fascinating new way of teaching management concepts.;[Gimenez Leal, Gerusa] Escuela Politecn Super, Seville, Spain;NA;"rudi.castro@udg.edu; gerusa.gimenez@udg.edu";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;11;0;0;0;26;UNIV POLITECNICA MADRID-CEPADE;MADRID;AVE BRASIL, 23, MADRID, 28020, SPAIN;1132-175X;2171-6323;NA;DIR ORGAN;Dir.

The study used exploratory research and survey as the data collection tool. Forty-seven graduate students (n = 47) enrolled in an instructional technology program studied in a learning management system that supports gamification (TalentLMS). The average total percentages were calculated for each survey section to compose the final perspective of the included students. The results showed a positive perception toward the use of gamification tools in online learning among graduate students.

One novel approach is to train parents to use evidence-based interventions for their child with ASD via telehealth. Pilot work examining the efficacy of one such program, ImPACT Online, demonstrated a high rate of parent program engagement, low attrition, and associated gains in parent learning and child social communication. Objective: The objective of this study was to conduct an open trial of ImPACT Online to better understand its dissemination potential. Methods: We examined the reach and representativeness of families who registered (n=36) compared to families who were referred (n=139) to the open trial for one referral site. We then compared the demographics of all families who enrolled in the open trial (n=112) to families who enrolled in one of two controlled trials of the same program (n=50). We also examined metrics of program engagement for the open and controlled trials, the relationship between program engagement and changes in parents' intervention knowledge, and program evaluation for the participants in the open trial. Results: In total, 25.8% (36/139) of the parents who were given information about the program at their child's diagnostic feedback session registered with the program. The parents who enrolled in the open (OT) and controlled trials (CT), respectively, were similar in gender (OT: 84.8% (95/112); CT: 88% (44/50), female), marital status (OT: 80.4% (90/112); CT: 69.6% (32/46), married), education (OT: 58.0% (65/112); CT: 54.0% (27/50), college degree or higher), and employment status (OT: 58.0% (65/112); CT: 65.3% (32/49), employed outside the home). The child participants were similar in terms of gender (OT: 83.0% (93/112); CT: 76.0% (38/50), male) and race and ethnicity (OT: 38.4% (43/112); CT: 24.0% (12/50), minority). However, the mean chronological age of the child participants in the open trial group was significantly higher (Mean=60.0 months) than in the controlled trial group (Mean=43.0 months), with t(160)=5.22, P<.001. Parents in the open trial engaged with the program at a significantly lower rate than the controlled trial, F-3,F-81=21.14, P<.001. Program engagement was significantly associated with gains in parent intervention knowledge across both the groups, beta=.41, t=2.43, P=.02. Participants in the open access trial evaluated the program highly, but several barriers were noted.

To date, despite growing interest and some initial attempts, their potential to engage consumers in energy efficiency behaviours has been understudied. To provide an overview of serious games and gamification to engage individuals in pro-environmental behaviours for energy efficiency, a computer-based search for relevant publications was performed in several databases. After applying the inclusion criteria and removing duplicates, 10 papers were included in this systematic review. Results showed that serious games and gamification have been used in three different areas related to energy efficiency: environmental education, consumption awareness, and pro-environmental behaviours. This review also showed that applied gaming interventions can be used in more than one of these three areas (comprehensive interventions). The main observation to be drawn from this review is that both serious games and gamification can foster energy-saving behaviours and vary widely in terms of type of games and of features that might be appealing and motivating.;"[Morganti, Luca; Pallavicini, Federica; Cadel, Elena; Mantovani, Fabrizia] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Human Sci Educ Riccardo Massa, Ctr Studies Commun Sci CESCOM, Milan, Italy; [Candelieri, Antonio; Archetti, Francesco] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Comp Sci Syst & Commun, Milan, Italy; [Archetti, Francesco] Consorzio Milano Ric, Milan, Italy";Morganti, L (corresponding author), Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Human Sci Educ Riccardo Massa, Ctr Studies Commun Sci CESCOM, Milan, Italy.;lucafmorganti@gmail.com;"/AAI-7627-2021; Pallavicini, Federica/AAN-3749-2020";"/0000-0003-1431-576X; Pallavicini, Federica/0000-0003-2064-3823; MANTOVANI, FABRIZIA/0000-0003-4772-9109";NA;NA;NA;67;48;48;10;48;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;2214-6296;2214-6326;NA;ENERGY RES SOC SCI;Energy Res.

The experiments were used to engage students to ask more questions in class. The results indicated that gamified designs were effective in engaging people who were bashful or distracted. In addition, students were engaged more easily in social circumstances through a comparison of individual and social interactions.

However, the mechanisms of attention and processing of their contents and their consequences in learning have not been sufficiently studied. The objective of this work is to analyze how information is processed and learned and how visual attention takes place. It also investigates the existence of gender differences. The responses to 15 images are analyzed using Eye Tracking and EEG in a sample of 22 young students. The recall and liking of the stimuli is also analyzed. The characteristics of the images are evaluated by experts. The results indicate that there is a different pattern of visual activity between men and women which does not affect subsequent recall. The recall is determined by the emotional value of the image and its simplicity: more complex images demand more time of visual fixation but are less remembered. EEG responses confirm the importance of the playful component of the memory and low involvement processing. The conclusion is that the behavior against an app of this type resembles the low commitment behavior of advertising itself.

In order to solve this problem, we connect the time in class and after class with semantic knowledge and combine these elements with gamification and a better interaction experience. We explore whether this teaching method can offer students a better learning experience and positive learning outcomes. Our approach plays an obvious role in personalised learning.

While many fields such as Business, Marketing and e-Learning have taken advantage of the potential of gamification, the digital healthcare domain has also started to exploit this emerging trend. This paper aims to summarize the current knowledge regarding gamified e-Health applications. A systematic literature review was therefore conducted to explore the various gamification strategies employed in e-Health and to address the benefits and the pitfalls of this emerging discipline. A total of 46 studies from multiple sources were then considered and thoroughly investigated. The results show that the majority of the papers selected reported gamification and serious gaming in health and wellness contexts related specifically to chronic disease rehabilitation, physical activity and mental health. Although gamification in e-Health has attracted a great deal of attention during the last few years, there is still a dearth of valid empirical evidence in this field. Moreover, most of the e-Health applications and serious games investigated have been proven to yield solely short-term engagement through extrinsic rewards. For gamification to reach its full potential, it is therefore necessary to build e-Health solutions on well-founded theories that exploit the core experience and psychological effects of game mechanics.

Objective: To improve healthy lifestyle habits in university students through an educational intervention based on gamification. Method: A cuasiexperimental design of two groups (i.e., experimental groups and control group) with pretest and postest measurements was carried out. A 4-month intervention was implemented in 148 students from the Physical Activity and Sport Sciences university degree. Habits related to diet and physical activity were evaluated using a questionnaire (scaled from -40 a +50) and the teaching-learning process through a qualitative analysis. Results: At the end of the intervention, a very signifi cant improvement was found in the global value of the healthy lifestyle habits of the experimental group (+13,5), highlighting the improvement obtained in its higher level of compliance in the breakfast (53,4%), in the number of diary meals (31,5%), in the reduction of the consumption of soft-drinks (19,2%) and in the increase of physical activity level, with an improvement of 12,3% of participants with respect to the baseline levels.

Nevertheless, during teen years, playing games have often been stigmatized as a waste of time. Thus, the phenomenon of gamification has become recently a methodological trend with a relevant presence in the classroom. In this paper, an analysis of previous work in gamification is performed in primary and secondary education. Next, the experience carried out at a secondary school in Barcelona is described where a program has been implemented ad hoc to teach, in a playful way, contents of digital systems in the context of the Industrial Technology course in secondary school. The results of the experience and the students' opinion that have been positive are summarized in this paper.;"[Diez Rioja, Jesus Carlos] Inst Quatre Cantons, Barcelona, Spain; [Baneres Besora, David; Serra Vizem, Montse] Univ Oberta Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain";Rioja, JCD (corresponding author), Inst Quatre Cantons, Barcelona, Spain.;"carlos.diez@4cantons.cat; dbaneres@uoc.edu; mserravi@uoc.edu";"Serra, Montse/AAA-5660-2019; Baneres, David/AAG-4313-2021";Baneres, David/0000-0002-0380-1319;NA;NA;NA;19;1;1;1;13;EDICIONES UNIV SALAMANCA;SALAMANCA;APARTADO DE CORREOS 325, SALAMANCA, 00000, SPAIN;2444-8729;NA;NA;EDUC KNOWL SOC;Educ.

While empirical studies on gamification in higher education are showing modest gains in some areas, this data can be difficult to interpret because of the many ways that gamification can be designed and implemented. Gamification is also controversial for appearing exploitative, seeming over-simplified, and having the tendency to rely on extrinsic motivation and learning analytics that may not translate to student learning. This paper provides a brief overview of gamification in higher education and looks at findings from recent empirical studies. It then examines its key criticisms as well as its potential contributions to improving instructional design in higher education. A practical example and a set of recommendations are provided to show how instructors new to gamification and interested in implementing it can adapt it for their courses.;[Hung, Aaron Chia Yuan] Adelphi Univ, Garden City, NY USA;Hung, ACY (corresponding author), Adelphi Univ, Garden City, NY USA.;NA;Hung, Aaron Chia Yuan/J-3712-2019;Hung, Aaron Chia Yuan/0000-0002-6217-8993;NA;NA;NA;41;13;15;1;18;NATL CENTER ONLINE LEARNING RESEARCH;TUSCALOOSA;C/O VIVIAN H WRIGHT, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, UNIV ALABAMA, COLL EDUCATION, TUSCALOOSA, AL 35401 USA;1541-4914;NA;NA;J INTERACT ONLINE LE;J.

In this research, the peace context was used as a mediator for learning the English language. The study aimed to reveal the impact of learning through technology in the English language. It was conducted on five-year-old children (n = 18) in one class where the English language was the core subject. The acquisition of knowledge depended on in-class gamification activities and home activities. Each participant received an educational DVD to use at home that included all the materials for learning, such as words, songs, videos, and short films about peace in English. All materials were selected in according with the fair use policy for educational purposes. The research process included an initial interview (checklist) in which content analyses were made.

In the context of virtual education, a question that remains to be solved is associated with the level of motivation possessed by the students during the course. Usually, at the School of Engineering in the University of Medellin, this issue is tackled through activities such as chats and forums. Mostly, these activities are not enough to motivate the student in the activities related with the learning process. This work proposes two motivation strategies based on gamification and constructivism. These strategies are validated in a course called programming fundamentals, taught to all bachelor degrees given in the School of Engineering. Results obtained through the experiments suggest that proposed strategies improve the student's performance and satisfaction in the course. Therefore, when teaching at the virtual scenario, using Information and Communication Technologies in the educational environment is not only the way to contact the student, it is the mean to develop pedagogical-didactic approaches that finally enrich the educational process and consequently motivate the student to perform well.;"[Gonzalez, L.; Gomez, M.

However, problems exist in current learning recommender systems available to students in that they are often general learning content and unable to offer personalized service. To overcome this, in the context of a learning style based on an Interpretive Structural Model (ISM), an adaptive learning path recommendation system is proposed comprising: (a) Fuzzy Delphi Method, (b) Fuzzy ISM and (c) Kelly Repertory Grid Technology. The results show that the learning outcome with ALPRS is better than those from general learning course guided recommendation mechanisms, and the scores of system satisfaction with ALPRS and personal service are higher than 90%. Results of recall (95%), precision (68%), F1 index (45%) and MAE (8%) prove that ALPRS outperforms other approaches. Finally, three contributions are offered in this study:(1) a novel hybrid ALPRS is proposed and its practicability is tested; (2) a prototype gamification geometry-teaching material module is developed for the promotion in MSTE (Mathematics, Science and Technology Education) areas; (3) the adaptive geometry-learning path diagram generated with ISM based on learning styles could offer a basis for further studies.";[Su, Chung-Ho] SHU TE Univ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Su, CH (corresponding author), SHU TE Univ, Dept Animat & Game Design, 59 Hengshan Rd, Kaohsiung 82445, Taiwan.;mic6033@stu.edu.tw;NA;NA;National Science Council of the Republic of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 104-2622-H-366 -001 -CC3];This study is supported by the National Science Council of the Republic of China under contract numbers MOST 104-2622-H-366 -001 -CC3.;NA;66;10;10;0;57;MODESTUM LTD;LONDON;STE 124 CHALLENGE HOUSE 616 MITCHAM RD, CROYDON, LONDON, CRO 3AA, ENGLAND;1305-8215;1305-8223;NA;EURASIA J MATH SCI T;Eurasia J.

However, little is known about how different students experience and are engaged by it. We present a long-term study which identified distinct behavioral and performance patterns in participants taking a gamified college course. Our study lasted for three years, during which we deployed three consecutive instances of the course, each featuring improvements based on student feedback from the previous instances. To understand how different students behaved in our gamified experience, according to their daily performance, we performed cluster analysis and assessed student engagement in the last year using a formal instrument. We then did a cluster-wise analysis using different performance and behavioral measures, to further assess and characterize every cluster. To wit, we identified six different student clusters, each featuring different behaviors and performance levels. However, only four were present in the last year, which differed in terms of engagement with the course. In this paper we carefully describe each student cluster, explain how they evolved, and derive meaningful design lessons. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Through a wide range of applications and support functions, its potential for the tourism industry is significant. Gamification of tourism can contribute to a more rewarding interactions and higher level of satisfaction, as well as increase brand awareness and loyalty to the destination. As one of the first attempts to conceptualize gamification of tourism, this paper examines gaming in general terms and the application of it in specific tourism fields. It identifies game design elements that can contribute to a meaningful gamification. A few cases of best practices are presented to show how this innovative concept can benefit tourism marketing. Implications for tourism marketing and management are discussed as well as future research recommendations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence from three continents on motivation and mobile telephone use of resource-poor farmers;PLOS ONE;NA;NA;English;Article;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"LAND-USE; PARTICIPATION; TECHNOLOGIES; KNOWLEDGE; SELECTION; NETWORK; SYSTEM; EBIRD";As the sustainability of agricultural citizen science projects depends on volunteer farmers who contribute their time, energy and skills, understanding their motivation is important to attract and retain participants in citizen science projects. The objectives of this study were to assess 1) farmers' motivations to participate as citizen scientists and 2) farmers' mobile telephone usage. Building on motivational factors identified from previous citizen science studies, a questionnaire based methodology was developed which allowed the analysis of motivational factors and their relation to farmers' characteristics. The questionnaire was applied in three communities of farmers, in countries from different continents, participating as citizen scientists. We used statistical tests to compare motivational factors within and among the three countries. In addition, the relations between motivational factors and farmers characteristics were assessed. Lastly, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to group farmers based on their motivations. Although there was an overlap between the types of motivations, for Indian farmers a collectivistic type of motivation (i.e., contribute to scientific research) was more important than egoistic and altruistic motivations. For Ethiopian and Honduran farmers an egoistic intrinsic type of motivation (i.e., interest in sharing information) was most important. While fun has appeared to be an important egoistic intrinsic factor to participate in other citizen science projects, the smallholder farmers involved in this research valued 'passing free time' the lowest. Two major groups of farmers were distinguished: one motivated by sharing information (egoistic intrinsic), helping (altruism) and contribute to scientific research (collectivistic) and one motivated by egoistic extrinsic factors (expectation, expert interaction and community interaction). Country and education level were the two most important farmers' characteristics that explain around 20% of the variation in farmers motivations. For educated farmers, contributing to scientific research was a more important motivation to participate as citizen scientists compared to less educated farmers. We conclude that motivations to participate in citizen science are different for smallholders in agriculture compared to other sectors. Citizen science does have high potential, but easy to use mechanisms are needed. Moreover, gamification may increase the egoistic intrinsic motivation of farmers.;"[Beza, Eskender; Kooistra, Lammert] Wageningen Univ, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, Pb Wageningen, Netherlands; [Beza, Eskender; Reidsma, Pytrik] Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst, Ak Wageningen, Netherlands; [Steinke, Jonathan] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Steinke, Jonathan; van Etten, Jacob] Biovers Int, Turrialba, Costa Rica; [Fadda, Carlo] Biovers Int, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Mittra, Sarika] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI USA; [Mittra, Sarika; Mathur, Prem] Biovers Int, NASC Complex,Pusa Campus, New Delhi, India";"Beza, E (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, Pb Wageningen, Netherlands.; Beza, E (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst, Ak Wageningen, Netherlands.";eskender.beza@wur.nl;Kooistra, Lammert/AAW-2172-2020;"Kooistra, Lammert/0000-0001-5549-5993; van Etten, Jacob/0000-0001-7554-2558; Fadda, Carlo/0000-0003-3075-6207; Steinke, Jonathan/0000-0001-5742-702X; Reidsma, Pytrik/0000-0003-2294-809X";Strategic Funds of Wageningen UR;"This research was carried out in a PhD project and it is part of the Wageningen UR strategic program 'Mapping for sustainable intensification', 2012-2016, funded by the Strategic Funds of Wageningen UR.

Extant academic literature suggest several benefits of using EVGs including increasing students' motivation towards learning and enhancing engagement in the learning process. However, teachers are the real agents of change in the classroom and they choose whether to adopt or nor a given technological innovation in their courses. While a great effort has been devoted over the last years to better understanding EVGs effects on learning, research on teachers' acceptance of EVGs is scarcer. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive literature review has been undertaken to summarize the main findings of this stream of research. To fill this research gap, the main goal of this study is to provide a comprehensive literature review on teachers' acceptance of EVGs. Main findings suggest a wide range of barriers and drivers influencing teachers' acceptance of EVGs including i) technical and organizational support, ii) training on EVGs, iii) previous gaming experience, and iv) personal factors such as openness and innovativeness. Findings are summarized in nine propositions with implications for Teacher Training Programmes development.;"[Sanchez-Mena, Antonio; Marti-Parreno, Jose] Univ Europea Valencia, Valencia, Spain; [Sanchez-Mena, Antonio] Univ Europea Canarias, La Orotava, Spain";"Sanchez-Mena, A (corresponding author), Univ Europea Valencia, Valencia, Spain.; Sanchez-Mena, A (corresponding author), Univ Europea Canarias, La Orotava, Spain.";"antonio.sanchezmena@universidadeuropea.es; jose.marti@universidadeuropea.es";"Marti-Parreno, Jose/AAY-4787-2020; MARTI-PARRENO, JOSE/K-9311-2014";MARTI-PARRENO, JOSE/0000-0001-5928-7956;Laureate International Universities through the David A.

This research study explores the effects of gamification on young piano students' practice of technical elements such as scales, chords and arpeggios in the context of independent practice between private lessons. A control and a treatment group of ten piano students each were formed across two different private piano studios. A game-like environment was introduced for the treatment group, in which the players experienced game elements such as avatars and rewards, including points, badges and level achievements. Gamification was found to have a positive effect on the number of technical elements students mastered and a modest effect on their attitude towards practicing technical elements.

The quality of the services acts as the distinguishing feature in the industry. Furthermore, there are public standards, which lead to the permanent necessity to offer further education and training programs for employees. To meet the requirements for further training in the specific field of application within the offshore wind industry, a gamified e-learning application has been developed and is introduced in this paper. It consists of a complete solution, which contains the automated analysis of service protocols to identify qualification needs, the involvement of service technicians in the generation of learning materials, the preparation, transmission as well as the further development of those materials in accordance with the principles of e-learning. Finally, the solution contains a gamified mobile application for qualification, which is designed to meet the individual learning needs of the service technicians. This concept paper follows a problem-centred approach. Based on the current state of technology and research, the problem and motivation are identified and the urgency is verified.

During an 18-week experimental instruction period, a series of instructional activities, which included online discussions as well as classroom lectures and discussions, were conducted to enhance 32 journalism students' critical-thinking dispositions and skills. Repeated measure analysis of variance on test scores and analyses of open questions found that the participants significantly improved their critical thinking skills and dispositions through the gamified platform with the experimental instruction in a blended learning environment. The findings suggest that providing clear goals, challenges and quests, feedback, competition and cooperation, actual grading and visible status, access/unlocking content, onboarding time restrictions, freedom of choice, and new identities and roles, as well as avoidance of over-justification, contributes to achieving a meaningful gamification experience, which may further lead to self-determined learning in critical thinking.;"[Huang, Ling-Yi] Sun Yet Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Dept Literature & Media Studies, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yeh, Yu-Chu] Natl Chengchi Univ, Inst Teacher Educ, Res Ctr Mind Brain & Learning, Taipei, Taiwan";Huang, LY (corresponding author), Sun Yet Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Dept Literature & Media Studies, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;NA;NA;Yeh, Yu-chu/0000-0002-0470-0368;Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan, R.O.C.

These studies were exposed to thematically content analysis via such parameters as aim, method/design, sample, data collection, data analysis, subject employed for argumentation, type of used argumentation, argumentation model, general knowledge claim and recommendation. The results indicated that most of the argumentation studies examined the effect of argumentation on student achievement and attitudes towards science. Also, these studies under investigation mostly used experimental research design while generally preferring scales and audio-video records for data collection tools. Moreover, the argumentation activities were mostly developed in 'physics' topics and middle school level. The results of the current study suggest to deploy different methods (e.g. argumentation accompanied with gamification) to improve argumentation skills from primary school level.;"[Bag, Hasan] Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Dept Primary Educ, Fac Educ, Rize, Turkey; [Calik, Muammer] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Dept Primary Educ, Fac Educ, Trabzon, Turkey";Bag, H (corresponding author), Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Dept Primary Educ, Fac Educ, Rize, Turkey.;"hsnbag@gmail.com; muammer38@hotmail.com";CALIK, MUAMMER/AAA-1706-2019;CALIK, MUAMMER/0000-0001-8323-8783;NA;NA;NA;128;13;13;2;23;TURKISH EDUCATION ASSOC;KOCATEPE;KIZILIRMAK CADDESI NO 8, KOCATEPE, ANKARA 00000, TURKEY;1300-1337;NA;NA;EGIT BILIM;Egit.

Gamification is the recent trend that offers to increase engagement through the inclusion of game-like features like points and badges, in non-game contexts. This review will answer the following question, 'Are gamification strategies effective in increasing engagement in online programs?' Method Eight databases (Web of Science, PsycINFO, Medline, INSPEC, ERIC, Cochrane Library, Business Source Complete and ACM Digital Library) were searched from 2010 to the 28th of October 2015 using a comprehensive search strategy. Eligibility criteria was based on the PICOS format, where population included adults, intervention involved an online program or smart phone application that included at least one gamification feature. Comparator was a control group, outcomes included engagement and downstream outcomes which occurred as a result of engagement; and study design included experimental studies from peer-reviewed sources. Effect sizes (Cohens d and 95% confidence intervals) were also calculated. Results 1017 studies were identified from database searches following the removal of duplicates, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. The studies involved a total of 10,499 participants, and were commonly undertaken in tertiary education contexts. Engagement metrics included time spent (n = 5), volume of contributions (n = 11) and occasions visited to the software (n = 4); as well as downstream behaviours such as performance (n = 4) and healthy behaviours (n = 1). Effect sizes typically ranged from medium to large in direct engagement and downstream behaviours, with 12 out of 15 studies finding positive significant effects in favour of gamification.

Our results come from two experiments in France and Quebec and also from an online survey that was made available on the Classcraft platform. These results promote a model of gamification that consists of considering the experience of the students, rather than the game itself, and they confirm that a game is consubstantial to its player. Therefore, we argue for the use of the term ludicization to emphasize that transforming a situation into a game does not consist of using elements that have a game-like aspect, but rather of a non-essentialistic vision of play, generating a metaphor around the situation to build a reflexive space where the nature and meaning of interactions are modified.;"[Sanchez, Eric] Univ Fribourg, CERF, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Young, Shawn] Classcraft Studios Inc, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada; [Jouneau-Sion, Caroline] ENS Lyon, EducTice, Inst Francais Educ, Lyon, France";Sanchez, E (corresponding author), Univ Fribourg, CERF, Fribourg, Switzerland.;eric.sanchez@unifr.ch;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;28;22;23;3;13;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1360-2357;1573-7608;NA;EDUC INF TECHNOL;Educ.

In recent research, gamification learning material design is often applied to reinforce learning performance, while the prediction of gamification learning performance is seldom discussed. This study therefore applies Rough set theory to extract Core Set and generating rule, ANFIS for learning achievement predication. In order to evaluate the performance of proposed model, the VCCSEGLS dataset are collected as experimental dataset and compared with other models. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the listing models in accuracy. The three key factors are extract, (G7) Time spent on game-based learning, (L1) Examination, normal drugs and treatment, and (L2) Integration ability (time scoring, stability scoring, strain capacity, completeness scoring). The proposed model also can offer accurate predictions and provide some simple decision rules, which can be accurately used by decision-makers and game designers.;[Su, Chung-Ho] Shu Te Univ, Dept Animat & Game Design, Kaohsiung 82445, Taiwan;Su, CH (corresponding author), Shu Te Univ, Dept Animat & Game Design, Kaohsiung 82445, Taiwan.;mic6033@stu.edu.tw;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;69;0;0;5;34;WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD;SINGAPORE;5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE;0219-6220;1793-6845;NA;INT J INF TECH DECIS;Int.

The purpose of this one-group, pretest, posttest experimental study was to determine if a game could be used as an adjunct teaching method to improve students' understanding of connections between imaging findings and differential diagnoses. A novel board game focusing on differential diagnoses in thoracic radiography was developed. One hundred fourth-year veterinary students took a brief pretest, played the board game, and took a brief posttest as a part of their respective clinical radiology rotations. Pretest results were compared to posttest results using a paired t-test to determine if playing the game impacted student understanding. Students' mean scores on the posttest were significantly higher than mean pretest scores (P < 0.0001). Thus, results indicate that playing the board game resulted in improved short-term understanding of thoracic differential diagnoses by fourth-year students, and use of the board game on a clinical rotation seems to be a beneficial part of the learning process.

This context has informed the development of a literature that is heavily influenced by cause-effect framing and a focus on effectiveness. However, in recent years an alternative, critical literature has emerged that challenges some of the assumptions of the student engagement movement on the grounds of student rights and freedoms as learners. This review article identifies the following six critiques of student engagement based on an analysis of the literature and arguments stemming from analyses of the effects of neoliberalism, namely performativity, marketing, infantilisation, surveillance, gamification and opposition. It is concluded that at a policy and institutional governance level, there is a need to shift the emphasis from what and how questions concerning student engagement to consider its broader political, economic and ethical implications as a means of challenging the prevailing policy narrative.;"[Macfarlane, Bruce; Tomlinson, Michael] Univ Southampton, Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England";Macfarlane, B (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.;"bmachku@gmail.com; m.b.tomlinson@soton.ac.uk";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;58;17;17;2;32;PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD;BASINGSTOKE;BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND;0952-8733;1740-3863;NA;HIGH EDUC POLICY;High Educ.

With the growing popularity of gamification and yet mixed success of its application in educational contexts, the current review is aiming to shed a more realistic light on the research in this field by focusing on empirical evidence rather than on potentialities, beliefs or preferences. Accordingly, it critically examines the advancement in gamifying education. The discussion is structured around the used gamification mechanisms, the gamified subjects, the type of gamified learning activities, and the study goals, with an emphasis on the reliability and validity of the reported outcomes. To improve our understanding and offer a more realistic picture of the progress of gamification in education, consistent with the presented evidence, we examine both the outcomes reported in the papers and how they have been obtained. While the gamification in education is still a growing phenomenon, the review reveals that (i) insufficient evidence exists to support the long-term benefits of gamification in educational contexts; (ii) the practice of gamifying learning has outpaced researchers' understanding of its mechanisms and methods; (iii) the knowledge of how to gamify an activity in accordance with the specifics of the educational context is still limited.

Applied games including serious games (in brief, computerized games for serious purposes) and gamification (gaming elements used outside of games) have the potential to increase the impact of mental health internet interventions via three processes. First, by extending the reach of online programs to those who might not otherwise use them. Second, by improving engagement through both game-based and serious motivational dynamics. Third, by utilizing varied mechanisms for change, including therapeutic processes and gaming features. In this scoping review, we aim to advance the field by exploring the potential and opportunities available in this area. We review engagement factors which may be exploited and demonstrate that there is promising evidence of effectiveness for serious games for depression from contemporary systematic reviews. We illustrate six major categories of tested applied games for mental health (exergames, virtual reality, cognitive behavior therapy-based games, entertainment games, biofeedback, and cognitive training games) and demonstrate that it is feasible to translate traditional evidence-based interventions into computer gaming formats and to exploit features of computer games for therapeutic change. Applied games have considerable potential for increasing the impact of online interventions for mental health. However, there are few independent trials, and direct comparisons of game-based and non-game-based interventions are lacking. Further research, faster iterations, rapid testing, non-traditional collaborations, and user-centered approaches are needed to respond to diverse user needs and preferences in rapidly changing environments.;"[Fleming, Theresa M.; Bavin, Lynda; Stasiak, Karolina; Hermansson-Webb, Eve; Merry, Sally N.; Lucassen, Mathijs] Univ Auckland, Dept Med Psychol, Auckland, New Zealand; [Fleming, Theresa M.] Univ Auckland, Dept Paediat Child & Youth Hlth, Auckland, New Zealand; [Cheek, Colleen] Univ Tasmania, Rural Clin Sch, Burnie, Tas, Australia; [Lucassen, Mathijs] Open Univ, Dept Hlth Wellbeing & Social Care, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England; [Lau, Ho Ming] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Pollmuller, Britta] Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Art & Design, Auckland, New Zealand; [Hetrick, Sarah] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Youth Mental Hlth, Orygen Youth Hlth Res Ctr, Parkville, Vic, Australia";"Fleming, TM (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Med Psychol, Auckland, New Zealand.; Fleming, TM (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Paediat Child & Youth Hlth, Auckland, New Zealand.";t.fleming@auckland.ac.nz;Hetrick, Sarah Elisabeth/AAT-1277-2020;"Fleming, Theresa/0000-0002-5174-9359; Bavin, Lynda/0000-0001-8008-9364";NA;NA;NA;49;67;67;3;107;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND;1664-0640;NA;NA;FRONT PSYCHIATRY;Front.

Following this pedagogical trend, the present study aimed to enhance the face-to-face instruction in flipped classrooms with the use of clickers. A game-like clicker application was implemented through a bring your own device (BYOD) model to gamify classroom dynamics in the spirit of question-and-answer competitions. A series of flipped learning lessons were created for the study, with clickers integrated into question-and-answer activities associated with each of the lessons as formative assessments to assist students in the learning of English as a foreign language. In this quasi-experimental research, the data were gathered using a summative assessment, a perception survey, and individual interviews. The collected data were then analyzed to compare the students' flipped learning experiences, with or without clicker use. The results indicated that the gamified use of clickers had positive influences on student learning, with regard to their performance, perceptions, and preferences. This study thus suggests that the emerging generation of clicker technology allows for a cost-effective BYOD integration model in flipped classrooms, through which it is possible to seamlessly bridge pre-class and in-class activities and to effectively promote student learning.;[Hung, Hsiu-Ting] Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, 1 Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 824, Taiwan;Hung, HT (corresponding author), Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, 1 Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 824, Taiwan.;hhung@nkfust.edu.tw;NA;NA;Ministry of Science and Technology in TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST-105-2511-S-327-002-MY2];This research was sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan under the contract number MOST-105-2511-S-327-002-MY2.;NA;63;38;39;6;81;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1049-4820;1744-5191;NA;INTERACT LEARN ENVIR;Interact.

Gamification is starting to play an important role in education with the objective of providing engagement and improving the motivation of students. One specific example is the use of badges. The analysis of users' interactions and behaviors with the badge system can be used to improve the learning process, e.g., by adapting the learning materials and giving game-based activities to students depending on their interest toward badges. In this work, we propose some metrics that provide information regarding the behavior of students with badges, including if they are intentionally earning them, the concentration for achieving them and their time efficiency. We validate these metrics by providing an extensive analysis of 291 different students interacting with a local instance of Khan Academy within our courses for freshmen at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. This analysis includes relationship mining between badge indicators and others related to the learning process, the analysis of specific archetypal profiles of students that represent a broader population and also by clustering students by their badge indicators with the objective of customizing learning experiences.

Background Mobile devices and applications, which have become an integral part of our lives, are used for different purposes, including educational objectives. Among others, they are used in the process of foreign language acquisition. The use of a MALL application to learn foreign languages has advantages and drawbacks, which are important to understand, in order to achieve better learning results, while improving the enjoyment of the process. Methodology The study population included people who participated in a foreign language course and used Duolingo application on a mobile device in parallel. One group consisted of high school pupils, who were obliged to use the application and filled in before and after questionnaires. The other group consisted of people who took face-to-face courses, and chose to use the same Duolingo application voluntarily, in order to assist their studies. The second group answered another questionnaire tailored to more experienced users. The findings were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 22, and a model was examined with Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. Contribution This paper helps to understand the perceived advantages and drawbacks of using a MALL application by students both in mandatory and voluntary environments. Findings Most of the participants found the MALL Duolingo application enhanced the learning process. The gamification characteristics, ease of use, ubiquity and self-learning facilities had a stimulating effect on the process of learning, and contributed to the willingness to continue using the application and to recommend it to others. However, some statistically significant differences were found between the groups, referring to the characteristics of the application, among them ubiquity, lack of human feedback and simplicity of use. Recommendations for Practitioners The research findings can contribute to both teachers and students who conduct and participate in foreign language courses, by helping them examine the possibility of combining mobile learning with a traditional face-to-face course. Moreover, the findings can assist developers of mobile learning applications, in order to include gamification options in the process of learning. Recommendation for Researchers Researchers in the fields of mobile applications and m-learning need to understand the factors enhancing the learning process, in order to develop the next generations of m-learning applications. Impact on Society Mobile devices have become an accessory that almost every person in the world uses. Its ubiquitous characteristics allow using it everywhere and anytime. This is an opportunity to facilitate education to people all around the world. Gamification of m-learning applications can promote and encourage the use of these applications.

Design/methodology/approach - Dietrich et al. (2017) six-step framework was applied to a co-design project involving four groups of 14- to 16-year-old Australian high school students. Data collection included observations by three facilitators, written feedback from members of each group and video presentations of the generated ideas. The data analysis focused on investigating the applicability of the six-step framework to young consumers and evaluating the quality and practicality of the generated ideas. Findings - Sensitization is key to enabling young consumers to become equal participants during the co-design process. Sensitization allowed the participants to engage in the design task in a playful manner, which fostered active participation and creative insights during the co-design session. A team approach based on interactivity and group autonomy enabled adolescents to contribute insights into their specific needs and wants. This was complemented by a trusting environment and the presence of immediately available yet hands off facilitators. Research limitations/implications - The findings are limited to one specific sample and design task. Future research is required that investigates co-design with young consumers in different contexts. Practical implications - This paper provides guidance for the application of co-design with young consumers by highlighting the importance of sensitization and facilitation. Originality/value - This study marks one of the first approaches to co-designing alcohol education programs, including VR components, with young consumers.

Therefore, the online platform KOLEGEA, presented here, aims to support postgraduate training in general practice (PT in GP) in Germany through virtual interaction. Methodology: In 2012, the interdisciplinary research project KOLEGEA set up an online platform that any physicians in PT in GP can use for free after registration with their unitary continuous education number (Einheitliche Fortbildungsnummer, EFN). It offers problem-based learning and allows to discuss self-published anonymized patient cases with the community that can be classified and discussed with experienced mentors (specialists in general practice - GPs) in small virtual groups. Results: An anonymous online survey carried out as part of the 2014 project evaluation showed a good acceptance of the platform, even though shortage of time was mentioned as a limiting factor for its use. Data analysis showed that KOLEGEA was used by PPT in GP in all federal states. Patterns of passive use were predominant (90%). This report also describes the further development of the platform (in 2015 and 2016) that integrates an activity monitor as part of a gamification concept. Conclusions: Due to a low response rate of the 2014 online survey and the preliminary evaluations of usage patterns we could identify only initial trends regarding the role of KOLEGEA in supporting PPT.

Similarities and differences of the methods between gamification and games (as well as gamification and game based learning) have also been look upon up until now. However, gamification and game terms, are still being mentioned as substitutes for one another sometimes in many research articles. Although a mixture of methods are being used nowadays in the whole learning process (e.g. flipped learning together with gamification, mobile learning and infographics etc.), naming the whole learning methodology being used in an educational project/research only as gamification (or only as a game/GBL) - is yet another common issue that may lead us to misunderstand the gamification concept. These situations may be regarded as problematic issues in understanding the concept of gamification correctly. The number of educators and researchers keeps increasing in the world which are researching and trying to benefit from gamification applications in a variety of disciplines. Some of these disciplines (such as chemistry, health etc.) seems to be more benefitting and being more successful than others in their project states. Evaluating the level of success in various dimensions of learning may also differ from one to another largely in case of mixed learning methods being used in the research. Thus, in cases of using gamification method as well with others in a mixed manner of methods, the low level of success achieved may have been affected by a number of reasons. These reasons and conclusions have oriented the author to establish a research on articles and web resources on gamificaiton and its differentiations from games and game-based learning concepts. The intension is to better understand gamification, try contribute in drawing a clearer view of gamification for educators and researchers who are in the beginning stages of gamification/gamifying applications topic, or are planning to make use of them in the near future. With this perspective, a literature review was done, summerizing and commenting on the results which are reflected to this article aiming to clarify what gamification is, how it differs from games and game-based learning, familiarize with some successful gamification applications of today (in the education sector), underline how and why it is spreading in various application areas (including education) today and comment on the future of gamification use.;"[Ceker, Eser; Ozdamli, Fezile] Near East Univ, Nicosia, Cyprus";Ceker, E (corresponding author), Near East Univ, Nicosia, Cyprus.;"eser.ceker@neu.edu.tr; fezile.ozdamli@neu.edu.tr";"Ozdamli, Fezile/AAH-1826-2020; Ceker, Eser/P-1719-2019";Ceker, Eser/0000-0002-9949-4447;NA;NA;NA;23;11;12;2;22;ACAD PUBLISHER HOUSE RESEARCHER;SOCHI;UL KONSTITUTSLI, DOM 26-2 OFIS 6, SOCHI, 354000, RUSSIA;2304-9650;2305-6746;NA;EUR J CONTEMP EDUC;Eur.

Thus, structural readjustment of the teaching organization is urgently needed. Increasing proportions of gamifying teaching and experiencing teaching is an effective way to solve this problem. However, only a few studies have discussed the gamification of teaching reform in colleges. To improve the effectiveness of teaching and increase the participation of students in classrooms, the teaching reform idea and scheme of gamifying teaching and experiencing teaching were discussed in a course entitled Layout and Management of Distribution Center. The teaching reform aims to integrate comprehensive gamifying into the teaching of an entire curriculum. Specifically, small games are designed in each class during the early period to help the students learn the corresponding knowledge in games. A game-driven model of curriculum design was proposed and applied in teaching reform practice of Shijiazhuang Posts and Telecommunications Technical College. Results demonstrated that gamification of teaching reform achieves outstanding effects. Students participate in classroom activities positively, and all evaluation indexes improve year by year. Results confirm that teachers need to pay attention to systemization, gamification, and immersion of teaching design, and ensure the attractiveness and acceptability of the teaching method.;"[Wang, Fan; Wang, Yanli; Hu, Xia] Shijiazhuang Posts & Telecommun Tech Coll, Dept Express Delivery & Logist, Shijiazhuang 050021, Hebei, Peoples R China";Wang, F (corresponding author), Shijiazhuang Posts & Telecommun Tech Coll, Dept Express Delivery & Logist, Shijiazhuang 050021, Hebei, Peoples R China.;"coolbase@163.com; coolbase@163.com; coolbase@163.com";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;18;6;6;0;10;KASSEL UNIV PRESS GMBH;KASSEL;DIAGONALE 10, D-34127 KASSEL, GERMANY;1863-0383;NA;NA;INT J EMERG TECHNOL;Int.

Being a new form of aesthetic, cultural, social, and communicative experience, computer games are beginning to influence our everyday practices. Many of the processes in social life (production, labour, education, rest, communication) become mediated and playful. Game mechanics are used in non-game contexts (this process is called gamification), and due to this procedure, the experience of computer games is transmitted to the areas that are considered to entirely lack playfulness: war, pain, violence, corporeal feelings. All in all, nowadays many social relationships are formed by the game. For instance, the space of MMORPG often becomes a laboratory, where social skills are perfected, the first encounter with the other occurs, and the contours of new intersubjectivity are set. In games humans are even more unprotected than on the stage, in a reality-show, or on the battlefield because they cannot hide themselves behind the mask and have to open their face in front of the other to make the game happen. To begin the game, we let the Other (even if objectified in the form of rules) occupy our being. The article considers the examples of how the image of the Other is constructed in games, how the game space, the media field of the game, engenders certain ethical norms and ways of gaming behaviour. The way we look at each other is is determined by media, and in this sense, the game becomes more influential. This fact cannot be ignored by the social sciences, especially by those who explore media reality. Refs 33.;"[Buglak, S. S.; Skomorokh, M.

An escape game called Mine4Escape, which consists of different rooms to teach different data mining techniques (classification and association rule mining), has been developed for individuals at the undergraduate and post-graduate levels. The advantages of the proposed approach are discussed in comparison with traditional data mining training. In addition, this paper describes a dynamic scoring system designed for game-based learning. Finally, an experimental study was carried out to evaluate the performance of our learning environment by analyzing feedback received from a test group consisting of 39 undergraduate and graduate students in computer engineering. The findings from the questionnaire show that it is possible to enhance knowledge acquisition about data mining via the game-based approach. However, the degree of learning interest and information acceptance changes according to students' age, gender, educational level, and game habits.;"[Cengiz, Mehmet] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Grad Sch Nat & Appl Sci, Izmir, Turkey; [Birant, Kokten Ulas; Birant, Derya] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Izmir, Turkey; [Yildirim, Pelin] Manisa Celal Bayar Univ, Dept Software Engn, Manisa, Turkey";Cengiz, M (corresponding author), Dokuz Eylul Univ, Grad Sch Nat & Appl Sci, Izmir, Turkey.;"mehmetcengiz@cs.deu.edu.tr; ulas@cs.deu.edu.tr; pelin@cs.deu.edu.tr; derya@cs.deu.edu.tr";"YILDIRIM, Pelin/O-6422-2019; Birant, Derya/U-6211-2017";"YILDIRIM, Pelin/0000-0002-5767-2700; Birant, Derya/0000-0003-3138-0432";NA;NA;NA;38;1;1;2;38;TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS;DURRUS, BANTRY;IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND;0949-149X;NA;NA;INT J ENG EDUC;Int.

Gamification has been used widely in recent years in industry and academia as a tool for training and education. Objective: The aims of this paper are to provide an overview of gamification and digital game-based learning (DGBL), review the use of digital games in health professional education, and provide suggestions for future use in pharmacy curricula. Discussion: Many examples of game-based learning in pharmacy and other health professional curricula have been published, however the body of literature on DGBL is less developed. Overall, evaluations of these techniques show that students find them engaging and enjoyable. A recent meta-analysis of studies comparing DGBL to non-game based learning in primary, secondary, post-secondary education found that DGBL significantly enhances learning. Challenges to implementing game-based learning are financial, cultural, and technological. Conclusion: Many areas of the pharmacy curriculum could be appropriate for digital gamification. With more students entering pharmacy school familiar with video games and game-based living the time has come for pharmacy educators to explore how these instructional technologies could benefit a new generation of pharmacy students. As serious games are developed and researched in pharmacy curricula, test scores, student confidence in knowledge and skills, and retention of knowledge and skills are all outcomes that, if published, will help advance the adoption of DGBL into the pharmacy school classroom.;"[Sera, Leah] Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharm Practice & Sci, 9640 Gudelsky Dr, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; [Wheeler, Erin] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA";Sera, L (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharm Practice & Sci, 9640 Gudelsky Dr, Rockville, MD 20850 USA.;lsera@rx.umaryland.edu;Sera, Leah/S-6420-2019;Sera, Leah/0000-0002-1923-6721;NA;NA;NA;28;26;28;3;28;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;NEW YORK;360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA;1877-1297;1877-1300;NA;CURR PHARM TEACH LEA;Curr.

Playing is explored here, considering changes in student approaches to leisure, recreation and having fun and investigates how playing in general is changing. The purpose of this paper summarizes two scenarios about the playing domain from the Student Needs 2025+ project and highlights implications for the future of higher education. Design/methodology/approach - A modified version of the University of Houston's Framework Foresight method was used to explore the future of six aspects of future student life. Findings - Play has gotten serious. It is increasingly scheduled, supervised and often includes some larger objective, such as learning. This purposeful play is spreading into virtual space as well, which will increasingly be the setting for play. In the longer term, play - in the form or gamification - is likely to integrate into more and more of student life. Games and play will be used for teaching in the classroom (real and virtual), at work for training, to make exercise fun, and even in civic life for encouraging greater participation in governance. Research limitations/implications - In terms of research limitations, the paper is focused on the needs of students and does not purport to be an exhaustive analysis of all the issues influencing higher education. It views the future of higher education through the lens of students and their emerging needs. Practical implications - The paper is intended for educators, researchers and administrators to provide insight on how the needs of students, their key customers, are evolving. Originality/value - This research explores student life in its totality as way to more accurately identify student needs in the future.;[Schlehuber, Laura] Houston Foresight Program, Houston, TX 77204 USA;Schlehuber, L (corresponding author), Houston Foresight Program, Houston, TX 77204 USA.;laura.schlehuber@gmail.com;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;0;0;0;0;4;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;1074-8121;2054-1708;NA;HORIZON;Horizon;NA;2017;25;3;NA;NA;SI;NA;169;172;NA;10.1108/OTH-05-2017-0023;NA;NA;4;Education & Educational Research;Education & Educational Research;FD5UF;WOS:000407594600006;NA;NA;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

The questions, though, are which gamification approach is most suitable at that level and how to assess its suitability? This paper aims to attempt to partially answer these two questions, in the context of lean thinking education. Design/methodology/approach - The paper offers an assessment criteria to investigate the impact of lean gamification based on the evaluation of motivational, cognitive and social processing during games. In addition, a study is conducted among selected games using these assessment criteria. The study included statistical as well as comparative analysis. The study was based on a sample of undergraduate students learning various lean thinking concepts through physical games over the course of six months. Findings - Results showed different interaction levels between the three evaluation criteria depending on the type and design of the lean game. The reported scores and analysis drew various lessons on how to use gamification in the context of lean teaching, outlined some best practices in lean games design and suggested recommendations in mapping lean games from industrial domain to higher education domain. Research limitations/implications - The scope of this research was bounded by the sample size of students as well as the selected nine lean thinking games. Larger pool of students as well as other lean thinking games can offer further insights and confirm the outlined ones. Practical implications - The presented work will help lean thinking educators in higher education to better understand the student dynamics associated with engaging them in this type pf pedagogical approach. It will help guiding lean thinking games' designer on how to better cater for this segment of lean thinking learners. Finally, it will aid in promoting lean gamification as an effective learning tool. Social implications - The social impact is achieved through enhancing lean thinking education to a wide number of students. This will positively impact the society through the application of the effective lean tools at different stages, levels and places in these students' life experiences. Originality/value - This study offers one of the very few applications in gamification assessment in the context of lean thinking. Furthermore, it integrates the social processing criterion for the first time with the classical two other criteria (motivation and cognitive) used in games education assessment. Finally, it offers new insights for lean thinking game designers for higher education learners.;[Deif, Ahmed] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Ind Technol & Packaging, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA;Deif, A (corresponding author), Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Ind Technol & Packaging, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.;adeif@calpoly.edu;NA;Deif, Ahmed/0000-0003-3203-0581;NA;NA;NA;40;9;10;3;33;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2040-4166;2040-4174;NA;INT J LEAN SIX SIG;Int.

Nevertheless students' beliefs towards educational methodologies can affect both their motivation and attitude towards a given educational methodology. This study main goal is to explore key drivers of students' attitude towards the use of gamification as an educational methodology to develop their competencies. Using Keller's ARCS model (1987) a research model is developed and tested via Partial Least Squares (PLS) on a sample of 128 undergraduate students enrolled in a private Higher Education institution in Spain. Main results suggest that perceived attention, perceived relevance, and perceived confidence influence in a direct and positive way students' attitude towards the use of online educational video games to develop their competencies. Both attention and confidence also affects students' perceived relevance of online educational video games as a suitable means to develop their competencies.

Students become engaged and motivated - they learn so much more than in the traditional system. Conducting lessons becomes a pleasure, an adventure, a catharsis! While checking attendance, participation, quizzes, tasks, assignments, projects, missions, and quests on a daily basis is a bliss. Unfortunately, that is not true. That is only a dream or part of the advertising campaign of yet another so-called professional or seasoned gamifier. Preparing, organising, and designing gamified courses are not a stroll in a park. Every teacher must forsake leisure and family time alike unless they have ample support from colleagues, administration, and IT department. The purpose of this paper is to present the author's approach to gamification and share some insight into the author's experience from designing gamified courses and workshops since 2009. Design/methodology/approach - This paper concentrates on hands-on experience, mistakes, and solutions in order to approach a major issue: should we introduce gamification in education at all? Findings - In reality, gamification can be the root of all evil if done too hastily, too cheerfully, and without prior understanding of students' needs, school facilities, and our own abilities. Gamifying a classroom (or a whole school) is a massive project which should be managed with all risks, weaknesses, and threats possible to imagine. That is why, it is advisable to know what to expect, what to fear, and what to avoid in order to choose the path of righteousness, to master the trade, and to reach everlasting glory. When discussing gamification in education, we must face reality, we need to understand what gamification can provide, but also what it can devour. Educational milieu is too sensitive and our students are too precious to apply unverified solutions without the adequate preparations. Originality/value - The author offers a few answers to the question as well as a handful of suggestions towards the successful introduction of gamification in education.;[Sobocinski, Mikolaj] Kazimierz Wielki Univ Bydgoszcz, Gamedec Game Studies & Design, Bydgoszcz, Poland;Sobocinski, M (corresponding author), Kazimierz Wielki Univ Bydgoszcz, Gamedec Game Studies & Design, Bydgoszcz, Poland.;mik.sobocinski@gmail.com;Sobocinski, Mikolaj/J-2435-2017;Sobocinski, Mikolaj/0000-0002-8856-047X;NA;NA;NA;19;1;1;0;11;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2042-5953;2042-5945;NA;WORLD J SCI TECHNOL;World J.

Given the importance of motivation, educators can borrow ideas from game designers by using gamification - a process to re-frame a real life goal to be more appealing and achievable. A series of learning activities, developed to meet both cognitive and emotional needs, results in an engaging learning journey. Design/methodology/approach - The concept presented, based on PSI Theory, OCEAN Big Five character traits and player/learner archetypes, is that learners are motivated by three basic needs: affiliation, competence or certainty (assuming other physiological needs are met). Findings - Armed with insight into types of motivations at different phases, learner experience designers can create different learning journeys and user profiles. Learning activities can be planned for each need and phase based on changing motivations: collaborate and curate (affiliation), choice and ownership (certainty), challenge and accountability (competence). Research limitations/implications - Further research is needed in the area of gamification in education. A qualitative study should be conducted on preferred learning and assessment activities for each player archetype and, importantly, this research should represent broad samples and not be restricted to the online gaming community. Originality/value - Rather than focussing on an isolated unit of study, and asynchronous eLearning modules, learning designers can use modern technologies to seed and nurture learning communities where each person has an appealing pathway to enable them to move from novice to expert at their own pace in a spiral of satisfying learning.;[Denmeade, Natalie Casandra] TAFE NSW, Dept Informat Technol, Wingham, Australia;Denmeade, NC (corresponding author), TAFE NSW, Dept Informat Technol, Wingham, Australia.;natalie@moojoo.com.au;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;38;1;1;2;13;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2042-5953;2042-5945;NA;WORLD J SCI TECHNOL;World J.

Design/methodology/approach - Project System is a three-day experience for adult participants concerning totalitarian regime, freedom and inequality. The Project System does not give fast and easy answers but leads participants to find them on their own. For 30 hours, participants find themselves within a larp, which is a very intense type of role-playing game based on human interactions. The author has chosen a larp as a medium as one of the most immersive and influential method of game-based learning which can facilitate topics that are normally hard to explain through conventional methods of learning. Participants learn firsthand through their roles, emotions, story and experience. Findings - Project System was a really strong and important experience for many players that may have partially changed their lives. After more than 500 players walked through it, the author can say that this method is beneficial. Originality/value - Larp as an educational tool is used all over the world; however, there are still only few professional organizations. Most of them are focused on using larp (or similar role-playing methods) as a tool at elementary or secondary schools. Using larp in andragogy is currently pioneering.";[Kotryova, Lujza] Court Moravia, Brno, Czech Republic;Kotryova, L (corresponding author), Court Moravia, Brno, Czech Republic.;lujza.kotryova@courtofmoravia.com;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;16;0;0;0;5;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2042-5953;2042-5945;NA;WORLD J SCI TECHNOL;World J.

Nevertheless, despite an increasing academic interest in EVGs little research has been devoted to delve into teacher's beliefs affecting their attitude towards EVGs and how these beliefs also affect their intention to use EVGs in their courses. Using Keller's ARCS model as a theoretical framework, the role of perceived relevance and attention in teachers' attitude and intention to use EVGs is analyzed. To do so a research model is tested using a sample of 312 Higher Education teachers via structural equation modeling to predict teachers' attitude and behavioral intention to use EVGs in their courses. Results suggest that perceived attention drawn by EVGs is a factor affecting teachers' intentions to use EVGs in their courses. Perceived relevance was not found to affect directly neither attitude nor intention to use while teachers' perceived attention was found to affect teachers' perceived relevance of EVGs.

The application of MOOCs has technological but also pedagogical implications. MOOCs are usually driven by short video lessons, automatic correction exercises, and the technological platforms can implement gamification or learning analytics techniques. However, much more analysis is required about the success or failure of these initiatives in order to know if this new MOOCs paradigm is appropriate for different learning situations. This work aims at analyzing and reporting whether the introduction of MOOCs technology was good or not in a case study with the Khan Academy platform at our university with students in a remedial Physics course in engineering education. Results show that students improved their grades significantly when using MOOCs technology, student satisfaction was high regarding the experience and for most of the different provided features, and there were good levels of interaction with the platform (e.g., number of completed videos or proficient exercises), and also the activity distribution for the different topics and types of activities was appropriate.

The development of this design framework started as a response to complex changes in society and education (e. g. high turnover rate of knowledge, changing labour market), which require a more creative response of learners to the world problems that surround them. Many of these challenges are related to science and it would be expected that students are attracted to science, however the contrary is the case. One of the origins of this disinterest can be found in the way science is taught. Therefore, after reviewing the relevant literature we propose the SLAM framework as a tool to aid the design of science courses with high motivational impact on students. The framework is concerned with the assumption that science learning activities should be applicable and relevant to contemporary life and transferable to 'real-world' situations. The design framework proposes three design dimensions: context, technology and pedagogy, and aims at integrating learning in formal and informal contexts through blended learning scenarios by using today's flexible, interactive and immersive technologies (e. g. mobile, augmented reality, virtual reality).;"[Bidarra, Jose] Univ Aberta, Dept Sci & Technol, Lisbon, Portugal; [Rusman, Ellen] Open Univ, Welten Inst, Heerlen, Netherlands";Bidarra, J (corresponding author), Univ Aberta, Dept Sci & Technol, Lisbon, Portugal.;"jose.bidarra@uab.pt; ellen.rusman@ou.nl";Bidarra, Jose/M-9115-2013;Bidarra, Jose/0000-0002-2082-5996;NA;NA;NA;54;12;12;1;39;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0268-0513;1469-9958;NA;OPEN LEARN;Open Learn.;NA;2017;32;1;NA;NA;NA;NA;6;20;NA;10.1080/02680513.2016.1265442;NA;NA;15;Education & Educational Research;Education & Educational Research;EO3QM;WOS:000396609300002;NA;Other Gold;NA;NA;06/05/2021;NA

However, mHealth tools, e.g. apps, often have low rates of retention, eroding their potential benefits. Using incentives is a common mechanism for engaging, empowering and retaining patients that is applied by mHealth tools. We conducted a systematic review aiming to categorize the different types of incentive mechanisms employed in mHealth tools for diabetes management, which we defined as incentive-driven technologies (IDTs). As an auxiliary aim, we also analyzed barriers to adoption of IDTs. Methods: Literature published in English between January 2008-August 2014 was identified through searching leading publishers and indexing databases: IEEE, Springer, Science Direct, NCBI, ACM, Wiley and Google Scholar. Results: A total of 42 articles were selected. Of these, 34 presented mHealth tools with IDT mechanisms; Education was the most common mechanism (n = 21), followed by Reminder (n = 11), Feedback (n = 10), Social (n = 8), Alert (n = 5), Gamification (n = 3), and Financial (n = 2). Many of these contained more than one IDT (n = 19). The remaining eight articles, from which we defined barriers for adoption, were review papers and a qualitative study of focus groups and interviews. Discussion: While mHealth technologies have advanced over the last five years, the core IDT mechanisms have remained consistent. Instead, IDT mechanisms have evolved with the advances in technology, such as moving from manual to automatic content delivery and personalization of content. Conclusion: We defined the concept of IDT to be core features designed to act as motivating mechanisms for retaining and empowering users. We then identified seven core IDT mechanisms that are used by mHealth tools for diabetes management and classified 34 articles into these categories.";"[de Ridder, Michael; Kim, Jinman; Jing, Yan] Univ Sydney, Biomed & Multimedia Informat Technol BMIT Res Grp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [de Ridder, Michael; Kim, Jinman; Jing, Yan] Univ Sydney, Inst Biomed Engn & Technol BMET, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Kim, Jinman] Nepean Hosp, Nepean Telehlth Technol Ctr, Kingswood, NSW, Australia; [Khadra, Mohamed] Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Nanan, Ralph] Univ Sydney, Nepean Clin Sch, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Nanan, Ralph] Univ Sydney, Charles Perkins Ctr Nepean, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia";de Ridder, M (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Level 5,Bldg J12, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.;michael.deridder@sydney.edu.au;NA;"Nanan, Ralph/0000-0002-1749-6378; kim, jinman/0000-0001-5960-1060";Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council;The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported in part by the Australian Research Council.

Although gamification has a great potential in higher education, existing research focuses on competitive approaches and presents contrasting evidence. We present a social gamification approach and tool designed to address the situated motivational affordances of students (relatedness, competence and autonomy). An experiment (N = 374) is conducted to test it in an undergraduate course, comparing students' performance with a traditional blended-learning approach. Students' attitude towards the new tool is also analyzed. Results suggest that social gamification can be used to improve the overall academic performance in practical assignments and to promote social interaction. However, our findings also raise and important caveat.

The interest in raising learners' competences in foreign languages has been a fact in the last few decades. In this sense, approaches integrating the learning of non-linguistic content through a vehicular language that is not the learners' mother tongue have been widely used around the world. However, it seems that some benefits of those approaches integrating language and content could be further strengthened if the time of exposure to content and language was higher and if students were highly motivated to learn. To this purpose, this article suggests that serious videogames could be a suitable tool to provide learners with further teaching support and increase their motivation in a playful context and introduces a model that aims at gamifying and integrating content and language learning through serious videogames.;[Casan Pitarch, Ricardo] Univ Jaume 1, Av Vicent Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain;Pitarch, RC (corresponding author), Univ Jaume 1, Av Vicent Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.;casanr@uji.es;Pitarch, Ricardo Casan/F-4774-2018;Pitarch, Ricardo Casan/0000-0002-1689-7954;NA;NA;NA;61;2;2;1;2;NATL RESEARCH UNIV HIGHER SCH ECONOMICS;MOSCOW;SHABOLOVKA, 26, MOSCOW, 119049, RUSSIA;NA;2411-7390;NA;J LANG EDUC;J.
